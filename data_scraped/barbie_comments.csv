Michael Cera REALLY earned his moment when Allan fights all those construction workers. I am SO glad they didn't make him completely useless.,2023-07-21
The cut to the Depressed Barbie commercial was GOLD.,2023-07-21
The line at the very beginning of the movie that talks about how little girls only played with baby dolls which only allows them to play as a mother until Barbie came around. I had never thought about it before but it feels so true!,2023-07-21
"That Ken war sequence that was half battle/half musical elaborate dance sequence was perhaps the hardest I‚Äôve ever laughed at a movie.

The fucking Depression Barbie ad had me cackling.,2023-07-21
The people suggesting to see Barbie before Oppenheimer so you don‚Äôt start Barbie with an existential crisis have not considered that you leave Barbie with an existential crisis.,2023-07-21

The unexpected cameo of the BBCs Pride and Prejudice had me ROLLING with the accuracy,2023-07-21
Very unrealistic Ken doesn't have nipples how could a titty twister be that effective,2023-07-22
my favorite moment was when barbie and ken were first hitting the streets of venice beach and everyone‚Äôs judging their outfits till two gays walk by and say ‚Äúcuuuuuuute‚Äù üò≠ i was dying,2023-07-21
"Nothing could've prepared me for the man's love of horse aesthetics üò≠üòÇ

The trailer was right - it's perfect for people who love and hate Barbie. My favorite part was when I think Ferrera(?) said ""and now we're doing that to a doll"" when referencing the judgement passed and critiquing. It's just a doll yet it's received so much criticism for doing arguably nothing. I love the layers.",2023-07-21
There was a mini foosball table on top of the large foosball table in the dojo casa and it made me chuckle way more than it should have.,2023-07-21
"I had no clue what to expect walking into the theatre for this movie, but it was brilliant. It was really nice to see the movie hit on so many important points in a light-hearted way. And I don't know about anyone else's experience, but it was super cute how almost everyone in the theatre was wearing pink and how there was such a large age range watching!",2023-07-22

"While Ryan Gosling indisputably stole the show, the Jenga wall killed me for some reason. I was laughing almost nonstop through this entire movie. So so good.

PSA - ‚ÄúI am Kenough‚Äù merch dropped on Mattel Creations today.,2023-07-21
This movie was fucking weird and I loved it. It was like they turned Toy Story into a Black Mirror episode and made it funny.,2023-07-22
This is probably cause I usually watch movies on a Tuesday at 2 pm when no one is there but I have to say watching this movie in a packed theater full of people wearing pink and with people just literally laughing out loud all throughout the movie was a very special experience.,2023-07-21
"They did an excellent job bringing Barbieland to life. I feel like I need to watch it again because there are so many little colorful details everywhere you look.

Also John Cena as the merman with Dua Lipa was unexpected lol",2023-07-21
"I am in love with the scene in which Barbie sees an old lady sitting near her at the bus stop. It was gorgeously shot and felt so warm. Barbie, a plastic doll, is the epitome of incredibly unrealistic beauty standards ‚Äî and so to have a personification of that concept meet an aging woman for what seems like the very first time, and for Stereotypical Barbie to say, with utmost sincerity, that the lady is beautiful‚Ä¶ Waterworks!!! And for the lady to reply, ‚ÄúI know!‚Äù Gosh, it was so lovingly done. I‚Äôm still thinking about this scene hours after, and it will for sure stick with me for a long time.

Also MAGIC EARRING KEN! GROWING UP SKIPPER! What a fever dream of a film.",2023-07-21
"Barbie: *(In tears)* I‚Äôm not Stereotypical Barbie pretty anymore!

The Ken War was very epic. My favorite line had to be the 4th wall break about how Margot Robbie was the wrong person to cast for the role when Barbie was calling herself ugly. My entire theatre laughed.,2023-07-21
"Curious for all the movie refences, I got: 2001 space odyssey, matrix, saving private ryan? (Beach war), generic teen movies (removing the glasses)",2023-07-21
I absolutely loved that they included Earring Magic Ken.,2023-07-21
"The Mattel Logo blocking Issa Rae‚Äôs (President Barbie) ‚ÄúMother F‚Äôer‚Äù was hilarious and was not expecting John Cena to show up as a mermaid. Also, an nice surprise was incorporating Rhea Pearlman as Ruth Handler, the creator of Barbie, as part of the story. Did the ending imply she was actually a ghost?",2023-07-21
The scene about how Depression Barbie rewatches the BBC Pride and Prejudice had my theatre busting up üòÇ,2023-07-22
Barbie falling over in defeat was a great bit of physical comedy from Margot Robbie.,2023-07-21
I lost it when President barbie called Ken a motherfucker,2023-07-24
I found myself laughing hysterically any time Michael Cera was on screen. Regardless of what he said or did,2023-07-22
"Protect Allan at all costs ü•∫

I love how Allan simply wears the same outfit throughout the film with the exception of the cute sparkly bow tie suit at the dance. 

Even when the Kens took over, he doesn't change other than having a Ken patch on it.",2023-07-21
"Overall I can‚Äôt get over how *fun* this movie was. The dance sequences were all incredible, and the jokes consistently landed. Shout-out to Michael Cera for being effortlessly hilarious as poor Allan.",2023-07-21
"I was so worried when Barbie first met Sasha that the movie was about to become Barbie teaching her about being more positive, etc. I was thrilled when that didn't happen.

Honestly, I thought I had this movie figured out from the trailers but it just kept swerving in the best possible ways.

Loved the worldbuilding. Some light exposition and then handwaves the rest of the way, like Will Ferrell just casually mentioning that Ruth was a ghost with an office. Like, any other movie would've had the humans spend a lot more time questioning if Barbie was Barbie rather than accepting it within a single scene.

Also, can someone tell me what Allen said right before taking on the Kens? My audience was laughing so hard I didn't hear it. And I better see blurry Midge edited into the background a bunch of famous movie scenes.",2023-07-21
One super great detail I noticed is at the end when she's a human Barbie now has eye bags and her skin isn't totally airbrushed/makeuped. You can see freckles and other little things. She's pretty but still human.,2023-07-23
Simu Liu did a lot more and had more lines than I expected. I saw him in the initial trailer and thought he would be a complete side character (he is a side character) but he got more lines and screen presence than I expected.,2023-07-21

"Genuinely shocked that Mattel let that joke about their co-founder and Barbie's inventor committing tax invasion make it into the final cut. Either they must have great senses of humor about themselves, or Greta Gerwig is great at negotiating ironclad contracts.",2023-07-22

"If anyone has the lyrics to that opening song I‚Äôm going to need them right now. ‚ÄúK is for death!‚Äù

The ‚ÄúI Am Kenough‚Äù fuzzy hoodie goes unbelievably hard,2023-07-25
"""I'm not beautiful""

Narrator: ""Margot Robbie was the wrong casting to make this point"".

Everybody in the cinema erupted at that line.

Ryan Gosling's back must be in pain from carrying this film. His comic timing is incredible, as is his absolute commitment to the over the top tone. The Ken song and dance was amazing.",2023-07-21
"I think someone could write a whole essay about the scene when Barbie told that elderly woman on the bench that she is beautiful.

Barbie had been looking at her new imperfections and saw them as elements that devalue her as a person (or doll). Yet she is able to look at this woman, who has qualities that Barbie would consider flaws if applied to her, and sincerely see her as a beautiful person. It shows that even when Barbie hates herself, she is able to appreciate those around her. We see her compassion and appreciation for others, which contrasts with her personal insecurity.

We also get to see her taking in the real world and it‚Äôs imperfections: some people are having the time of their lives and others are have the worst day of their life. People in the same place aren‚Äôt all going to be collectively happy no matter what, because each person has their own complicated and imperfect life. It‚Äôs a pivotal moment in Barbie‚Äôs character development as a compassionate person and gradual growth into a more confident individual throughout the movie.

It‚Äôs also just such a warm, heartfelt and wholesome moment, which I always like to see done in a sweet, but not cheesy way.",2023-07-21

Everyone is talking about Ken but let‚Äôs not forget about my boy Allen. He just wants to get out!,2023-07-21
Throughout the film I felt like they were going to reveal that The CEO was an escaped Ken. He had manic Ken energy and knew how to get to Barbie World despite seemingly never having been there. Curious if that was an abandoned plot thread. Did anyone else have that sense or am I alone?,2023-07-21
I AM KENOUGH,2023-07-22
"This is so minor in the scheme of other things they got away with but using the Mattel logo to censor Issa Rae‚Äôs motherfucker genuinely tickled me

Definitely didn‚Äôt think that the biggest product placement in the movie would be a Chevy commercial. 

Didn‚Äôt see Ken becoming a villain coming at all.  

Push by Matchbox Twenty was so perfect, my god.  

Michael Cera as Allan got some of my biggest laughs ‚Äúall Ken‚Äôs clothes fit me!‚Äù as a battle cry as he started taking out the group of Kens cracked me up.  

Was that ‚Äúsi se puede‚Äù line a little nod to America Ferrera‚Äôs role in Gotta Kick It Up? Sure do hope so.  

Cried a few tears. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna be something that‚Äôs made. I wanna do the imagining.‚Äù

"""Oh I don't have a vagina, and he does not have a penis.""

""...that's ok.""",2023-07-29
"

- ""Push"" was the official Ken anthem because Ryan Gosling has been sitting on a first rate Matchbox 20 impression for 25+ years and no, you cannot convince me otherwise.
- If someone doesn't make the tie-dyed *I am Kenough* hoodie available for purchase immediately, it will be a crime. Same goes for Depression Barbie, because I've never felt so seen. She will also be the perfect last minute lazy cosplay idea (she's always wearing sweatpants!) come Halloween or comic convention time. 
- Loved Helen Mirren as the narrator pointing out that Margot Robbie was way too beautiful an actress to believably have an existential crisis over no longer being pretty enough. For real though, Margot literally and figuratively *glowed* the entire time she was onscreen. 
- Shoutout to Greta Gerwig for calling out Justin Timberlake's big ""Just Allan"" energy. Let's be real, we've all sensed it on a spiritual level. 
- America Ferrera was the perfect person to deliver that monologue about what it means to be a woman. It would have been cheesy or clich√©d in a lesser performer's hands, but she really made you feel the rage and exhaustion behind every contradiction. 
- Speaking of performers who elevated the material, how the fuck did Margot Robbie just make me cry in the same movie as an ""I'm Just Ken"" dance battle? Her connection with Ruth and genuine desire to be human got me good, somehow. 
- Shoutout to that one Ken in the battle scene whose weapon of choice was titty twisters. 
- ""As soon as I found out the patriarchy wasn't mainly about horses, I kinda lost interest"" had me dying. Ryan played the lovable himbo so well. Even his heel turn was 75% costume driven. 
- Issa Rae getting the one Mattel bleeped out swear in the movie just felt right. Don't come for President Barbie or she'll put you in your place, motherfucker. 
- The cut to credits joke was flawless. ""I'm here to see my gynecologist"" is 10/10, no notes. Talk about throwing Barbie into the deep end.",2023-07-21
The Michael Cera scene where he fights all the construction workers building the wall vertically reminds me of Scott Pilgrim saves the world. You don‚Äôt see Cera in fight scenes all the time or anything. Good scene.,2023-07-21
"I‚Äôll take a high level, high paying job with influence, please",2023-07-30
"My thoughts:

1. The film equivalent of a big handful of confetti. A lot happening, a little everywhere, but super fun if you just sit back and enjoy it.
2. The Lizzo song/narration that changed into a ditty about existential dread was hilarious.
3. Michael Cera is just Michael Cera-ing, but it works really well here.
4. I now want to see if they can figure out a sequel just to get more Ryan Gosling as Ken.
5. People, can't you put your phone down for two fucking hours and just watch the damn film? Geez.",2023-07-21
"Low key, one of the realest & funniest things for me was the scene where Ken(s) hilariously and self-indulgently played guitar AT Barbie(s).

I felt personally attacked when Ken was talking financial stuff with Barbie. Made me feel for what my wife has to listen to.

my favorite part of the movie was the absurdity in the way characters traveled between the real world and barbieland. the fact that it HAD to be in a specific sequence of vehicles and it always started/ended in Venice Beach. very funny running gag,2023-07-25
"As an Asian-American man, I was so happy to see Simu Liu get to play such a prominent role and be portrayed as handsome and a legitimate peer to Ryan Fucking Gosling, all without any of his identity being tied to his race. No kung-fu jokes, no tongue-in-cheek remarks, no mocked accents, just a handsome man getting to be a handsome man on screen.

*edit* I apologize if a man being like ‚Äúyay, a man!‚Äù regardless of race comes across as ignorant. I was just excited to see it because there have really been very few instances of Asian men being portrayed as sexy/handsome in mainstream U.S. media, especially with their race not being a legitimate part of their character.",2023-07-23

my country is very religious and patriarchal, and i seldom see western feminist movies bc they arent really available here. 

I was on the edge of my seat all the time and cheering for barbie and ken. haha 

I felt so seen and empowered by the movie. and I laughed a lot as well. all the cast was lovable. 

I really indentified with stereotipical barbie and ken thru this movie. With Barbie bc she wasn't astronaut barbie, nobel prize barbie etc, she was just the basic barbie that everyone thinks is very basic. I am very basic person as well with mostly homemaking ambitions, and thats all.

When she broke down and said she s waiting for the more leadership orientated barbie to save the day, I felt so seen! lol smth I wonder how I can survive without my leadership orientated barbie in my life. But the movie teaches the nice lesson to be in control more as well.

my new mantra from now on is: I'm just Ken, and that's enough. And im great doing stuff. lol  

both Ken and Barbie had amazing roles in the movie and made me feel stuff. haha taught me life lessons.",2023-07-24

"I want to comment on something I haven't seen many other comments on. I know it's easy to see Ken as just the patriarchy villain, but I actually think they did a better job at handling it than that. He's pretty obviously an innocent, trying to find his identity in a world he has zero experience in, and his adoption of the patriarchy didn't really feel malicious to me, so much as him trying on an identity to see if it felt right. I felt like they made it obvious that he wasn't really a villain, and more looking for a way to form his own identity in parallel to Barbie having her own journey to do so. Only difference was, she had a guide in real people, and Ken never really did. He seems to let go of it pretty easily at the end, and I think they were making an interesting statement about the ease with which someone with little experience can get suckered in to a darker world view. The toxicity of internet culture, in particular what's geared towards young men comes to mind, and I thought they did a really good job presenting it this way.",2023-07-22

I don't know if anyone else felt this way, but it just perfectly described the disconnect between men and women to me. Sometimes in my relationships with men I feel this way too.

"I loved the movie, and am eagerly awaiting the long-expected Culture War it will spark (a few FB friends already lambasting it for woke propaganda).

One observation I havent seen made much is regards to Ken. A few critics have accused the film of ""Pulling its Punches"" with regards to Ken in the end.

How I saw it was that Ken wasn't a representation of Tate/Petersen/RedPill leaders, so much as a representation of the naive 12 year old boys who don't know enough about the world to not fall for it.

(Spoilers below)
Ken's arc concludes with having to realize that his purpose and sense of self-worth should not revolve around his access to women. This feels like something applicable to the incel movement, whete their entire social worldview is rooted on whether or not women will sleep with them. I think that the film didnt so much pull it's punches on the Kens, so much as falter a little on driving home the point that they need to work on themselves before they can earn what they feel 'entitled' to.

Great film, way deeper than it had any right to be, and I've already seen one 90 minute YT review from a neckbeard lambasting the ""woke"" war.

"It felt like there were two parts of this movie, and the division happens at some point during the Ken takeover. I won't rehash them in much depth, but I agree with all the comments about heavy-handedness and aimlessness, the second half is mostly air. Also, aside from Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera, the supporting cast was pretty useless, could have been played by anyone, the characters were empty and pointless (wow, I just called Will Ferrell useless).

\*However\*... the first half was freaking hilarious and very creative. I love how the movie embraced Barbie surrealism. I enjoyed Barbie drinking fake liquid and Ken smashing into the plastic ocean waves. I laughed a ton - some of my favorite moments included Gen Z'ers calling Barbie a fascist (I totally know Gen Z'ers who would do this), Ken talking to the mom and her daughter at the school about Barbie being kidnapped, Ken and Barbie in cowboy costumes (the fringe!!!). All the weird discontinued Barbies had me howling, especially pregnant Barbie. Michael Cera's character felt like it sprang from a joke in the writer's room about how funny it would be to awkwardly insert Michael Cera into this movie, and it worked.

I think this is a movie I'll go back to a lot when I'm high, and never finish it, but I'm glad I saw it through the once. I feel like all the criticisms are super valid, but I def get why it's a smash.",2023-08-04

I can definitely resonate much more with that message than what 4chan‚Äôs and the Shapiro‚Äôs of the world had led me to believe- that ‚Äúthis is a film about men being slaves and rising up, only to become slaves again at the end because all men are evil and stupid and weak compared to women‚Äù.

"Just saw the movie last night. I enjoyed it, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were great - they did a good job. Really, all of the cast were great in their roles and with what they were given. The movie was more 'meta' than I was expecting it to be, and I thought it was well-executed more than it wasn't. However, overall I thought the movie was half-baked (two-thirds-baked? some fraction of not fully baked?! I don't know) - I get the intent behind it, I just thought it wasn't executed as tightly or cleverly as it could have been.

I think back to 'Enchanted"", which to me has a very similar premise and very similar messaging, but I thought was done much better with more fun and more heart than Barbie. Even the 'ridiculous' moments like the spontaneous musical numbers felt more 'natural' in Enchanted than the ridiculous moments in Barbie.

But man, Margot Robbie is \*spot on\* casting though.",2023-08-13
"Just saw the movie tonight in a mostly empty theater. Overall enjoyed it but there were parts that didn't land (also that NSYNC slander, what!!).

That was a heartrending moment, and probably my favorite one.

The parody commercial of a depressed Barbie eating a family sized bag of Starbursts and binge watching Pride and Prejudice. 

I also enjoyed the cerebral stream of consciousness moments juxtaposed with how pink and cartoonish everything was presented haha.

I'm happy kenough with it though, the hype is justified and it was fun to have seen a Hollywood blockbuster that was never afraid to be weird.

"Overall, I liked it. It was very funny. You really ended up caring for and connecting with Barbie and Ken because of Margot and Ryan. They were hysterically funny at times. Rarely do I laugh out loud to movies but this one got me several times.


I felt like the movie was supposed to be 30 minutes longer, but was forced to be cut down. The pacing in most of the movie, and particularly the first half, was terrible. Everything went by too fast. The movie didn't have time to breathe, which hurt some of the potential comedy and made many of the ""emotional"" moments later feel unearned and forced.


When Barbie sat on the bench and told the old woman she was beautiful, it wasn't as sweet a moment as it could have been, because the pacing was terrible. Just before, the movie jumped ultra-fast between events, and suddenly it slowed to a halt out of nowhere. This makes the moment feel tacked on and unnatural. The pacing was a consistent problem in the movie.


The mother and daughter characters (I don't even remember their names) also didn't have enough time to breathe. Barbie and Ken, who were not even fully ""human"", felt WAY more ""human"" to me than the mother and daughter, because they had more time to 'breathe', so to speak.

When the mother had her monologue about patriarchy, it could have felt way more satisfying than it did. I wished I felt the way about the monologue as I did with Taraji P. Henson's in [Hidden Figures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j6p7ajuh-E), or Laura Dern's in [Marriage Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpwbyrpzi4Y), or Frances McDormand's in [Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Erg09oOpmo). Monologues out of frustration and anger can be so damn satisfying. The message of the monologue was fantastic, but because the character was so underdeveloped, and everything so rushed, it was more eye-rolling than satisfying. It was cringe-inducing coming from that character.

All media should try to ""show"" and not ""tell"", and this movie failed here. The movie had already shown its message - the executives at Mattel are all male, and they have created a fake version of ""woman"", and imposed that ideal on real women and girls. They *literally* try to force Barbie into a box representing this ideal, and she refuses. It's way more satisfying, as an audience member, to figure out the message ourselves rather then being told it explicitly. She didn't need the patriarchy monologue to be that explicit and unnaturally forced. It could have been satisfying (like the monologues I posted earlier), but this one failed for me

The daughter was also extremely underdeveloped. It was like she was written by a 50 year old who tried to make a parody of ""annoyed gen z teenager"". No teenager actually acts like that. Why did she suddenly bring up the genocide of american indigenous people? No teenager actually says ""that's appropriating"" when their father speaks spanish. The ""annoyed teenager"" can be pulled off MUCH better, like in Bo Burnham's Eight Grade, which featured the ""annoyed teenager"" as a real human being with thoughts and emotions. This one felt like a megaphone, not a character.

The positives:

- Insanely funny, most of the time

- Margot Robbie was a developed, three-dimensional, hilarious main character who you felt tremendous empathy for

- Ryan Gosling has never been more funny and charismatic in a movie, ever. This was Oscar nomination worthy

- Overall fantastic message, and I'm overjoyed it didn't try to defend Barbies as being ""feminist, actually"". From the first few minutes, it mocked the idea that Barbies are ""empowering"" for women and girls. Barbies are top-down manufactured ideals of ""femininity"", and ""femininity"" is NOT what being a woman/girl is. It's a masquerade imposed on them top-down. The movie understood this.

- Opening scene was incredible, closing scene was hilarious, leaving you with an overall good impression


The negatives:


- Felt way too rushed and cut down

- The mom and daughter characters were awfully underdeveloped, making them more cringe-worthy than relatable

- Some of the humor with the Mattel executives fell completely flat as they, too, were underdeveloped. Some of the jokes felt like they would be funny if you knew the characters, but we never got time to know them.


Most of the problems may be fixed if the movie was 30 minutes longer, and all the side characters got time to breathe.

"I'm a grown ass man who doesn't have anything pink in his wardrobe. Never cared for anything to do with Barbie or it's fan culture. I went with some friends expecting a cringefest. I had heard all the stuff about how it was the wokest movie ever and trashed men so I was bracing for the worst.


I can't remember the last time I left a cinema feeling as happy as I did leaving this one.


It was super fun throughout. The designs of the sets and characters are a perfect 10. The acting was incredible. I so badly want a Ken spinoff cuz Gosling killed it. The music and dance performances are awesome.


In regards to the themes of the film, I found the ending to be so touching. 


People say the movie trashes men but I found Ken deciding he was Kenough to be heartwarming. There's 2 big struggles we face today as men. Feeling like we need a girl to love us to have any meaning in life and then feeling like we need to be more manly and dominant to be true men. And Gosling managed to make you feel those struggles whilst simultaneously being hilarious and charming whilst doing it. There's no cliche happy ending where the Kens immediately get perfect equality cuz that is something that takes a long time as we see in real life. And that's ok to me cuz it's acknowledged that they will follow the path of women did in real life. 


And a similar thing is done for Barbie's character where she rejects the idea that she needs to be a trailblazer for women after seeing that the fantasy world of Barbieland really wasn't a saviour for women and avoids the stereotypical trope of most movies where the girl falls in love with the guy for a cliche happy ending whilst still apologising for how she treated Ken before. She could have had a life of immortality with systematic privilege but learned that it's not right and being the flawed humans we are is beautiful. People deserve to be acknowledged but are not entitled to love. And the ending gag is just perfect. Funny and also shows the beauty of normalcy. Both the male and female main characters end the movie in a similar way even if with different literal outcomes.


The patriarchy stuff was absolutely hilarious in it's execution and I feel bad for anyone who couldn't enjoy it. The fact that they show that Ken couldn't get a job in the real world out of the virtue of being a man cuz he lacked skills showed that the movie is not literally saying today is a patriarchal oppression but redpillers gonna do what they do. I have conservative views on quite a few topics and am first to call out liberal agendas but this movie was not it to me. I feel like anyone can appreciate it regardless on political leaning if you don't take everything at face value. I also feel like they use the little girl character as a satire of Gen Z liberals who just want to hate everything so it's not like the movie was an F U to conservatives. 
I feel like this movie has something for everybody of any sex,age,political leaning etc and we just need to stop taking ourselves too seriously. 
 

This is a movie that you can take a lot from. But to me,it's about how we don't need to live life having a higher calling from our sex or to dedicate it to chasing a member of the opposite. We just need to be ourselves. 


I'm glad the movie is such a big success. Robbie and Gosling have shot up my list of favourites actresses/actors. Top tier work from both of them.",2023-07-25

The real plot is ‚ÄúBarbie becomes fascinated by death and sets herself on the road to someday die‚Äù 

Barbie is STILL ‚Äúirrepressible thoughts of death‚Äù Barbie. 

She met an old woman, having never encountered aging/death, and thought: that‚Äôs beautiful. 

She met a ghost and said: make me like you. 

She made herself mortal when given the chance, so that someday she‚Äôd inevitably die. 

If we cut to Barbie three years from now in the real world, maybe she‚Äôll have a lotta skull tattoos, green and black hair, and a lip ring. 

Like weird barbie, stereotypical Barbie has permanently changed.  

She will now always be irrepressible thoughts of death Barbie.",2023-07-30
"Watched it for the first time last night and the theater was still packed. No idea how this movie is ""anti-men"" unless you have zero media literacy. Ken realizes that he's not Beach Ken or Barbie's Boyfriend, but his own self-actualized person with a self-worth that's unconnected to his relationships or profession -- ""I'm Kenough"". Men would be a lot happier if they adopted that mindset instead of trying to achieve what they think women want.",2023-08-10
"First half was good and had several funny moments, but they lost the plot in the second half.  Instead of focusing in on how neither the real world patriarchy or Barbieland matriarchy was ideal, but a compromise that respects everyone is better, they just kind of muddled through the ending with some long winded preaching.  

If the Mattel executive never appeared at the end it would have made no difference, but they where there and got a bunch of screen time for some reason.

> Forget the Barbie marketing-- Warners is selling the candy-colored Trojan horse for a wickedly smart satire of gender roles in our society, well-delivered by writers Gerwig and Baumbach, director Gerwig, and a smart cast. Robbie delivers and Gosling is the MVP. Big B.O. + Oscars.",2023-07-21

"Just saw the film today and plan on going again next week. Ryan Gosling stole the show as Ken and really made me feel for his character - he was easily my favorite part of the film. He was able to make jokes that weren't even that funny work due to his charisma and comedic timing, plus his emotional scenes at the end were so well done. Margot did a very good job as Barbie but I feel we didn't get to spend more time with her. Although I'll admit her final scene with Ruth was very touching. 
The mother daughter duo fell flat for me, as well as the Mattel execs who in all honesty didn't need to be in the film since they didn't really do anything substantial.
 
It's a visually stunning film and I really love the set design of Barbieland as well as the different Barbies & Kens. But the script needed to be tightened up in places.",2023-08-03

"Saw it for a second time last night, I was still a wreck by the end. Anyone with mommy issues knows what I mean.

I also didn't appreciate the initial wave of user reviews that were upset/critical about Ken becoming an incel/misogynist. I think it perfectly captures how many young boys perceive the world through the lens of being a ""high-value male"" after feeling that they only exist for the gaze of a woman in their adolescent years, especially now with dickheads like Andrew Tate spoon-feeding them rat poison. I think it could have been delved into more, but I appreciated the line from Margot Robbie about finding out who you are without being attached to another person, by proxy of removing the ""It's X and Y"" and replacing it with ""It's X **and** it's Y!"" Just really a fan of self-empowerment to help people make better relationships without being codependent on one another for validation.

Will Ferrell is also hilarious comic relief as a parody of ""woke"" brands. By woke I mean the let's slap a rainbow on the logo for June and then keep donating to anti-LGBT groups version of woke. Pretty much exemplified by the ending where he rejects normal Barbie until he hears that it will print money for Mattel.",2023-08-16
"This movie hit a sweet spot for me in terms of blending goofy, campy, ""dumb"" humor with more clever, snappier jokes. Not every specific bit landed with me, but overall I like its full commitment to the absurdity of the world. *This is silly and kinda ridiculous, so let's just freakin'* go *for it and embrace that inherent goofiness.* I find that type of unapologetic boldness pretty endearing.

I haven't really waded into all the discourse about the politics of this movie -- is it feminist? is it feminist in the proper way? is it woke? is it not woke enough? is it sufficiently subversive? is it secretly capitalist propaganda? Not that those questions are irrelevant, to be clear. The social commentary in this movie is, of course, upfront and unsubtle. But I didn't go in expecting, like, an Andrea Dworkin Barbie or a Barbie recitation of the SCUM Manifesto or anything similarly outright confrontational, nor was I expecting to have my worldview forever altered by the searingly insightful social critique of a PG-13 summer blockbuster. I wanted some good laughs and some pleasantly basic pro-women messaging, and that's what I got, so I'm satisfied there.

As many others have highlighted, Gosling is superb. I knew he had good comedic chops from The Nice Guys, but I think there's a difference between being willing to ""look silly"" doing Shane Black faux-lowbrow-but-actually-highbrow dialogue and willing to ""look silly"" in something as outlandish and garish and campy as Barbie. It really feels like he's having an absolute *blast* playing Ken. He and Robbie both feel so committed to their characters, and even though there are times when the movie winks at the audience a bit (I'm thinking of a specific 4th-wall breaking bit of meta narration that I don't want to spoil), it doesn't feel like either of the two leads are winking in their performances -- *haha, isn't it just so silly that I'm in a movie like this?* Their commitment really sells the movie's heart.

And speaking of heart: America Ferrera, take a bow. She always oozes this sort of relatable sincerity, and her role really adds to the emotional depth of the film overall. I do wish the movie had spent a bit more time setting up the dynamic between her and her daughter; their arc felt cute and heart-warming but didn't really *move* me because I didn't ever really truly sense the tension between them. It was there in the dialogue, but I didn't *feel* it. But that shortcoming falls more on Gerwig than Ferrera, I feel, so that's not really a knock on the latter's performance.

Overall this was a really fun theater experience, and I'm glad Barbie is having the success it's having (even though Hollywood will undoubtedly learn all the wrong lessons from it). It's not a genius masterpiece and it's not a world-upending feminist treatise and it's far, far from perfect...and that's okay, I think. It's big and bold and just *tries* shit -- some of it works, some if it definitely doesn't, but the energy and momentum is palpable. Obviously this movie's style won't be for everyone, but I do feel its appeal is pretty broad. My second favorite movie of the year after Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.",2023-08-17
"not really sure what Mattel CEO was doing other than showing off Will Ferrell... there was no point to that subplot?

maybe to introduce Ruth.",2023-12-31
"im honestly surprised to see so many critical takes on this movie. it was definitely feminist messaging, but what exactly would you expect from a barbie movie? That being said i think people are really missing the fact that this movie isnt saying women should be in control of everything but that we as a society need to do a better job with true equality. the music, the dances, the fight scenes were genuinely well done and hilarious. the over the top and literal acting was a fun choice for a movie where the characters are meant to speak and think the way a toy would. i dont know, i really enjoyed it thought it was fun and a very unique film but i guess people are very sensitive these days if they have have a certain perception about a message whether or not that perception is accurate",2024-01-04

"This was so ridiculous and over the top. I fucking loved every second of it.

Yes the plot is a simplification of the actual issue of feminism vs patriarchy but it‚Äôs a movie made to entertain first over anything else. I loved the movie, the sets, the acting, and the message. But what do I know? I‚Äôm just Ken.",2023-08-02
"Okay, I finally saw Barbie after weeks of booked out cinemas in Australia. I'm really glad I did. 

- Firstly, I'm a *huge* Greta Gerwig fan, and while I don't think Barbie is her best movie, it certainly proves that she's a master of capturing and understanding the human condition. 

- I'm a guy, and I don't understand all the drama online about other men saying it's misandristic. The takeout for me, as a guy, was that men are raised in a world where we don't have to think twice about our place. Everything's set up for us to succeed. That leads a lot of men to follow what's expected of them, which can be unfulfilling and leave a lot of acting in a way that doesn't accord with our values. We don't have to do what's expected of a man - we can forge our own path. I found it empowering and reassuring, not offensive. 

- I really feel for Greta Gerwig, because it's clear her vision was somewhat neutered by Mattel. I get it, Barbie's one of the world's most protected brands, so there would've been some concessions to make the film happen. It definitely had no right being as good as it was, but it also felt like it was just missing that oomph to make it great. 

- I cried a lot more than I thought I would. It was really touching in parts. I really related to Alan, being the misfit kid who loved hanging with girls but was always lumped in with boys. I really liked that he felt like a nod to the ""in-between"" kids who never really felt like they fit anywhere. 

- People who say it was a weak ""girlboss"" version of feminism missed the point imo. It was supposed to be a love letter to women that acknowledges the whole of being a woman today. I don't think anybody expects Barbie to inspire a movement, but I think these messages and portrayals of women are important as a check on reality - particularly for young women who are still learning about it.",2023-08-26
"Finally saw this after hearing nothing but great things.  I will say, the actors are brilliant, barbieland is weird and compelling and looks fantastic, but I thought the screenplay in the second and third acts was so lazy and literal-minded it made me want to pull my hair out.

It‚Äôs like the filmmakers forgot that there are ways to convey complex ideas in a film without relying on expository monologue directly explaining everything for the audience. Or they didn‚Äôt trust that the audience would understand or catch on to satire unless it was explicitly explained.

Whatever happened to ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù?",2023-12-23
"The whole movie is such a lovely testament to what it means to be a woman. I feel like I have a thousand words I could say but none of them seem to be enough, but I can say thank you, Barbie. I want to give you a big hug.",2023-07-22

"I liked the movie. Barbie brings up points about toxic masculinity, toxic femininity, toxic positivity and benevolent sexism. Not every night has to be boys' or girls' night. Equality is essential in society. 

The movie explains how men and women are treated differently in society, how women have to fight to be taken seriously, and how hurtful toxic masculinity and toxic femininity are.

The moral of the movie is that everything has to have a balance. Barbie had an existential crisis and I, too, had it. This movie inspired me to get out there and chase my dreams.",2023-10-20

"I don‚Äôt get why men take away that this movie is just men=bad. I saw it as Ken having the same existential crisis as Barbie and filling it with his mojo dojo casa house and hypermasculinity. Which as someone who grew with a brother is exactly what I saw my brother go through in adolescence, his crisis made him push away every woman in his life and he was ‚Äúedgy‚Äù. I actually sympathized so much for Ken, specially because he thought his only worth was having a hot woman which is what a lot of men feel pressured to. I felt that the message was very clear men you are enough! (Or Kenough! That hoodie will be sold out in seconds!) and women are also enough! How is that idea anti-men at all? 

I loved this movie and can‚Äôt wait to rewatch. Sure, there‚Äôs themes that I think it could go deeper into, and this movie isn‚Äôt any new ideas but it was so touching and so well done! I think the old woman at the park moment, though beautiful, felt a little unearned, but I‚Äôm still glad it was done because my generation is so terrified of aging. The mother line made me tear up immediately, that scene was amazing!",2023-07-21

"I really liked it but it's script didn't seem to know how it wanted to wrap up.  I think the Kens also don't ever get a fulfilling ending. Like if the Kens are the women equivalent for Barbieland then why use patriarchal tactics (making them hate each other and then changing the literal government while they're fighting l) and then tell them the only thing they need is to ""discover themselves"". I much like the real world, its solid advice that ignore shtbereal issue (Barbieland/the patriarchy) that's making the Kens upset.",2023-07-24

Definitely think the ""man hating"" reviews are overly harsh. Yeah, there's of course quips at men and the patriarchy. But the ending message of the movie was that individualism is beautiful and no one is better or worse than anyone else because of sex characteristics you can't control. And Greta made sure that was evident of the Ken's too, making their uniqueness just as important as the Barbie's.",2023-08-04
" Movie was fine, but I saw a lot of littler kids, 5-6, looking pretty glassy eyed as I left the crowded theatre.  The parents were all gabbing excitedly while their kids looked like they had been conned into going to the dentist.",2023-08-05
"Just saw it today. Loved it. I agree the Will Ferrel parts were weird and unnecessary. 
I can also understand why conservative trolls feel so threatened by it, it's not for the weak minded.
It's a bright, fun, silly little movie for anyone who had a Barbie and treated it like gold, or played with it ""too hard"". Its also a good message, for both boys and girls, to not let your identity get lost in another person. Be Barbie and be Ken.",2023-08-17
"I loved this movie and think it may be toward the top of my list as a great film. I didn't know what I expected going in, but I was not expecting that (in the best way possible). It had the worldbuilding creativity of the Lego movie, the set design style of Wes Anderson, the metaness of Community, and the social commentary of South Park. As with the pop culture around the Barbie Doll, it intelligently (not panderingly) utilizes pop culture references including the actors themselves (specific people utilized in specific parts for great commentary, jokes, and presence). It was a fun and relatively straightforward story that managed to make some great social history commentary about the US post WW2 while also exploring the philosophies around what make us human. All while being compasionate and positive towards the groups and types of people it explores.

While it's not really a kids movie, it's an entertaining watch and they can still pick up on some core themes like ""nobodies perfect, we can all get sad and insecure, the grass isn't always greener, and empathy (treat others the way you want to be treated)."" I can definitely see some of this movie going over people's heads to varying degrees and in regards to various themes. So much was going on, I'm unsure if some stuff that I thought was commentary is me reading too much into a scene or line, but that's OK because this moving had so much depth and so many themes to explore.

If I was pressed for complaints, I would say most of the themes were outright stated (but with plenty consistency to back them up) and more than a few of the jokes were ""meh"" (but that only stood out by virtue of how good some other one off and running jokes were).

Overall, I'm ecstatic I experienced this unexpected delight today.",2023-08-19
"Saw this with my girlfriend. She wanted to see this bc of Ryan Gosling and well, that made two of us. We went into it blind, not having read anything about the film. It was entertaining, funny, smart and silly. Of course, it has its flaws but well worth the price of admission.  Not sure where all the backlash is coming from though. Perhaps just another sign of the times. Watching Barbie as a Catholic Latino who grew up on 80s action films and still enjoys Herculean muscular action, i never once thought this film is some ultra-feministic anti-men social commentary on the horrors of Western patriarchal society or whatever these people are saying.    People need to stop reading into things too much and turning everything into a political statement.",2023-08-22
"I am late to the party but I finally saw this today and I really loved it so much. My favorite moment from the film came near the end when Ruth tells Barbie ‚ÄúMothers stand still so daughters can look back and see how far they‚Äôve gone.‚Äù It‚Äôs such a beautiful thought. I cried in the theater and I really wasn‚Äôt expecting that at all from this movie.

Also, I was so impressed with the performances of Margot and Ryan. They both nailed their roles. Was Ryan‚Äôs Ken based on Jake Paul? Anyone else get that vibe?",2023-08-28
"Even though the movie didn't say anything new or unique about society, I think it did an amazing job in *how* it made those points. Ken's storyline is an amazing parable of the pipeline to becoming an incel/misogynist. The scene where Barbie and Ken reacted differently to being gawked at on the beach was deft.

Also, I think Greta Gerwig is currently the best director in cinema. Lady Bird -> Little Women -> Barbie is up there with some of the best stretches for any director.",2023-09-06
"Finally got around to watching this. It actually lived up to the hype. Looked great, the cast chews the scenery in the best possible way, and the social commentary was actually surprisingly nuanced (which some are incorrectly interpreting as inconsistency). The criticisms about the plot ring true - Will Farrells character in particular is under developed / not relevant - but it doesn‚Äôt detract from the experience much. The plot is just a vehicle for the character development of Barbie and Ken which is itself a vehicle for Gerwigs commentary in modern feminism and toxic masculinity. And ultimately it‚Äôs good enough to achieve its goals.",2023-09-17
"I went in neutral, had heard there were funny scenes but not much else.
As a (29M) I really enjoyed the film. It was uplifting and fun, didn't put anyone down but also showed how biased our world can be. 

Every ideal was just pulled from reality, and many folks who ""didn't like the movie"" seemingly can't accept that they really do portray reality at its usual, male centred bias. I find it a great eye opener and fluid way to get into discussing womens rights, along with human rights in general.

8/10 for me, it's just a giant advertisement for Barbies but does have great undertones.",2023-09-19
"Wel... I think it was a good time but I definitely don't think it's that deep of a movie or a masterpiece or anything. But I'm glad I watch it, the cast is incredible and I thought it was very funny most of the time. 7.5/10",2023-09-27

"I liked the movie, and I get the point they were trying to make and the message they were sending, but I dont think this is a big step for feminism. I can see the parellel, and I relate to a lot of the points they made, but nothing was accomplished other than making the comparison. The Barbies dont give the Kens a voice when they just went through a whole movie about how women in the real world dont have a voice. When the Kens ask to be represented in government, they are immediately shot down and told its too big of a responsibility for them. Feminism isnt about ""women and only women are in power or make all the decisions"" its literally just asking to be seen as equal. To be a part of the conversation, and not just as a notetaker/secretary. Everything went back to normal at the end in their respective worlds. If you are someone who cant relate to being left out of the conversation, who cant relate to not being considered, you would miss the point, which is why I think a lot of men didnt like the movie.",2024-01-08

Really enjoyed it. Loved the humor and set design especially. Matchbox 20 instead of Wonderwall was the correct choice. (Wonderwall is too low hanging fruit at this point). I think the biggest thing is I'm not really sure why the Mattel dudes went to Barbieland. They pretty much just yeeted from the story at that point onwards and then didn't even really seem to do much at the ending.,2023-07-25

"The movie was visually dazzling, lots of fun, and had a lot of heart but could have been better if it had been more focused. They introduced more plotlines than they could resolve, which is why they have the characters straight up describe the ending. In fact, the ending is a testament to how the film starts out *so* strong only to get weaker as it goes on. After being able to beautifully show without telling in the earlier part of the movie (like when Barbie sees the beauty of an elderly woman, or when Barbie starts picking up on an aggressive male gaze at the boardwalk), they resort to just describing feminism and patriarchy in the latter half of the movie. 

With that being said, the movie was so visually striking and fun that I adored it despite its flaws.",2023-08-03

"Why do people say that Barbie is overwhelmingly a kids movie? I was reading some reviews of the movie, and I saw some people defending some aspects of the movie saying that it‚Äôs supposed to be a kids movie, but I disagree. I mean yeah, barbie is a toy for kids and a kid could watch this movie, but I feel like it‚Äôs deflecting criticism by saying it‚Äôs a ‚Äúkids‚Äù movie. I feel like the ideas were made to appeal to older people satirizing Barbie rather than solely appealing to children. Also, a decent amount of the jokes, messages, innuendos, etc. would not be comprehensible to kids. Am I missing something or is it intended for adults? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one of those things where they add in some jokes for adults watching with their kids, either, it‚Äôs too common for that.",2023-07-26

"i‚Äôm no big film expert or anything like that, but I just finished watching the Barbie movie and had a blast!! :)

went into it with quite low expectations but it really surprised me. some moments made me audibly laugh and i needed that a lot. some parts made me cry (3 times to be exact) and some parts were slightly cringey (but tolerable). it was a very heartwarming and refreshing movie, and it completely surpassed my expectations for it being a film about a doll. and seriously, the kens played their part well!!

i‚Äôm an 18 year old girl, and barbie made quite an impact on me! it made me think of my own mum in a different light ‚Äî and other women in general too. i‚Äôd love to watch it again soon :D",2023-08-06

"I really loved Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in this movie.  Those two absolutely stole the show in my opinion they just played their roles amazingly.  I actually think that Barbie felt a little underdeveloped for where she ended up as.  I just really didnt like the mom and daughter.  The daughter's first line made me eyeroll and the mom had some sweet moments, but her saving by talkinh about the ""real world"" and the whole patriarchy plot felt bleh.  I don't hate these ideas at all and in a barbie movie could be explored really thouroughly, but it just felt forced and too on the nose to where it felt kind of pretensious.  You could automatically read where the mom and daughter were gonna end up the moment you meet them and they just seemed so predictable and don't capitalize in their moments to make me feel for them by seeming pretensious.  There's no subtlety at all and it hurts because Barbies development is tied to them.  Barbie was actually amazing in this.  The scene where she was sitting on the bench, when she was in the kitchen, and her final couple scence were amazing, but it got sidelined for a dumb plot.

Despite being harsh, again Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors.  The set design is dropdesd gorgeous and genius.  It was actually pretty funny at moments, and the concept is cool.  Also I feel like Allen shouldve bonded with that one desk guy.  Like idk what was the point of Allen in the end.  He was really just there for no reason, and the idea that he could represent the struggling class of people was RIGHT there.",2023-07-23

The Barbies' have a mundane and monotonous society that oppresses an entire half of their population.

When the Barbies' restore their oppressive system they force the ken's to have a menial and powerless lower court judge position, refusing to give them equality. It literally makes it out that a society created and ruled by women would be horrible.

"I didn't have high hopes for this movie. But I just came out of the cinema, and I've got to say: this movie is so smart on so many levels! It's really all about what it means to be human. It's about our fantasies and projections. It's about societal expectations and peer pressure. It's about mortality and transience. There are so many levels to it. 

The reference to *2001: A Space Odyssey* at the beginning sets the movie up in that way, and the rest of the movie keeps delivering on that. 

I was so happy to see Rhea Perlman. It didn't know she'd be in it. The scenes with her kind of blew my mind. I kept thinking about Carla from *Cheers*. 

I lost it when Ken says ""I won a Nobel Prize in horses."" I needed that laugh so bad. 

The fact that the movie in part functions as a big advertisement for Mattel bothers me. But that's certainly not all that the movie is.

The pink everywhere and the pop music and the dancing, that stuff is not my aesthetic at all. I loved this movie *despite* all of that.

It just had an angrier/more depressed vibe than I was expecting.  I found myself feeling more empathy for Ken than Barbie (and I don't think that's what this movie intended). He was kind of a jerk but he just wanted to be noticed and loved. 

Also, I was very curious as to how Ken was able to brainwash all the Barbies. I was hoping we'd get to see what happened with Ken once he'd returned to BarbieLand.",2023-12-19

"I figured Barbie would be a fun watch but I didn‚Äôt expect to love it as much as I did.  It perfectly toed the line between making fun of Barbie and honoring Barbie.  In order to poke fun at something you need to know it inside and out and the writers did their homework!  All the specific dolls/outfits, how Barbies bend, brushes that don‚Äôt actually brush their hair, those little white twist ties holding them in the box-they got every little specific detail right!
 

I thought it was so clever that in the end the Barbie world remains matriarchal but throws a few concessions to the Kens mirroring the real world where the world remains patriarchal but has essentially thrown a few concessions to women.  


I also appreciated the acknowledgement Robbie was playing ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù Barbie and that there were lots of different women represented as Barbies in Barbieworld.  As Robbie was crying about feeling bad and unpretty I was about to roll my eyes before Mirren cuts in with the perfect 4th wall break about how Robbie isn‚Äôt the ideal casting choice to deliver this line.  Perfect!  Similar to when the girls at lunch are just like ‚Äúyou are an unrealistic standard.  I mean just look at you!‚Äù  It just felt like every time the writers were about to fall in a trap they wrote themselves out of it.  Even having the mother being the one in need of Barbie rather than the daughter was brilliant!

"Okay, so everyone and their mother has thoughts on Barbie, so instead of talking about how awesome of a movie it is generally, I want to focus on this notion that it's ""anti-men"".

Sure, they definitely poke fun at masculine stereotypes but lest we forget the ENTIRE MOVIE also calls out the impossible feminine standards set by Barbie herself. It is dissecting the very concept of gender and its implications on society. Men are in a constant war to dominate each other, while women are being held to extreme standards set by both men AND other women. It's a hyperbolic and satirical take on gender conflict.

But the end has perhaps one of the best ""be yourself"" lessons ever, because both Barbie and Ken realize they're more than the roles set out for them. They manage to find purpose and agency where before they were just acting out a play.

Barbie is a person. 

Ken is Kenough.

Being yourself matters more than whatever society thinks of you.

Banger movie, I will buy MATTEL PRODUCT‚Ñ¢!",2023-07-29
"Barbieland is our girlhood ‚Äî when we are naive about the world and honestly believe we can be ‚Äúwhatever we want to be.‚Äù  Many girls are zapped into the ‚ÄúReal World‚Äù when we encounter the male gaze as soon as we approach puberty.  I was 12 when I started getting harassed by grown men at the bus stop.  Yes, violent threats were commonplace. 

Barbieland *is* a matriarchy, but the Kens are not objectified, nor pushed into servitude ‚Äî they just coexist with the Barbies but are still accessories to the Barbies with no real agency or identity of their own. 

Transitioning to the Real World is like the coming of age for many girls (and boys). Barbie instantly feels objectified with ‚Äúan undercurrent of violence‚Äù but Ken is discovering he, simply for being a man, is at the top of the power pyramid. 

When Ken comes back, he institutes a learned patriarchy in a zero sum manner. It‚Äôs not enough to just run off with the Kens and start their own society, but they do so at the expense of the Barbies. They take their homes, their cars, and push them into a hierarchical servitude. 

When Barbie comes back and teams up with the other Barbies to correct the patriarchy, she implores Ken to find meaning as Ken, not just as an accessory to Barbie. She acknowledges the matriarchy wasn‚Äôt fair either.  She wants him to live out his own purpose, to have agency ‚Äî even after everything he did.  Ken isn‚Äôt evil, and the Barbies aren‚Äôt man-haters but the Kens fell victim to patriarchy too as men. 

When Ruth, Barbie‚Äôs mom, takes Barbie‚Äôs hand and walks off to have a private conversation with her, this scene to me symbolizes the special relationship mothers can have with their daughters. 

We as mothers know the hurt that is our society and how it treats women, especially women who haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúbroken‚Äù by the patriarchy yet ‚Äî but we cannot bear ourselves to be *complete* cynics to our young daughters. We do not abandon the idea of the utopia in the hopes that one day our daughters way down the line might finally reap the seeds we have been planting for millennia. 

The montage of women at the end, represent the countless women who have come before us, bore the even harsher, base realities of patriarchy, yet still, collectively, have kept the sisterhood alive. 

The very last scene is made to be like typical close out scenes ‚Äî aspirational and gearing you up for a real feel good ending. 

Barbie chose to live in the Real World, despite a guaranteed troubled existence. She chose to ‚Äúhave ideas‚Äù and make a difference rather than continue living life as an object. Many women have this radicalizing moment themselves in their own lives ‚Äî dare I say, when we get ‚Äúwoke‚Äù to patriarchy and the stupid fucking glass ceiling. 

She becomes the ordinary woman, heading to her gynecologist appointment ‚Äî a completely mundane activity. 

She‚Äôs *just* a woman and that is just fine.",2023-08-07

Not to mention the inclusion of Allan at all was there to illustrate not all men subscribe to patriarchal views.

Did it spend a lot of time ribbing patriarchal structures? 100%. Did it also point out that matriarchy is hypocritical and misandry isn't the answer? Yes. Pretty overtly.",2023-07-26
"The Barbie movie really blew away my expectations from the start. I knew there would be darker and lighter themes, but the trailers and initial parts of the film made it seem like it would be about Barbie, the perfect fantasy superheroine-of-femininity helping a struggling girl with her problems, but the movie then does a 180 turnaround and says ""screw that!"" and focuses on the two normal humans helping Barbie with her problems!   
  
Barbie's ultra-feminist matriarcal utopia ideal is torn down harder than the baby dolls were satirically at the start of the movie where they declared ""and then gender role problems were SOLVED FOREVER! Yay!"" in a move that brought to mind that infamous ""Pepsi is the solution to all conflict"" commercial.   
  
Firstly by reality, where it's harshly criticized that her impossible standards feel like just another way society pressures women to meet expectations that cannot be met.   
  
But then also by Ken, who we see has his feelings dismissed as unimportant and who doesn't know how to have self-confidence without tying it to someone else. He's surprisingly interesting to me in how he's framed as the antagonist, but you can clearly see he's just someone who felt rejected and disrespected and unimportant, only to find all these books in the ""Real World"" about Patriarchy, and how if you just DO THAT, you'll get all the respect and importance and women you could ever desire.   
  
So he does, turning Barbie Land into dudebro land and flipping the entire hierarchy upside-down. The Barbies fighting to take things back by underhanded emotional manipulation of their fragile masculinity.   
  
It works, but the scene after is WHY it works. Yes, we've played with the idea of Barbie and deconstructing its interaction with gender roles with all the subtlety of a plastic hammer, but what's the RESOLUTION? Ken is crying on Barbie's bed, venting to her about how he felt disrespected, unappreciated, and felt the need to constantly fight for her attention because he didn't know who he was without her. And she listens, and apologizes for how she made him feel.   
  
Because this movie isn't about a plastic perfect personification of feminism going to the real world and fixing a depressed woman's body issues. This movie isn't about Barbie and her fellow girlbosses overthrowing the Patriarchy and restoring Barbieland to ""How it's supposed to be.""  
  
It's a movie about people who feel disrespected and underappreciated. About people who see ideas about ""who they should be"" and try to cram themselves into that mold because then they will get the love or attention or respect they crave more than anything in the world. It's not about trying to be perfect, but recognizing that we can be better. Not with hair extensions or makeup, or working out and acting macho, but with telling someone ""you look nice today"" or ""your feelings are valid."" Being there for each other but also for ourselves.",2023-07-26
"What made the whole story click together for me

I loved the movie on the first watch because of all the on-the-nose validating moments, on the second I wanted to understand all the intentional elements. Like many people I saw the individual pieces but couldn't make sense of the whole picture, it took half the walk home to get to where I am now. I empathize with some comments saying things felt too spelled out and disjointed. What ended up pulling it together for me was what Will Ferrell's character emphasised, that Barbieland at its core is what fuels the hopes and dreams of young girls. It isn't a reflection of a better world or a world run by women, just a young girl's internal world, like many of ours', spearheaded by Barbie.

Something I battled with was why was it ok the Barbies to overthrow Kens back for a system that favors one side way more when that's theoretically just the problem of patriarchy in reverse. But it makes sense with Barbieland being the home of young girls' minds and dreams needing to be maintained. Waking the Barbies from ""brainwashing"" supported young girls' dreams centering their personal missions, not their kens'. It made the touch of maid outfits so appropriate.

And when the Kens took over, it was only a manly surface decoration over the pink dream houses. It was a girl's internal world smothered by the image of men, it isn‚Äôt foundationally a boy's world or neutral land. It‚Äôs stolen land which is why the barbies were justified in taking it back, hence the smallpox reference. The Barbies taking back Barbieland wasn't for just their own comfort, but to defend the real world girls' self-image feuled by Mattel‚Äôs toys. The established Barbie image is far from perfect as the movie insinuates, but it was definitely essential that the ideas of powerful girly women not be completely eradicated by romantisised patriarchy in the world of young girls.

Ken‚Äôs version of patriarchy looked so goofy and couldnt work in the real world because it's what a girl‚Äôs mind thinks having patriarchy work for them looks like. The idea that an easy romantic life waits for girls if they're dumber, skimpier, obedient, and following confident cowboy men. The Kens and Barbies both lived so absurdly happy in either version because Barbieland is founded on young girls imagining their lives as harmoniously perfect. The tempting ideas of patriarchy can fit right into that. The issue as a whole only started to break down with the exposure and acceptance of being sad, weird, and imperfect via Barbie's journey, outcast Barbies, and the humans. Patriarchy was just another vessel for Barbieland to see the flaws of blindly following perfection, triggered by the point of monologue. It starts the whole discussion for change and acknowledges the flaws of barbieland including treatment of ken and other babies.

Oh and Kens turn on Barbie really is really a show of how our perception of men when we are young can betray us once we go into the real world.

This was an adhd barf. Hope people can relate to this, it's how everything from the movie came together for me. These were some of my connections, but after reframing it in this way made many small details fall into place and now I think this story is incredibly well thought out and is a personal love of mine.

In hindsight, Brabieland being the materialization of girlhood was constantly iterated by how Barbie was linked to Gloria, the toys changing in the real world, and Will Ferrell's obsession with keeping the balance, but I guess that just didn't click for me as I was watching. It made sense of why the Kens were as nonessencial as they were, why they had to lose their power, the role of Gloria and the outcasts, and why Babrieland had to change in the end. Now I really get all those saying ‚Äúit isn't for you‚Äù, because it only tackles men through the perspective of vulnerable fantasy girlhood. In fact it barely addresses real world men, and the fleeting moments that do are quite humanising.",2023-08-06

"Saw it last night... and I'm still confused this morning. The first half was utterly amazing. Wonderful, surreal, hilarious. And then... I don't know. It just started to lose it's way. There was still some great stuff in there, but it wasn't firing on all cylinders any more.

While I loved the monologue, there were some bits after that where I felt like they were hitting me over the head with ""the message"" (when at the start it was wonderfully interwoven and comically done). Ken's character arc was more eventful and interesting than Barbie's when you really boil it down, and yet his revelations at the end were just dismissed, while Barbie's ending... urgh. I know people will disagree with me here, so I'm waiting for the downvotes, but having her choose to go to the real world felt really wrong! 

I loved when she and Ken went there he was having a great time and she was trying to describe strange feelings - automatic feelings - that she'd never had before, like anxiety, fear  etc. (Interestingly my husband didn't get this at all and I had to explain how most/all women genuinely do feel like that most of the time. He looked a bit shocked). Then the daughter telling her everyone hates Barbie and what she represents (that would have been me btw, I hated Barbie when I was young for all the reasons she says!). It's clear the real world is the real world we know - a hard place for women. But at the end when she says she'd like to go live in the real world, it's never really explained why she would want to, and then Ruth says she can't in good conscience let her go without showing her what it's really like... before filling her head with ""female perfection"" - all laughter and sunshine and happy families. That's not what it's really like. Ruth conned her! Given the subversive nature of the rest of the film I expected Ruth to show her what it was really like - periods, pregnancy, abortion issues, lower wages, abuse, sexism, healthcare, menopause - and for Barbie to say you know what? No thanks. I'll stay where I am and keep improving Barbieland. Like the scene with Weird Barbie (who I \*loved\*) and the shoes. The fact it ended with her in a GYN's office just felt like a bad joke, and I didn't know if it was meant to be a bad joke - haha Barbie you think the real world is so great, welcome to the hell that is being a woman. 

I think the film was trying to show that a matriarchy can be just as bad as a patriarchy, and it did that really well at the beginning, but not well at the end. I suspect that was intentional, but it ended up being messy and vague. 

And lastly, I knew nothing about the history of Barbie before seeing this film, but I read a couple of articles beforehand and had a newfound respect for the doll because other dolls were babies to made girls want to be mothers (like the film hilariously points out), and Barbie never had kids because she's supposed to be whatever she wants to be. While I never realised  before, and which I really liked! But then Gloria's big idea was to make an ""everyday Barbie"" who was a mum. And Ruth showed Barbie ""happy family"" type images. Why not show happy women doing other things? Their own things? Isn't that what Barbie was supposed to be? I found that message pretty disappointing.

What I will say though... Ryan Gosling was having a blast making that movie!",2023-08-07

"Greta Gerwig, we simply do not deserve you. 

I'm so happy to say that after having huge expectations for this movie that I was still blown away by how hilarious it is and how deeply connected to the human experience it feels. 

I loved the dream world of Barbie and every single performance going on there, usually when a movie like this goes to the ""real world"" that's when it starts to go downhill, but not Barbie. Robbie perfectly embodies the abstract concept of the stereotypical Barbie, but when her consciousness gets flipped on and she goes to the real world she has some incredible scenes. I loved how when her and Ken first arrive, she's met with anxiety and seemingly violent aggression, whereas Ken picks up right away that this world was made for him and he feels absolutely none of that. 

It's moments like that that make Barbie truly one of the most interesting and intelligent social commentaries we've gotten in such a big budget. The thematic implications of this movie are insane, and it doesn't feel like they're brought up and brushed aside but rather that Gerwig is using the beautiful artifice of Barbie to really dig into them. It's kind of wild that Mattel even let her go this hard, not just on the themes of social expectation, but also kind of calling them out for being run by businessmen? Will Ferrell being the funniest he's been in years here.

This movie is so much more than a brilliant exploration of feminism and feminiminity. It's about the whole human experience. It's about the difference between what young girls and young boys read about the world and their place in it, it's about our connection to our toys and what plastic models can mean to developing minds, it's about male insecurity and how men are so starved for validation that someone asking them what time it is makes them feel like a king, it's about how men and women interact with each other and how society is so demanding that they pair up, it's about the changing ideas of what feminism or progressivism means now vs then, it's about patriarchy and business ethics and seemingly every feeling that we as people have on a day to day basis. It's about everything.

The plot is exactly what it needs to be to convey all these things. When the mother/daughter plotline got involved I thought maybe this was going to be more tropey than I thought, but it really continued to surprise me at every turn. They weren't there to distract the movie or shove in a kid character, them and Barbie each represented different evolutions of feminism.

America's speech at the end about how criticized women are and how much is expected of them to walk this perfect line between independence and femininity was insanely well written and acted, if this movie just had that to say it would have been great, but there was so much more to this. Really something for everybody here, this isn't just for girls or women but for anybody who experiences the mess of feelings and desires that it is to be human. 

I just fucking loved this. It had me thinking the entire time, but also getting some of the biggest laughs this year in moments like when every Ken was singing Push by Matchbox 20 or every single hilarious thing Gosling did and said. This is an easy 9/10 and it could go higher on rewatches. This will absolutely be my new comfort movie when it comes out on blu ray.

"When the authoritarian power structure fractured the minority groups to literally fistfight among themselves while they undemocratically changed the constitution...  

Solid 4/5.  I want to see the version without Matell's permission.  Ferrell famously did a version of ""one for them, one for you"" in Letterman's last week (maybe) and I kept thinking about it in terms of Gerwig.  ""I can make any movie I want now.""  She winks at the audience the whole time and the biggest punches were the most subtle.  

I mean at the end of the movie, the girls all win, the status quo is returned; and Barbie frowns.  The Harry Potter reference is obvious but it's pulling from a big well.  It made me think of Carlin as Rufus and *Neverending Story* as well.  Perlman is perfect casting.

"So I've read a lot of comments about how the Barbie's should have done better and given equal opportunity to the Kens. And you know what no.

When the dialogue happened where they weren't given a a seat on the supreme Court I felt a tinge of ""this isn't right, they should do better and do the right thing"". I even thought ""but the kens are so simple minded they couldn't possibly handle that"" and then I realized..... This is how men have viewed women forever. So yes the Ken's should get a seat just as women in the real world should get a full seat..... But. But we haven't. We've started to but we haven't. And the barbie world is a reflection of the real world in inverse so when the men in our world shape up the Barbies will. 

As for the people saying the Barbies should lead by example... There's a saying from the bible people like to quote ""do unto others"" that frankly I think gets hammered into women more than men. At least on gendered issues. Cause historically men haven't followed it where women are concerned. And why should the Barbies start change.... Their society is relatively new compared to the real world oppression of women. You're just expecting us to be polite and civil like you have basically enslaved us to be for thousands of years. It's on men to start change now. I don't think that's unfair.

As for the people not liking how the Barbie's manipulated the Ken's into fighting each other.... Tough fucking shit. They brainwashed, enslaved, and made the Barbie's homeless with no rights. All's fair in that scenario. Yes it's bad to manipulate a romantic partner that way but if that's the stakes.... Have at 'er.

Otherwise I enjoyed the movie and literally laughed more than I ever had in a theatre.",2023-08-29
"Am I being sexist, or does the matriarchy of barbieland treat the kens as bad if not worse than the real world treats women? I am genuinely asking.

I will make this clear: I am a male. I do not want to start something awful, and I do not want to be perceived as some hateful bigot. I like the movie, it was fun and had a lot of great points about the unfair double standards women have to weave through in the patriarchal society we live in. But there's a line in the movie that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

When Barbie returns to barbieland with the mom and her daughter, she shows her around the dreamhouses and says that every Barbie lives in one of the dreamhouses. But when the mom asks where the kens stay, Barbie has no idea. That got me thinking; what do the kens even do?

No seriously, what are they allowed to do? What are they allowed to own? They don't have houses, they don't have cars, they don't even have real jobs, the only exception being lifeguard Ken to my memory. They just do things that most people would only have as either a hobby or athletic career. The only thing that they do to contribute to the Barbies is just stand aside and look nice.

I know how all this sounds, and I know that as a man I have no ground to stand on for a film about feminism. But they play up Barbie land as being something better than reality when all honesty, it just looks like the gender-band version of what we have today. Or more accurately, what we had 50 years ago. A world where one sex controls the world, and the other is just seen as an accessory.

"I think that this is the first time a massive tentpole movie has been directed at adult women.  There are other very female movies like Legally Blonde and there are Disney Princess movies aimed at little girls, but this is the first event on par with superhero movies aimed at grown women.  Female driven comic book movies can be great, but they still come from a male world.  Barbie was created by a woman and her audience has generally been little girls.  The weird joy of seeing Barbie you played with as a child onscreen only exists for those who played with them.  I wasn't even super into Barbie as a kid, but I legit squealed seeing a few specific ones onscreen. 

Greta Gerwig is a woman who grew up in America and thus, inevitably played with Barbies.  That is how you get the very real Weird Barbie.  It is also how you get Barbie floating out of her house.  That is how girls play.  And no, no one thinks about where Ken lives or what he does when he is not squiring Barbie around.  Maybe young boys will become more drawn to Ken and he will develop his own less toxic masculine world, but as it stands now he is a supporting character.

Greta Gerwig is also a mother who made a whole movie about difficult teenage girls.  A lot of other filmmakers would have made the central human character Sasha, but Gloria is the central human here.  She's the one who calls Barbie to the real world and her struggles help the Barbies snap out of patriarchy.  Centering a woman rather than a girl really changes the tone of the movie.

Greta Gerwig is also an elder millennial and you get a lot of references to that with depression watching Pride and Prejudice and the Kens singing Matchbox Twenty at the Barbies.  

There is a critique of maleness here and I understand how that makes some guys uncomfortable.  But I genuinely laughed when they distracted Ken by asking him to explain The Godfather because that is a real thing!

It is not the be all end all of feminist representation.  It is simplistic in a lot of ways.  As /u/pinkpugita pointed out, it is easy for Barbie to choose the real world when that means being a beautiful, privileged woman instead of working in a sweatshop in the developing world.  The movie is very American.  But putting the word patriarchy at the center of a tentpole movie is still bold.",2023-07-24

My second comment on the film now that the internet is still raging on about this movie and it's evilness or something.


The movie isn't anti-men or anti-women. It's anti modern day society's expectations for both and the message everyone should get from it is that being yourself is all you need to have value. 


Ken isn't being used as a prop to direct manhate on. His two arcs in chasing barbie's approval and then the Patriarchy are used to mock how ridiculous society's pressures on modern men are. Men are increasingly shamed and mocked for having no value if they are single these days and this movie addresses this in comedic fashion by mocking the ridiculous things they do and the lack of self-respect the Kens have for themselves in blindly chasing a woman for no apparent reason beyond it's their programming. And then the patriarchy stuff mocks the growing sentiment that men these days need to be more alpha and dominant by showing how utterly stupid it is in an entertaining manner. 


Similarly,the growing sentiment that women don't need men cuz girl power which ends up directing hate towards men is mocked with the oppressive matriarchy of Barbieworld. The ''heroes'' winning in the end doesn't feel remotely heroic cuz of how it's the exact same as the Kendom and only now decided to make some progress to reduce inequality. And the pressures Barbie faces in the movie first with her physical imperfections and then with uber progressive daughter mock other pressures women face nowadays. One that they need to look perfect at all times and the other that individual women have an unfeasible holy mission to solve the injustices and inequalities of the world or else they betray their sex. Former is mocked with the hilarious quip about how Margot Robbie isn't a good choice for talking about how ugly she is and the latter with the bit where the daughter blurts out that Barbie is a white saviour and calling her a fascist to show that people will never be satisfied and look to find hate and problems in anything. 


Both Ken and Barbie end the movie happy and with the discovery that just being themselves is what makes them happy. 


It's rare that we get a movie that gives positive messages for both guys and girls whilst tackling specific modern issues let alone a big and successful one which is also super fun like this one. People are too deadset in their ways by finding ways to be miserable and offended by this film which just shows that they are refusing to let go of their ideology in this weird cultural war that's waged today. People just need to have fun and be themselves!",2023-07-27

"There's such an energy around this movie! Not just on screen but around it too. It's so much fun going to a theatre and people are dressed up in pink, having a good time. Films are back baby! And I love when people can rally about a movie that is 'actually good' tm (c) !!!

And this is actually good! For real! 

One part ELF, one part Pleasantville, throw in some lego movie and then sprinkle some pink on it and we've got a good fucking time. Really silly and self aware, and brave in a lot of ways. It's not afraid to make fun of itself and kudos to Mattel for being a brand brave enough to face their criticisms head on (even if overall, it's a commercial for the doll and the new direction they're heading towards). I think it has an incredible message about female empowerment and living life on your own terms, not the way our male centric society decides you too. BUT, also it's speaking to men and it's trying to bridge the gap between our genders and foster some understanding, for everyone. I think some people will see this as vessel to make fun of men but these people are dumb lol. It's okay be poked fun of guys, just like it's still okay to like horses. They're very manly, very cool. I found the whole concept of  Ken going to the real world and seeing how much men control and getting a bit power hungry because of that so smart. It's a really clever plot device to bring some conflict into the movie. 

From a filmmaking standpoint I was most impressed with the art direction, obviously! The sets and costumes are incredible and I'm sure were a labour of love. Just give the movie all the oscars in that regard. Huge achievement and just nailed the look of a larger than life Barbie world. I was also impressed with the music, lot of jams and the movie is like pretty much a musical at times? And a good one at that. 

I think the whole cast was great, Michael Cera as Alan killed! Margot Robbie was exceptional in the title role. BUT, Gosling steals the show here. His character could've been really over the top and not in a good way.It's a really fine line and Gosling just handles it perfectly. An iconic comedic performance and one that will just shut up any doubter that he wasn't right for this role. The dude kills it and I'm so proud he's Canadian! It is a little ironic that a film about Barbie and female empowerment is a little overshadowed at times by his performance. I feel a little conflicted about this, but you can't deny that he's probably the best thing about this movie. That Just Ken song rips. 

I think the movie is at its best when it's slowed down and introspective. When we see Barbie take a moment to just experience life and her new feelings, It's very beautiful. The movie doesn't work for me in the moments it's trying to be a Chevrolet commercial (yes you read that right, the most forced product placement in a movie about a product). I also understand the mother and daughter's purpose in the plot of the film. BUT, I just felt them tacked on and unneeded and the daughter  was not a particularly good actress painful to say. The Mattel executives too felt like an after thought and not very important or funny (sorry Will Ferrell ). 

LOTS to talk about and I'll get even more from subsequent viewings. I think this movie really speaks to women and I love that. People are so stoked on this and I had a blast too. While not an exactly original IP, it is an original story and the studios need to see that good, unique films get people excited. Let's fucking gooooo.",2023-07-22

My main critiques would be that some parts did feel very on-the-nose, especially that speech about the plight of women. It felt very forced, like they were trying to spoon-feed the ""social commentary"" that had already been conveyed in more creative ways throughout.

The ending also fell a little flat for me -- I wasn't convinced why Barbie needed to leave the restored Barbieland and live in the real-world. My guess is that they are setting it up for a sequel.",2023-07-24
"Overall I think the movie was good with some heavy-handed themes and messages but that doesn't diminish the movie at all.   
I think the ending would have been far better if it had stuck to one concise message. Instead it jumped around to a message about >!Ken being his own person, then toxic masculinity, then it cut to the Mattel CEO and he said something (I forgot what he said to be honest since he really added nothing to the scene), to President Barbie saying that the world needs to change, then to President Barbie saying that the Kens still aren't going to be given any positions of power in the movie, and finally to Barbie wanting to become human!<. I personally just think that instead of addressing 5 to 6 messages half-heartedly the movie should have stuck to 1 or 2 that it could have addressed fully and thoroughly. 

>!I also think it's very weird that Barbie is so invested in saving the Barbie world from the Patriarchy but then goes into the real world where there is a far more oppressive and serious patriarchy. Maybe if there was a line about her wanting to go to the real world to empower women it would have made more sense. !<",2023-07-24

Give Magic Earring Ken his cockring necklace back you COWARDS,2023-07-30
"I loved this movie, I enjoyed it so much: it was funny and poignant and joyful.   

One of the things I appreciate the most is on the meta level: the sense of sisterhood sparked by the movie. Starting from the people dressing in pink, to reminiscing the happiness we felt when we were little girls and played with Barbie, each of us sharing childhood memories (our favorite Barbie, the family members who bought them for us). And the deep conversations we had with the other girls about femininity, our struggles, yes, and the unfairness, but also the things we love and enjoy about being ""ordinary Barbies""!  

I could feel a sense of community arising from sharing experiences and thoughts, and it was honestly a great experience.",2023-07-30
"I have to say. Ryan Gosling is the greatest thing from this movie. He arguably goes through more character growth and has an even bigger existential crisis than Barbie


He helped Kens rise & when the Barbies tried to turn them against each other, I'm glad the Ken's proved that they're above petty squabbles even though it doesn't happen IRL. The Ken's won this film for me. 

I also want those Ken Songs like RIGHT NOW. They we're just Great. It was Kenough for me",2023-07-30
"I‚Äôve been really trying hard to imagine getting mad at this film and it‚Äôs just not happening for me.

Was a fun time, my girlfriend loved it. I think it got a bit messy towards the end but Robbie and Gosling were great throughout. I do like the joke that ‚Äòthe Ken‚Äôs eventually got the power women have in the real world‚Äô - if you‚Äôre getting upset about that line then think about why?",2023-07-31
I **just** realized that the high-heel vs. slipper gag from Kate Mckinnon's character is a pretty on the nose allusion to the red vs. blue pill from the Matrix. Pretty pertinent considering the rest of the film's themes. Don't know how my dumbass didn't pick up on it sooner lmao,2023-07-31
The GM product placement was so egregious that there were times it literally felt like watching a car commercial.,2023-08-01
"I live in Europe (Germany to be precise) and when Will Ferrel's character was asked if BarbieLand is an alternate dimension or imaginary world, and he says ""both, like some Swedish town"", the audiences groaned loudly, it was soooo funny to have that meta reference of everything outside the US perceived as being some alternate reality.

I liked how not only the feminism, capitalism, etc allegories were implemented, but also how popular internet jokes like these were nicely scattered throughout the movie. The silliness and pop culture references (snydercut, duolingo lessons, etc) were my favourite part.",2023-08-02
My favorite part is when they ask where Ken lives! That's a great question. Where doo Ken's live? In Barbies basement? Standing on the beach? Where?,2023-08-06
"I think there‚Äôs layered themes to this movie that need unpacking almost like all the different worlds Barbie has to pass through before entering into the real world. Though all the themes are just conveying a singular message: It is only when we stop defining ourselves by others (ill intent or well intent) that we can allow ourselves to live. These definitions become a box that suffocates us. What is explored in this movie are all the ‚Äúothers‚Äù that exist in a modern societies. 

The most powerful one, the last one addressed in the movie (the firsts being matriarchy, feminism, and patriarchy) is how we are being defined by our parents (the dad represented by the CEO and the mom represented by Ruth). While the dad, somewhat simplistic but well intended, by just wanting their daughter to fall in love as their ending‚Ä¶it is until we are released by that can Barbie live. That was the Dads idea and definition of Barbie. The mom, represented by Ruth is to allow Barbie be who she is, something more than an idea, and it is only when she wants to outgrow that that she becomes human.


Barbie is defined by Mattel and the stories it provided to sell toys. Though well intended, we realize that it is a box that Barbie can no longer fit into.",2023-08-19
"Is it just me or anyone fell that the story line of Ken showed way more depth, change and growth.

I.meqn I felt that batbiendidnt really grow throughout the movie, the growth sort of had to be explained to her by the founder.

Meanwhile, Ken went through so much more change and in the end he realized what he always knew but just didn't want to face.",2023-08-29
"This film was kind of a mess but there were definitely some good parts. The scene where Barbie attunes to the world around her and tells the old woman she's beautiful made me tear up for some reason, totally caught me off guard. I think the first half of the film was pretty great, but it took a huge nosedive once Barbie escaped from Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were both really good. Overall I'd give it a 6/10.",2023-09-08
"Liked it but kind of gets muddled in the last third. The Barbies seem just as happy being maids as they are holding office, which makes them seem dumber than Gerwig intended. Gloria's deprogramming speech is a weird one because the Barbies have no real frame of reference for what she's talking about. The struggle she talks about is \*her\* struggle in \*her\* world, but it doesn't mean anything to them. Unless you think about Barbieland, or this version of it, being Gloria's 'creation'.

&#x200B;

I think my favourite scene is where Barbie first gets to the real world and sits on the bench. Robbie does a great job of showing Barbie experiencing all this emotion for the first time from seeing the couple laughing to seeing someone just looking sad and telling that old lady that she's beautiful. Despite it being called Barbie it doesn't really give her that much to work with (You can argue Gosling has the clearer arc) but the few grace notes she gets she kills it.",2023-09-21
"Film shows that superficial knowledge of patriarchy leads people to stupid actions. I like that. But I think most of ""women's"" problems wich we hear when Margo and others try to help ""zombified"" girls are ""men's"" problems too. Almost all stuff except motherhood concerns all modern people. Also idea that human is important in itself is very infantile. You have to do a lot to be important",2023-10-08
"I just saw movie with my wife. Im like mid 30s so this isnt my movie at all. And it was fine i guess, silly movie. But i duno, i was quite emotional near the end, thinking about my daughters and how tough its going to be for them. I dunno.",2023-10-14
"I liked it a lot. I'm surprised that there is controversy around it, but I guess people just didn't like that Ken didn't get the girl in the end and took some things too literally.",2023-11-24
"Watched the movie last night, and my personal takeaway is that the Internet simply has not been normal about it. It‚Äôs a good movie with gorgeous coloring and some very well-done emotional moments (the old woman at the bus stop, the entire mother-daughter arc, the ending with Ruth). Is it corny and on-the-nose? Well, yes. Is it some pinnacle of feminist thought? No. I didn‚Äôt love America‚Äôs speech when I first saw it, but it makes sense in context because her character is very sympathetic imo. I wasn‚Äôt all that floored by Ryan‚Äôs acting and thought Margot was much more memorable. Some of the outrage about how it‚Äôs a slight against feminism not to nominate her or Greta is, uh, interesting. The TikToks I‚Äôve seen reinforce my belief that this generation really struggles with critical media analysis without using online buzzwords. Ultimately, I think it‚Äôs a good movie about girlhood, and the fact that such a corny pastel wonderland got made and then became the biggest film of the year IS a great statement for girls to hear. 

A lot of people have criticized it for providing a simplistic definition of feminism, which, uh, yes? Were you seriously expecting capitalist critique and intersectionality from a movie about a doll? Not every piece of feminist media has to include the maximum amount of nuance. The script was filled with self-aware jokes about how problematic the character of Barbie inherently is (for example, the kid called Barbie a white savior only to be corrected). That‚Äôs about the most intersectionality you can expect from a MOVIE ABOUT BARBIE. I just don‚Äôt think that is relevant critique at all when the movie never claimed to reflect the experience of EVERY woman. At the end of the movie, America suggests a Barbie doll that will represent the average woman who is content with her life but still struggles day-to-day. That‚Äôs basically who the movie is directed towards. There is room in pop culture for a movie like that which does not delve into the struggles of every marginalized group. Barbie covers only one aspect of the female experience, and that‚Äôs okay. 

Finally, Mattel‚Äôs storyline is indeed half-baked, but the movie‚Äôs self-awareness kind of makes up for it. They still mock Mattel until the very end. Is it ironic that this movie is also essentially a commercial for Mattel‚Äôs products? Well, yes. Expecting capitalist critique (beyond lighthearted satire) is also asinine. You‚Äôd be surprised by how few offline people would want to see capitalism criticized anyway. All in all, that part of the story could‚Äôve been done better or excluded altogether, because I don‚Äôt think the self-aware jokes landed that well here. 

Rant over.",2024-01-27
"I am so much disappointed with the ending of that movie. It had a good promise but last 20 minutes ruined everything.  


I believed that Ken patriarchy was a parody of all sigma male / andrew tate fans mindset. It seemed logical to show that when Barbies do not care about Kens then the Kens rebel and express ultra-male behaviors like that sigma male bs. When Kens gave up on patriarchy I hoped the movie would end with conclusion that Ken doesn't need to be overly masculine to be seen worthy and Barbie doesn't need to be perfect to be a Barbie but instead it showed that Kens after ending patriarchy again became trash and 2nd class citizens while Barbies have all the control. And Margot Robbie Barbie would not love or care about Ken Ryan Gosling  no matter how hard he tries.  


""Now Ken has as much power as woman in real world"" - what the hell is that even supposed to mean. The movie seemed like a suggestion to end gender war and gender stereotypes but instead added more gasoline to the fire.  I don't know what world director had in mind but I live in country where both genders could vote since country was created in 1918. Country that was a soviet satelite where everyone was equal to law. Where woman and man were both viewed as equal workers. I work in a place where boss is woman. In the office I am surrounded by women and they earn as much as me or even more. They are free to take days off anytime their kids feel sick and I have to stay late and meet the deadlines when workforce is reduced. Since I'm male I am also expected by the law to carry heavier packages and fight in the wars.   


And don't talk about men being 99% of CEOs. Without having rich connections me  (young male) and you (young female) both have 0% chances of becoming CEO of big company. It's not war men vs women, it should be war poor vs rich and powerful.  


Since Kens were rulers only during Ken Patriarchy and returned to being 2nd class citizens after ending their male kingdom then this film suggests that if men want to be respected and rule in their households they need to be sigma assholes. Good job, movie suggests making things even worse.   


AND WHAT THE HELL MEANS THAT BARBIE BECAME A REAL WOMAN AND WENT TO A GYNECOLOGIST? Like what's the point of that scene? Is that supposed to piss off all mtf trans?",2024-01-28
"All I can say was this movie was a treat. As someone who grew up with barbies, loves the actors (especially ryan gosling), and loves other outside references, I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better time watching the movie. How good this movie depends on how much you can relate to it. Went with a group of friends and i don‚Äôt think some of the people got the references (one of the guys didn‚Äôt know what cellulite was so that joke went over) however the other half of my group were crying laughing throughout the movie especially during depression barbie. I will admit the plot was pretty shallow in some areas but honestly I didn‚Äôt go expecting the plot to be WOW. I expected comedy and feel good movie and that‚Äôs what I got!",2023-07-23

I still can't believe that Greta is the friend/co-worker/roommate in No Strings Attached. From C list actor to A list director... that's impressive.",2023-09-09
"The set and costume design was fantastic. It was visually fun to watch. I agree the story and message were all over the place. It was never fully established what caused Barbie‚Äôs 50% role in the rift, though it suggested it was maybe that she was only stereotypical Barbie, and perhaps, deep down that wasn‚Äôt enough for her. This was not made very clear, though, and this seems like a plot point rather than something that can remain ambiguous. Meanwhile, commentary on various aspects of society was HAMMERED into the audience through monologue and pithy aphorisms like ‚Äúmothers stand still so their daughters can look back‚Äù yada yada I still have no idea how that was relevant or what it means in the context of this Barbie movie. 

The other big issue is that Margot Robbie as Barbie out-acted every other character. She seemed more nuanced and human than even the human characters. Maybe this was purposeful? But it‚Äôs probably a lot of the reason why a lot of men got upset at the depiction of Kens and men as ridiculous. Truly, every single character in this film was ridiculous‚Ä¶ except for Barbie. She was the only one who acted out depth. That, and maybe the ghost of Handler? But to be honest, I don‚Äôt really understand the point of Handler as the creator of Barbie. She always knew Barbie would surprise her? Why? I wanted more explanation for lines like this and less explanation of the cognitive dissonance etc.",2023-09-17
The opening scene looked exactly like one of the Barbie commercials from the 1990s,2023-09-26
"I liked this movie, there were *a lot* of layers and cultural references. In particular, I liked the framing around 2001 Space Odyssey, it was an adept way to show how Barbies were conceived of as a feminist response to ""baby dolls"", something most people don't know, because similar to how Monopoly was created as a critique of capitalism and the cotton gin was invented to end slavery... ironically and for a lot of reasons, that's not exactly how things went.  


On a subtler level, that scene was an adept call to action for any woman who has spent her life passively consuming the work of great (male) directors, it's a funny and jarring reminder of how absent any genuine female POV has been in the history of cinema. If you are a woman or nonwhite and a film buff, you learn a lot about the white male brain from watching the cannon as it developed over the last hundred years, so much that it's hard to know exactly what to do with it all.  


That said, it wasn't my favorite movie of the year, I haven't seen it yet but pretty sure that's going to be Poor Things.",2024-03-03
Am I the only one that feels like the mother/daughter plotline had major plot holes? Where did the pent up aggression start? They never talked about it besides that conversation at the end but even then I don‚Äôt think that was enough. I honestly thought it was a single mom thing but then they show the dad out of nowhere. Idk just kinda feel like they could‚Äôve done more with that because just the flashbacks had me tearing up.,2023-07-22

"i actually saw this movie two times in separate theaters today! it's definitely not what i was expecting. i loved the cast, character design, set design, cinematography, etc. i also like both of the major topics the film discusses; the patriarchy and personal identity. here's some of the points i especially liked:

- the acknowledgment that stereotypical barbie is not an achievable appearance and is incredibly unrealistic
- the fact that a group of men were behind the doll meant to ""empower women""
- barbie feeling violated and threatened in the real world while ken felt powerful and strong
- THE MOVIE DIDNT END WITH BARBIE DATING KEN! I LOVED THAT!
- i also loved how barbie said NO to ken and stood by it
- i also love that the movie ended with telling men to also find their own sense of identity in the patriarchy, and that they're more than what sexism tells them to be
- the beach off thing is funny

all in all, i had a good time! good way to kill a couple (or four) hours",2023-07-23

I know it's not intersectional enough for some people. But I think that's okay, most movies aren't feminist at all, or are straight up anti feminist, and don't get this kind of drive by criticism. It's a movie about a toy.

Anyways was a great movie, just an absolute blast to see. May see it again next weekend.",2023-07-24

Actually if you look at the timeline of Barbie and Ken dolls - there was President Ken and First Lady Barbie before there was President Barbie, there was Pilot Ken and Flight attendant Barbie before there was pilot barbie, there was doctor Ken and nurse Barbie before doctor was a barbie.

It doesn‚Äôt really matter for the movie but it‚Äôs just funny to see people so passionate about Mattel‚Äôs revisionist history that Barbie was some trailblazer, when actually so many of her jobs just fell into the stereotypical women jobs while an accompanying Ken doll was made with the man job.",2023-07-27

The dance number at the end full on had me in tears.",2023-07-24
"Let me know if I am overthinking. A lot of people are calling the movie as man hating, but I came out thinking it had a really good message. The Kens were all competing against each other, in this toxic struggle that I feel like a lot of men struggle with. Societal expectations often pushes men to want to be better than other men. It's like a constant struggle to need to get validation by competing against other guys. It seems men more often than women struggle with finding importance in their life and feeling valued. Part of that is feeling the need to find a beautiful woman to feel validation, that's something I felt as well. Then you have Barbie tell Ken he isn't defined by his girlfriend, he is defined by who he is. Same with the choreography dance of the ken battle. It was hilarious but at same time I feel like the message was obvious. There is no need to keep trying to compete against each other, be happy with who you are, and have a brotherhood akin to what a lot of women have in how they support each other.

Who did she screw, Ken? And I was like what? And he‚Äôs like, why‚Äôd she go to gynac then?

"I like how stereotypical Barbie is an analogy for how to reflect on life.

She starts out living life tiptoeing all the time, with everything appearing to be perfect. And it does appear so because she conforms to societal expectations on what stereotypical Barbie is supposed to be. She's supposed to be what the normal or average Joe is.

And this is of course, very tiring.

While partying she suddenly becomes conscious of death. Just like how the average person occasionally becomes aware of their mortality, they are forced to make a choice - whether to brush it aside as a joke (which Barbie did and the rest accepted it), or to act on this realization.

But knowing this changes Barbie (as all people who reflect on Death are changed by it). She notices her blemishes. She no longer can live life tiptoeing all the time like everyone else. She cannot go back to living life as stereotypical Barbie.

She then meets weird Barbie who is often criticized for being weird - and she is very different from all the Barbies. She does not conform, has her own views, and is not trapped by societal expectations - the exact opposite of stereotypical Barbie. But Barbie is only here because she has no choice. Weird Barbie gives her a ""choice"" to help her feel better - but she just wants to forget having a choice and live in Barbie land perfectly forever and ever. Barbie obviously chooses to want to remain ignorant, but that doesn't work because she actually has to go to the real world. But this is the start of her self actualization - actually confronting the real world.

She then has a complete breakdown over being torn apart by Sasha. And then she meets her creator when confronted by her feelings of self doubt as to whether she is enough. Eventually even her Dreamland is torn apart by Ken, for whom shatters her ideal homeland that she loves so much. She is forced to face reality and fight to preserve what is precious for her. And she succeeds - turning the patriarchy on itself (in an admittedly simple way) but pokes fun on what the conventional patriarchy is.

When her homeland is finally restored - breaking the Barbies free of the brainwashing and allowing them to restore the ideal world to what they think it should be - she has a choice. She is changed entirely from the experience she had in the real world, and she can choose to continue living in Barbie world (a Dreamland where everything is ""perfect"" and there is nothing she needs to think about) or go to the real world (where everything is confusing, imperfect, filled with change and difficult to navigate).

And of course, Barbie being changed, can no longer go back to being just a ""stereotypical Barbie"". She wants to know whether she can Be, or know her purpose - for which her creator says she wasn't designed with purpose because her ending isn't written - but instead warns her that to take the next step is to be irrevocably changed.

And the way to that change is to close her eyes and Feel. She literally becomes aware, and for the first time she Breathes. It is an analogy that for ourselves to become aware and to start to live life, is to bring ourselves to feel, and be aware of our very breath, the one change that allows us to continue living from moment to moment. She becomes alive for the first time, and chooses to accept everything that comes with it, with the changes and difficulty it brings.

She no longer lives in Barbie world, and the bridge between both worlds is sealed forever. And the very first thing she does is to accept and live - with some fear and trepidation, while being supported by her real world ""family"" - as a woman, by seeing a gynaecologist. Perhaps it was intended to be a final joke since Barbies don't have vaginas, and needs to settle that aspect to live in the real world, but to me it appeared to be accepting and embracing a fundamental aspect of herself - that despite having always been a woman by design as a doll, actively embracing that identity and owning it is another thing altogether. She actively chooses who she is.

And to embrace who you are is when you truly begin to live. Whether you choose to go to the real world (like Barbie did), or let things go back to how they normally are (Ken is Kenough).

Perhaps as a commentary on various things it is shallow. It pokes fun at itself from time to time and doesn't shame people for choosing to live in the Dreamworld (eg. When Sasha's mom actively embraces Barbie and her quirky side and snaps back at Sasha saying that she just wants to be happy for once). In that aspect it is quite ""real"" to me in that these are very human responses.

But to me, I appreciate the message that no matter how stereotypical each of us may be, we always have the capacity to reflect and choose differently, and in so doing truly live life.",2023-08-06

"Considering this is still active, I think the biggest problem with the Barbie movie is it never really explains why the patriarchy is bad or if anything, how it truly works.

Right now, people are saying patriarchy is evil because ""sexism"". But if you ask people how it's sexist, seems like most answers will be based around ""evil"" reasons. Which means society was built around evil reasons?

I feel its misleading. When simply, the patriarchy is just unnecessary.",2023-10-23

Didn‚Äôt feel like a women vs men or had any ‚Äúfuck white incels‚Äù moments, just a fun, good hearted movie that shows how the patriarchy fucks us all over.

"I can't believe there are people zoning in on President Barbie denying Ken an immediate higher position and calling that hypocritical, all while ignoring Ken's actual, *real* empowerment. The entire point of the resolution here is supposed to be a flip on the way tokenism works. In the real world, it's common to make a woman CEO and call it a day and tell them to stop complaining (literally happens earlier when the exec brings up the two women CEOs), but there's rarely ever actual empowerment that's encouraged, which is about identity.

Compare that to the movie and it's the exact opposite because they're urging that Ken figure out his identity SEPERATE from Barbie, which is what actual empowerment is. But that's not how it works irl because a big part of patriarchy relies on defining what the idea and role of a woman should be according to men. Women are not encouraged (and in a lot of places not even allowed) to figure out their identity separate from men.

If you watch this movie and think the message is men = bad or that it's about ""female superiority"" then idk man. It just reinforces the entire point of the movie which is that patriarchal systems of thinking negatively affect both men and women and is a net negative to the world. It's also true that it affects women to a larger degree due to them not having as much power.",2023-07-22

Particularly the line (and I am sorry if I misquote) from Barbie saying ‚ÄúYou are not defined by me, or by the job you do‚Äù to Ken. I think there are many men in todays society that look up to these men like Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate, etc and define their existence on ‚Äúfind a wife, be a man, make money‚Äù but at the end of the day they don‚Äôt know who they are.

"I went in expecting it to be a movie crapping on men based on a bunch of biased takes on the movie from many sources. Instead did quite the opposite, bringing forth both issues of genders, and I like how Ken and Barbie both flipped through the antagonist and protagonist of each other throughout the film. The irony of the song ""push"" being played was great that mightve gotten lost on some people unfamiliar with matchbox 20. Personally, I really liked the ending sequence with Ken breaking down and crying, saying it's okay to cry and be open with his emotions, and especially the whole ""I am enough"" scene, realizing he doesn't need barbie nor does she need him, partially playing on the fact that Ken always was a side character/ an afterthought of the whole barbie franchise for people years ago but also as a statement to many men and women who put all their self worth based on their partnership or lack thereof. Didn't think I'd actually tear up at a movie like barbie but that whole segment struck a chord with me. 

I also appreciate the fact that it called out how barbies in the past (along with media as a whole) has really affected how a lot of women felt growing up and how difficult it is to deal with body issues in a world where women ""have to be skinny BUT not TOO skinny, you have to be xyz"" as one of the barbies mentioned, and how self conscious women have become due to the unrealistic expectations of media and the ""stereotypical barbie"".
All in all it was a pretty good movie with positive messages for both genders to take away from. Was wholesome enough to keep me captivated at what will happen next. Definitely a lot of humorous moments that got me to chuckle along with my friends and the people in the theater. The ""You are enough"" theme was great and I don't care what other biased sources complain about how problematic this movie is, because it isn't and anyone who says that completely missed all the underlying themes of the movie. Solid 8/10 for me.",2023-08-08
"It started out really promising but then towards the end four separate plotlines got mushed together into a whole blurry mess (Barbie on what it means to be human, Ken's patriarchy saga, the whole mother-daughter story and whatever Will Ferrell was doing).  


*By far* the most interesting of these plotlines is Ken's story, and I feel like if the filmmakers had focused on this it could've been a great satirical comedy on how the ""oppressed"" Kens reclaim their self identity and gain mutual respect with the Barbies, turning the whole gender norm on its head. I get why they couldn't do that - the irony of having Barbie's movie be ultimately about Ken would fly over most people's heads  - but because of that they sacrificed coherence and ultimately made the film lose both its steam and focus. I was expecting to love this film based on both its visuals and the director's prior work but it ended up being one of my biggest disappointments of the year.",2023-08-16

I also kinda felt bad for the Kens at the end.

"Something about Barbie sitting with the old lady at the bench really got to me.

Barbie calling her beautiful and the old lady responding with ‚ÄúI know‚Äù was such a fun moment with so much emotional substance underneath.

I felt like Barbie at that moment recognized this is a real woman who has changed and has lived a full life, it‚Äôs just a stark contrast to Barbie who is destined to never change who practically relives the same day everyday, someone who fears changes because it goes against what she is (cellulite, her feet falling flat, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be stereotypical Barbie‚Äù, etc.)

And Barbie recognizes this contrast, but for the first time ever she doesn‚Äôt despise the effects of change, she recognizes how much of a privilege it is to grow and be a person, so she ultimately whispers a small ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so beautiful‚Äù at the grandma

"I'm a 31 year old man. I absolutely loved this movie. I really enjoyed that it wasn't JUST about women empowerment because it's more than that. Even just a little bit about Ken learning to be enough for himself is a great message because a lot of people in general feel that they're not fulfilled if they're not in a relationship. As someone that is currently separated with their spouse, this really spoke to me.

Edited to add as it might seem like I don't like the women empowerment. I think it's a fantastic movie for women of all ages to watch and realize they can be what they want to be. I'm just glad it also added a sprinkle of something for Ken because I think that it's a real problem that people every day face in thinking they have to be in a relationship or have the perfect job. You're Kenough.",2023-07-26

"It's good. Some of the jokes didn't land, the entire Mattel sideplot could be cut, and some scenes became very preachy nearly to the point of parody.

But it's one of the more unique films I've seen. It was a good old fun time. Also, Ryan Gosling is, by far, the best part of this film. He absolutely stole the show in every scene he was in. I would not mind a sequel called ""Ken"" focusing on him.

"The girl calling Barbie a fascist is foreshadowing, as the Barbies use disenfranchisement to claim victory over their political opponents.",2023-08-10
"I think this movie is kind of suffering with how overhyped it is because I was expecting a masterpiece like Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, but this movie is just okay. I think the jokes were pretty funny, but the pacing just seemed fast at times. 

I feel like my biggest gripe with the film is that Barbie and Ken spent so little time in the real world. Ken discovers patriarchy, and Barbie discovers how hard being a woman is so quickly, and it just feels rushed. I think the movie would've benefitted greatly, having fewer Barbie world scenes and more real world scenes. 

My other problem is the lack of focus on Gloria and Sasha's relationship. Sure, we saw them sort of grow in having a relationship, but it wasn't enough, and I think the movie missed out on showing how Barbie has really impacted generations of women who grew up playing the dolls and how Gloria and Sasha played with the dolls as kids.

As for the ""controversial"" feminism aspect of the film, I think I will be even more controversial in saying that I don't think the feminist discourse in the film went far enough. Barbie has been created in pretty much every race and ethnicity, so I felt it was kind of a loss to not discuss much of intersectionality in feminism and recognize that the discrimination women face is often compounded by their race, ethnicity, cultural background, etc. But I suppose this wouldn't have been included in the film because the girl boss feminism featured was already getting enough sensitive people's feelings hurt. 

Also, the Mattel squad of bumbling idiots was really unnecessary. Pretty much every scene featuring them could've been cut from the film, in my opinion. 

In conclusion, I wish I hadn't heard about all the hype surrounding the Barbie movie because it set my expectations to really lofty ideals that the movie didn't meet. I would watch again for the jokes and the acting, but the plot leaves so much to be desired.",2023-08-15
"I sadly didn't enjoy the movie at all. It truly felt like the writers thought that the movie was going to be critical about modern-day society, but it wasn't. It felt much more like a 2 h commercial for the Barbie doll, which has been long forgotten by most parents, who were gently reminded that this product still exists and that it stands for female empowerment. It's just sad to see, that so many people felt like the movie discussed this topic well, when in reality it was just a shallow wanna-be movie.",2023-09-11
"WTF with Will Farrell?  He contributed nothing, seems to be ad libbing. Weirdly pulls you out of the film whenever he is on screen.",2023-09-12
"I liked a lot of this movie... it's well made, the music, the set pieces, the edit is all great... however the heavy handed girls have it harder than boys is there when it doesn't need to be. It basically ends that men will not get a say in Barbieland so long as women don't get a say in the real world, but.. half the real world supreme court justices are women, the Vice President is a woman. Women are increasingly dominating corporate executive positions in many companies, including my own. It really misses the we're all in this together no matter the gender part. It's not a war.  My point is emphasized by the fact that his was THE biggest movie of the year. 

Now, I think they're just constantly on the edge of saying that with Ken, but they really just don't ever deliver on it. They portray things like doing Duolingo, managing finances, and expressing passion for old movies as some sort of irredemable sin. 

More than half of people in college are women... and now there is basically a crisis where men aren't going to school and becoming polarized to the point where their identity has become Trumpism. Let's not act like men have no emotions, or social intelligence, and should just be subservient because a jaded woman says so. The real world mom's monologue on this was just a take on humans, not just women. The movie was clearly written by a woman (in the same vain that female characters in movies written by men are way off). It's just reversing the roles. 

But like I said at the beginning, it's still well made and fun. Made me laugh more than any other movie this year. Maybe this movie is more for the world rather than for California kids like myself.",2023-12-24
"Overall enjoyed the movie. The first 30 minutes was solid and the transition into the second act was also a great time. Margot and Ryan truly stole the show. The set designs, the campy nature mixed with some emotional gravitas, MOST of the dialogue, choreography and songs, and the fun nature of Barbieland and their references to toy life.

My major con was that the messages near the end felt a bit too vindictive. I felt the first half of the story did a good job of conveying the struggles of a woman (the culture shock of the real world being male dominated in ways that were taken for granted, like the construction worker crew, and how Ken in reverse noticed men making decisions or in places of influence). Although Barbie had the clearest arc, I felt Ken had the most dynamic potential for character with the Kens being kind of purposeless and forgotten and sort of accessories to Barbie early in the movie, but by the end when the Barbies try to retake Barbieland it felt all that nuance was thrown away and men/Kens were simplified and denigrated and we sort of return to where we started at the beginning? The kens still don‚Äôt have a place, and although she emphasized ‚ÄúKen is you‚Äù, it was rather shallow and she did it in a way that was kind of harsh without any real compassion (after having just gone through that trauma herself). So idk. I felt the movie conveyed this idea that for women to feel safe/liberated/heard/valued that it‚Äôs a zero sum game with one gender needing predominant power, as opposed to building both up and learning to value the other strengths and weaknesses alike, empowering maleness and femaleness and how thag can build each other up.

Also I felt the finale was noticeably horribly paced compared to the first half. They attempted to rapidly resolve the teen girl/mom and it felt way too fast inorganic (with how nasty she was), the CEOs kind of got forgotten? (And really shouldn‚Äôt have even come to Barbieland as they added nothing), and they attempted to give Barbie like 3 different character resolutions. It just felt like too much and the movie really dragged and kept hammering the same points with TELLING as opposed to SHOWING by the end, which i felt the movie was doing very well in the beginning.",2023-07-21
"Spoilers don‚Äôt read if you didn‚Äôt watch:

I feel like Ken‚Äôs point of view is so much deeper than just sidekick. I felt like it was supposed to represent how women felt prior to the feminist movement ‚Äî- never owning anything, feeling like your spouses accessory, no sense of identity and self worth outside of your partner and their accomplishments, making yourself seem perfect, the idea of your own gender pitting itself against each other for attention. There‚Äôs a reason Ken complains about not owning a Barbie dream house and says to Barbie he wanted it to be *their* house. Even the random dance number with Ken‚Äôs ‚Äî I can‚Äôt tell you how many classic 50‚Äôs films that have a random dance break with only women. 

Barbie land as a matriarchy was also extremely unfair. I felt the whole point of the movie is trying to find a more harmonious blend and balance for gender roles and also trying to give men an understanding of what it‚Äôs actually like for women. No wonder so many men hate Barbie land. Welcome to the real world lol.

Ken and the other Kens making a kendom really reminded me of 70s feminist movement. The Ken‚Äôs finally gain autonomy at the end (kind of like how the real world woman social revolution outcome) and the narrator makes it clear that barbie land is still matriarchal. That the Ken‚Äôs will have to work their way up/create change (like with the district court judge instead of Supreme Court judge statement). That‚Äôs where women are today in society ‚Äî still fighting for change.

The thing that gets me too is Ken‚Äôs doll plays on the already mass marketed and available toys for men prior to the feminist movement. The cowboy and boxer theme was everywhere. All little girls had were baby dolls ‚Äî boys had cowboy toys etc. boys could see themselves in anything. Ken in the patriarchal world can see himself in anything and any job he wants. That‚Äôs trying to explain to the viewer that Barbie land is so important for younger girls because they can see themselves as having limitless potential. 

Barbie isn‚Äôt about hating men ‚Äî- it‚Äôs about recognizing that she was a huge cultural shift where little girls suddenly had a toy that showed they could be anything. Barbie owned her own things before many women could get their own credit card.

It‚Äôs actually incredible how a lot of men just don‚Äôt understand this movie. And it‚Äôs disappointing because I felt like Ken might have drove the point home. 

My grandmother couldn‚Äôt have a credit card or property for most of her life ‚Äî and she was addressed as her husbands name. we are not as far removed from serious systemic sexism that people like to think we are. We clearly still live in a patriarchal society and some women have to bust their ass to get to where they want to be ‚Äî but they do it to help the girls after them.",2023-07-23

"I have been excited about this movie ever since I realized that Greta Gerwig was directing it. Ryan Gosling as Ken was just the cherry on the ice cream sundae. 

The opening scene was killer and perfect. Then as Barbie's world was set up, I started to get a little nervous- was this movie going to be too full-blown Barbie? Not what I expected with Gerwig at the helm- and then Barbie's existential crisis began. Perfect. 

I thought that the movie was great- cinematic and fun, just like I had hoped. I've been a fan of Gerwig's dance choreography style ever since I saw her performance with the Arcade Fire for the YouTube Music Awards... and it was so fun to see a couple of those moves in one of the dance sequences for this film. 

One of my favorite sequences was when Barbie was being chased in the maze of cubicles- sign me up for silly stylized chaos. I used to watch musicals when I was younger, and Gerwig is definitely reminding me that I need to revisit the genre. 

Ryan Gosling was so much fun to watch as Ken- the way that he sang and played guitar for Barbie was just... over the top in such a relatable way. Not to mention his performance of the Ken song- he really did find his Kenergy. 

I can see how this movie might not be for everybody. I love Gerwig's work, but she definitely is part of the indie crowd, and she wanted to make a Barbie film, not a Barbie movie. Barbie thinking about death and humanity? It's not a kid's movie, which is a little confusing. But for me- it was just what I hoped for. I was surprised at how emotional watching this movie was for me, honestly. Didn't expect that. 

Side note: I watched this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2rNnOGfmv0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2rNnOGfmv0) interview and Gerwig talks about some of the films that inspired her. It's a fun watch.",2023-07-22

Plus they make the Barbie world seem like a reverse gender version of the real world, but then bring up stuff like the Supreme Court in Barbie world being all female when that's not true in the real world so the parallels don't even work unless you exaggerate the sexism of the real world.

I also liked how everyone in Barbieland wanted to move on and not forget everything they went through. I think it was a good reminder that struggle and difficulty is something to inspire you and keep you from making the same mistakes. 

The only thing I wish is that the Barbies and Kens were equal at the end- maybe that‚Äôs what they were trying to say when President Barbie told them they could have positions in lower court?? Also, I‚Äôm still wondering where the Kens sleep lol. 

I also wish that at the end the Barbies valued the Kens more, but I LOOOOVED how Margot Robbie Barbie helped Ken understand that he needed to find identity outside of her. I thought that was such a good message.

Overall, I really liked and enjoyed the movie and would like to see it again!! I think it‚Äôs a good movie to get people talking, and Barbie was a perfect way to do that. Also it was beyond fun to dress up and make going to the movie such a fun event.",2023-07-24
That had no right to be as good as it was. The plot was a bit all over the place but oddly that didn't get in the way of a good meaningful film. Puts into question other tie in films. Gosling stole the show,2023-07-24
"The movie was great! I really missed fun movies like this. I wish it was longer. I also was surprised by the plot, found myself liking it more than I expected and I certainly didn‚Äôt expect the whole Ruth thing",2023-07-25
"Thought it was a very good movie, where lots of the bits worked and some didn't.

It feels strange to say considering the message of the movie, but I thought anytime the Kens were on screen the movie was significantly better. I thought the movie was 10-15 minutes too long because it felt like it really tried to add on the emotional elements with Ruth at the end, but they just didn't sit with me. Not sure why Barbie needed to become human unless it's to set up a sequal. 

Gosling was incredible, Robbie was divine, Kate Mackinnon was pretty funny as well. The theme is definitely on the nose and sometimes felt a little too much so, but again that would depend on the viewer. Loved the I'm Just Ken dance number.",2023-07-25
"Something I have not seen mentioned much is the final montage. It had me crying like a baby 
Despite all the struggles humans go through, all the difficulties in our daily lifes, trying to overcome expectations (both by society and imposed by us), trying to find ourselves and the meaning in our lives, by the end it is all worth it. 
Barbie also sees that; even though she had all these horrible new emotions and feelings she is willing to try and succeed in our world.
It is a beautiful take on humanity, more than feminism or women's rights.",2023-07-26
omg this movie was hilarious all the way through. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time,2023-07-27
I really liked the movie. One thing I‚Äôm confused by though is why did the Kens get a lower position of power than Barbies? I thought this was all gonna end up being a both Barbie and Ken government with the message being ‚Äúno one should be denied a place because of their gender (Ken or Barbie)‚Äù. They won‚Äôt let a Ken have a seat at the table and the narrator makes it worse saying Kens will work their way up to have as much power as women in the real world. I thought we established that the world was run by men and a horrible place for women. Am I looking too far into things/completely missing the point?,2023-07-27
Ryan Gosling putting on 2 sunglasses is already became a meme lol,2023-07-28
"I already posted my main thoughts, but does anyone else think that The Godfather was a weird choice for the movie that the Kens love? I get that it‚Äôs always been seen as the definitive ‚Äúman‚Äù movie, but it doesn‚Äôt make much sense for what we know about the Kens otherwise. For one, they love horses, and Godfather‚Äôs most famous scene involves a decapitated horse. Beyond that, though, with the way the Kens like to one-up and out-macho each other, along with the movie‚Äôs obvious themes of capitalism and men‚Äôs place in the corporate world, wouldn‚Äôt Fight Club have made way more sense? That‚Äôs definitely the movie that those Kens would obsess over and misinterpret.",2023-07-28

I felt the main message boiled down to ‚Äúexisting is hard‚Äù maybe ‚Äúexisting as a women is hard‚Äù as it was aimed primarily to women though as a guy I found myself sort of understanding ken a bit.

Absolutely adored the movie. Important messages are being communicated in a fresh and funny way. We need more movies like this. The younger generations give me hope.,2023-08-05
"Saw it today with my two grown daughters. Beautiful set, and cute scenes, but a serious undertone that overtook me. I cried and cried, and I am not exactly sure why. I played with Baribies as a young girl. I had the house, the corvette, the plane, the camper... all of it! I am not sure it shaped who I became to be or not, because I was also a Tom boy. 

I think the film missed an opportunity to extend and explain a little more about America's speech. It's we, women who project all those expectations on ourselves, it's not just ""the patriarchy.""  I keep myself down. I hate myself in clothes. I am not thin enough. It's me, I'm the problem. 

Excellent, fun, and deeper film than one might think.",2023-08-06

"I (20M) watched it yesterday quite stoned, I cried like 7 times and it's now my favourite movie

This is the closest to a 10/10 movie I've ever seen. My last favourite movie was Your Name, but I admitted it had some weak points (mostly the ending, which was too long and slow for my taste). Here's ALL I didn't like from Barbie:

-I felt like there were too many horses jokes, although some of them were hilarious.

-I didn't get why when they threw clothing items from Barbie's house they stopped and showed the article. I guess it's a joke but I don't see how it's funny.

-I found it a bit cringey when the little girl is telling her mother that she likes her weird and dark drawings.

That's all the complaints I can think of, aside from that I loved everything: the jokes landed, I understood the characters, the casting and acting was amazing, the design of everything was great, the pacing felt appropriate, the original soundtrack was bop after bop, the choreographies were spectacular... And of course I loved the message and I felt very personally all of Barbie's struggles, even the ones related to the fact that she's a woman even though I'm a cishet man. Maybe weed makes me more empathetic.

Just five minutes in I understood why American conservatives were so upset with the movie, the feminism was evident (and it's a good thing!). I found it so funny when they were presenting Barbieland as the perfect female fantasy, showing mostly childish things, and suddenly there was a Barbie giving a speech about how being more emotional doesn't make you worse for any serious job, and it's even a good thing. This kind of direct messages were everywhere, like when Ken and Barbie are walking in the real world with everyone staring at them, and Ken clearly states that he isn't feeling any kind of danger while Barbie does feel threatened.

Except for the Mattel workers and in a lesser way the mother and daughter, I felt like the real world was completely realistic, the sexism wasn't as exaggerated as some say. It isn't hard to find someone who actually acts like each sexist person they interact with, the fact that they find so many in so little time is unlikely but completely possible.

I don't remember exactly every scene I cried with, but I can tell you that at least every time they played the instrumental of Billie Eilish's song. I cried with the scene of the old woman whom Barbie calls beautiful, with both of the creator's scenes, the mother's first speech, basically everytime Barbie was crying on screen, and weirdly, at the end of Ken's musical number (that key change really got to me). I consider myself a nihilist, so I accept death as part of life and I understand there's nothing else beyond it; but I had never felt like death was such a human thing as when Barbie was giving up her perfect, immortal life. Damn, I'm crying again.

Anyway. I'm scared of watching this movie again sober and realizing it wasn't as good as I think it is. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have cried nearly as much if I hadn't been high, but at least I'll never forget what I felt, it was almost life-changing.",2023-08-24
I am still living in delusion that Barbie made 1.4 billion at box office,2023-09-12
"The lessons about humanity, compassion, noticing the other person, what it's like to be a woman and a man, and how both sexes have their own struggles and their pain deserve to be noticed, acknowledged, and praised. The final scene where Barbie both metaphorically and literally grows up and decides to become human was tearjerking, definitely the top highlight of this movie.

But damn, if most of the good stuff just gets drowned in the approach of ""Telling"" instead of ""showing"". Ken's patriarchal rules that came from the place of wanting to be respected for who he/they are was a good story, telling every second sentence how ""patriarchy is bad"" was not. There are moments where this really original and refreshing movie becomes some sort of lecture which is quite possibly the most boring way to show things. Exposition by info dumps rarely ends well for the consumer, it makes the whole experience really shallow.

And I get that overall this movie was partially a satire of many modern things but Christ, those Mattel executives were just... ugh. Completely unfunny and unnecessary, they brought nothing but annoyance. Even if the idea behind them was laughing at capitalism as a whole and pointing out consumptionism, I think there could've been a better way of showing that. Or definitely the more funny way.

Overall, a solid 7. The first 2/3 of the movie is a real mixed bag of good and bad, the last third made up for the movie's shortcomings. Barbie's conversation with Ruth, the war/dance-off scene, or just everything with that mother's presence in the Barbie World was on top.",2023-09-24

"As soon as I walked out of the theatre, I realized just how much the movie surprised me. It was meta and comedic, but without removing its multi-faceted messages. It was also eye-opening. As a young man, it may seem quite stupid but the movie made me question a lot of my double standards and presented a worldview of healthy relationships, empowerment, and true independence. I think what sets this movie apart from the most obvious wokeism cash grabs is that it stays true to its themes and finds ways to present them masterfully. It doesn't take itself seriously but knows it's saying things that people need to hear so it doesn't drown them out. I feel genuinely enlightened by my experience, and the messages the movie leveled toward its male audience were powerfully mature. This movie is simply strange to me. I have no idea how it was made, but I am glad I got the chance to see it.",2023-07-22
"I was expecting to like this movie but I laughed WAY harder at a lot of the jokes than I was expecting too. So many great unexpected gags in this. My favorites:

- President Barbie swearing 

- Ken thinking / wanting the patriarchy just to be about horses",2023-07-23
"Every time Ryan Gosling was on screen I was, at minimum, smiling & usually laughing. Margot Robbie is so sweet and charismatic it‚Äôs insane. Genuinely felt bad for her when she was excited to meet Abby & it ended with her walking away crying. 

Rest of the cast was fantastic as well. Simu Liu, Cera, McKinnon, etc. Even Ferrel was the right mix of his typical saying/doing off the wall stuff but never went over the top with it. 

If I had one complaint I‚Äôd say the messaging beats you over the head a bit & there‚Äôs maybe one too many monologues in the third act. Such a fun movie overall though those points don‚Äôt detract too much.",2023-07-23

"Here's an article I found to be interesting. Thoughts?

https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/07/conservatives-are-getting-barbie-wrong/

For those who can't access it:

>A confession, upfront: I probably would never have seen Barbie had it not come out the same weekend as Oppenheimer, thereby allowing me to do the full ‚ÄúBarbenheimer‚Äù last Thursday night. My review of Oppenheimer has already appeared. Of the Barbehneimer experience itself, I will say little more other than that it was exhausting.

>But exhaustion is not why it has taken a few days for me to assess Barbie fully. It is, rather, that Barbie is far less straightforward than Oppenheimer, with multiple interpretive and thematic layers. Oppenheimer is not an uncomplicated film, but Barbie is itself a highly sophisticated one - and one that many conservatives are almost certainly getting wrong.

>The story of Barbie is deceptively simple. A Barbie (Margot Robbie, as ""Stereotypical Barbie""), suddenly finds her idyllic life in Barbieland, the separate realm in which the Barbie dolls real-world people play with are represented anthropomorphically, disrupted by thoughts of death and other deviations from perfect Barbiedom. A visit to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), thus labeled because she has been marred by being played with a little too hard, sends her on a journey to our world to find the owner at the root of her discontent. And a Ken (Ryan Gosling), in a ploy for Barbie's attention (without which he can barely function), ends up a stowaway. While there, Barbie and Ken experience a reversal of sorts. Barbie discovers that she has not, in fact, empowered the world, and Ken appears to discover the glories of the ""patriarchy"" that dominates our reality. Shenanigans and further trips back and forth between Barbieland and our world ensue.

>The emerging conservative take on Barbie seems to be that it is a shallow, man-hating, and repulsive screed, an assessment that probably owes a great deal to the fact that Barbieland is an ostensible feminist utopia in which all Kens are subservient to all Barbies.
In the Wall Street Journal, former NATIONaL REvIEW critic Kyle Smith wrote that, ""As bubbly as the film appears, its script is like a grumpier-than-average women's studies seminar."" Upon leaving the movie, Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire tweeted that ""all you need to know"" about it is that ""it unironically uses the word 'patriarchy more than 10 times."" With some time to collect his thoughts, Shapiro then took to YouTube with a video titled: ""Ben Shapiro DESTROYS The Barbie Movie For 43 Minutes."" And the Critical Drinker, a right-leaning and perspicacious YouTube film critic, savaged Barbie, calling it ""the greatest lie ever told.""

>Before rebutting the substance of these cases, it's important to describe some of the technical, non-thematic things Barbie excels at. In the hands of writer-director Greta Gerwig (with her husband Noah Baumbach co-writing), Barbie has an utterly consistent and relentless aesthetic vision. All that pink paint (so much that it may have affected the global supply) went to good use in creating Barbieland. It is a remarkably silly place, where houses have no walls, water isn't real, and characters fake eating, drinking, surfing, doctoring, and other activities. It's so silly that I found it overwhelming, even revolting, initially. But eventually it won me over.

>At the center of Barbieland is Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie. The notion of portraying a live-action doll is not wholly without precedent in film history, but it is fairly absurd. Yet Robbie sells it totally. Even better is Gosling's Ken. His commitment to this earnest, goofy, desperate, and vain character is scene-stealing, and might have stolen the movie itself were it not up to something more complex than it appears.

>If Barbie were simply the feminist screed some of its critics are taking it for, it would be a failure - an interesting, pretty failure, to be sure, but a failure all the same. >!If this assessment were correct, then the fact that Ken, upon returning to Barbieland, makes it into a patriarchy to which all of its Barbies instantly submit would represent an inadvertently more compelling and potent satire than the vision Barbie appears to offer in its stead. A kind of shallow Yas-Queening comes to reign again in Barbieland by the movie's conclusion, with the Kens only *slightly* better off, and the Barbies still in charge after Robbie's Barbie, with the help of some real-life humans, breaks their patriarchal false consciousness.!<

>But this interpretation fails to account for so much that it is surely mistaken. For one, the real world is not represented as quite the patriarchy Ken, with his superficial Barbieland brain, makes it out to be. After an initial montage (mantage?) that marks his realization of the patriarchy, Ken is rebuffed in all of his attempts to join the male hierarchy that purportedly dominates the world. He must return to Barbieland to institute it; what he institutes there is so shallow that it collapses almost as quickly as it is set up. Meanwhile, though Robbie's Barbie restores female dominance in Barbieland, she chooses not to stay there, electing instead to become fully human. What it all appears to suggest is that Barbieland is not merely a superficial construct but an entirely satirical one: a kind of post-feminist satire of what feminists imagine a perfect world looking like and of what they imagine male dominance is like. Plato had a city in speech; Gerwig has given us a city in plastic.

>The scenes in reality, and involving humans, are of much greater import than those set in Barbieland. It is two humans, mother Gloria (America Ferrera) and daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who anchor the film. This is familiar territory for Gerwig, whose Ladybird has a similarly complicated mother-daughter relationship. It is Gloria's revelation of, and reveling in, the complications of real life that help to bring her daughter away from the crass cynicism in which she had been mired. And it is this embrace of reality, in all of its complications, transcending facile theorizing, that the film endorses. One sees this in Gloria's late-movie monologue, and in the realization by Mattel's corporate board that a ""reality Barbie"" would sell like hotcakes. It is especially evident in Stereotypical Barbie's decision to become human (a clever bookend to the 2001: A Space Odyssey reference that opens the film), with all its concomitant messiness.


>This is a bold claim. And one not without problems of its own. One male human character in our world might seem to counter the idea that Barbie means to complicate our appraisal of reality with his assertion that a patriarchy still exists, but we've just gotten better at hiding it. It also requires accepting entire portions of the movie - Helen Mirren's arch narration, almost everything that happens in Barbieland - as satirical. And it places upon the slender, plastic shoulders of a toy doll many layers of irony and complexity, perhaps more than they can reasonably bear. But detractors have a harder case to make. They must ignore, among other things, what happens to Robbie's Barbie and what the human world actually looks like. And perhaps most daunting, they must ignore the past work of Gerwig, who showed in Ladybird especially that she is far from some kind of straightforwardly vanguard feminist figure.


>I had to overcome my own hesitation to arrive at this view. Masculine pride makes it far easier for me to recommend Oppenheimer than to esoterically interpret Barbie positively. It is, to be clear, not really a movie about men. But it does not hate them. It is something far different, and far more interesting, than that. Conservatives who think otherwise might not be thinking big enough.",2023-08-07
Even better on 2nd viewing. Will probably go 3rd time before it leaves theaters cause my girl n I had such a good time.,2023-08-11
"Gerwig gets off on being meta. Every man will be able to relate to Ken cause he's ryan gosling and every man wants to be ryan gosling. And like alot of man his actions are heavily influenced by how hot a girl is and how we're willing to debase ourselves in the name of love.

Ken is a virgin. A incel.hes been friend zoned. He got advice from the wrong man and leaned heavy into being alpha, and only in the end does he gain self respect and fully self awareness. He went from ken to Kenaough",2023-09-11

"I loved a lot of elements in it. The humor is great, the tone is perfect, and Ryan Gosling is a gift to mankind. But I‚Äôm kinda let down by the absolute lack of a plot. The Mattel execs, the mother daughter dynamic, Barbie having to go find her real world user felt like ideas that needed a lot more rewrites before making their way into a Greta Gerwig film!!! I think the ending is great and really sticks the landing. But the middle was really disappointing to me. I get that the film was made to be a blockbuster and appeal to the ‚Äúgeneral audience‚Äù, but I felt a certain repetitiveness to the point the movie was trying to make.",2023-07-21
"I did enjoy Barbie but I feel like they lost their own point a few times and the ending was messy.

I might need to watch this again to actually form a more thought out opinion.",2023-07-21
"There was a good premise and I really enjoyed Robbie and Gosling, but overall found it a missed opportunity because I thought its message was too heavy handed‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôd have preferred the end to be warmer and point out that the Barbies and Kens are better as team that runs things together.

As it is, I‚Äôd give it no more than 6/10 personally.",2023-07-23
"I‚Äôve known it for awhile now, but Barbenheimer really cemented the fact that so many people do 0 research on the movies they go to see and then proceed to complain that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfamily friendly‚Äù or that it was ‚Äútoo political.‚Äù Hell, with Oppenheimer people were complaining about ‚Äútoo much dialogue and not enough action.‚Äù

Taking your kids to a PG-13 movie and then complaining about adult humor and themes is insanity.

Never ceases to amaze me how dumb the average person is.

Barbie rocked. Oppenheimer rocked",2023-07-23
"Alright, gentlemen in the room. How many of you teared up a few times? This movie has no right to be as good or meaningful as it is.",2023-07-24
"

I think what personally got to me was that I was *excited* about the feminism aspect but it fell short. The speeches were just. Awfully scripted. The message was cloudy, too. It felt jarringly like a 2013 tumblr post, almost like a parody of itself. Like, the speech would have been groundbreaking two decades ago but today it felt weirdly commercial. 

Very much tell, not show. With all the speeches they couldn't devote time to representing what she was saying in the movie!! No time given to developing the deteriorating mother-daughter relationship that was shown to BE THE CAUSE of the entire plot. No time to show her struggling with her job and being a mother. Or the restricive body standards. Finacial inequality. Balancing being emotional and direct. ALL of these were stated in the speech and ignored the rest of the movie. But they had time for a whole unnecessary plotline with goofy mattel men and a 10 minute ken musical number. 

Instead misogyny was shown as ""girls should wear booby clothes and serve men beer"" as if thats even SLIGHTLY the what the patriarchy is. They could've had the women be encouraged to wear that but then be slutshamed for giving in. They could've had women WANT to be a server and be ashamed of it. 

The solution was presented as ""women just need to realize whats wrong and believe in themselves and everything's solved, misogyny eradicated, yippee!!"" it all felt so hollow - it feels like they solved their cheap version of inequality and we should be grateful for it because at least the ""real world"" isn't as bad - BUT IT'S WORSE!! WAY MORE PERVASIVE AND SUBTLE AND SOUL CRUSHING. 

I feel so sad that i feel this way because i am so easy to please when it comes to movies especially cinema blockbusters. I just wanted to like it!!",2023-07-26
"Again, the movie is not woke. IT IS NOT WOKE.

Feminism YES, but do you got a problem with it?

Only woke if you got a problem with females want equality.  


Too many GOP-minded people seem to be very uncomfortable when females want equality is brought up, hmmmmm.",2023-08-11
"I went to see Barbie in the theaters. Everything was absolutely perfect except the plot. I adored the characters, the costumes were excellent, the music was amazing, and the set was phenomenal!

But, although I loved these aspects of the movie, I didn't like the movie. 

I felt like the movie didn't focus on the right theme. When Stereotypical Barbie first met the Sasha, Sasha made a statement about how Barbie was an unrealistic expectation of what girls should be (aka Blonde, skinny, perfect complexion). Stereotypical Barbie then tells her that Barbie wasn't supposed to be an unrealistic expectation but an inspiration that girls could be anything. I absolutely loved the idea of changing the stigmatism around Barbie by reinforcing that she is an inspiration of what a girl could be (hence all the different Barbie skin colors/ hair colors/ professions/ etc) and not a perfect idea of what a girl should be.

But then the movie's message started to change with focus being on Ken and his misunderstanding of what a man should be and what a woman should be, making the movie about Patriarchy v. Matriarchy. The focus slipped away from Barbie and idea that Barbie is a doll that instills inspiration into young girls and simply became a men vs. women movie.

I also felt there were many cheap references about the objetification of women in the real world. Although I understood the writers used these allusions to estabish the idea that Stereotypical Barbie was now in the imperfect, harsh real world, I felt like the writers should have focused more on showing all the imperfections of the real world (including that women are objectified in the real world but also including a homeless person here or a stray dog there...maybe even a couple yelling at each other). This way, instead of simply showing that the real world was harder for women, it would reinforce the idea that Stereotypical Barbie had left her utopia for the harsh reality of the real world. 


To make a long story short, I felt that Barbie should have focused more on the purpose and symbol of the Barbie doll with a subplot that dealt with Barbie v. Ken (and Ken's purpose) instead of focusing the movie on a Men vs. Women plot. I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

Are there others out there that agree?",2023-09-07
"I want to start off by saying that I enjoyed the Barbie movie. I did the Barbenheimer double feature, and that day is definitely one of the highlights of my summer. It was fun and chaotic, and really refreshing to see after being drained with all the connected, cinematic universes. But some of the plot and messaging of the movie just felt weird, and I was wondering if anyone else felt the way I did watching the movie.  
  
The things I did like were:  
  
The designs. It was absolutely amazing how they were able to replicate the Barbie Dreamhouse. The costume design is great, and it really felt like the dolls came to life.  
  
The acting was phenomenal. Especially Margot Robbie's and Ryan Gosling's. Personally, Gosling's Ken really carried the movie in my eyes, not to discredit Robbie as her acting was equally as impressive and I really felt the scenes where Barbie was experiencing true emotions for the first time.  
  
As a cinephile the movies references were a nice touch. Not in a way that said ""we're cultured we have movie references"" but it actually added to the plot. The 2001 Space Odyssey reference said that Barbie evolved toys the same way the monoliths evolved the monkeys and the humans.  
  
The appearance of the actual Barbera was a nice edition.  
  
When Ruth said ' I created Barbie so all my daughters could look back and see how far we've come' I felt that. It was only a sentence, but it was so powerful. My theater didn't give a big reaction to it, but it didn't need one. It was powerful enough on its own.  
  
Ken's character arc was really well done. Learning that he is 'kenough' and doesn't need a woman's validation and to just be himself was nice. His journey of self-discovery was nice to watch.  
  
The songs were great in the movie. I'm personally not a fan of Ice Spice, but I legitimately think the Barbie World remix was good.  
  
Alan was comedy gold in the movie. Even though it was random I loved the fight scene between him and the Kens.  
  
The cartoony physics made the movie more lighthearted.  
  
But there are some things that I didn't like about the movie:  
  
The Mattel board consisting of all men was weird considering since half of the Mattel board is women, and the head of Barbie has always been a woman. To people who don't bother researching about Mattel it just makes them look bad.  
  
America's speech I thought was pretty good. 'You have to be bossy, but not too bossy otherwise you come off as rude'. She made a lot of points and all of them were valid. You could feel frustration through the screen. I thought it was missed opportunity to not bring up so much of the male frustration. I know it's a 'Barbie' movie, but half the movie was about Ken, so I think they should've talked about it a bit more. A lot of men are confused and lost. It's a reason why influencers like Andrew Tate are so famous right now. They have the ability to take control of vulnerable men and warp their viewpoints. I think if they talked about male frustration a little more it could create an interesting conversation.  
  
As much as the movie loves to talk about the patriarchy, they never say anything about Barbieland being a matriarchy. They call out all the toxic men in the real world, which they should. Sexual harassment and inequality are topics that should be taken seriously and shouldn't be ignored. But they kind off brush off mistreating the Kens. The Kens have no houses, no jobs, are given no real personality outside of being attractive, and their happiness depends on if the Barbie's engage in conversation with them. At the end Barbie just says 'sorry for ignoring you' but things basically go back to how they were. You would think after all the things the Barbies and Kens went through, they would reject both the patriarchy and matriarchy and embrace a new system that benefits the both of them.  
  
The concept that the Barbie's were brainwashed and needed to be 'deprogramed' felt wrong. Because there is nothing wrong with being a traditional girlfriend, or a housewife, or a stay-at-home mom. It can be legitimately difficult and there's nothing wrong with having those types of traditional relationships as long as they're not abusive or toxic. Feminism should be about respecting women as individual beings who have their own aspirations and dreams. If a woman dreams about being a housewife, why not let them be one?  
  
It felt really wrong that it was encouraged to emotionally manipulate and gaslight the Kens and it was treated as something powerful.  
  
I understand that Ken wouldn't be the type of person to have social anxiety, but to say no man has social anxiety? Really?  
  
And there were some things in the movie that were just a straight up missed opportunity. Like when America's daughter talked about how Barbie gives girls poor body image, I was actually waiting for it to be brought up later. Because in 2016 a study was conducted that said girls (ages 6-8) were dissatisfied with their own bodies after just 5 minutes of playing with a Barbie doll. And another study which is now famous, black children were brought into a room. They were told to choose with doll they preferred between a white and a black doll. All of the kids said they preferred the white doll, because it 'looked more like them' and the black dolls were 'bad'. I think this shows that things like toys and television can impact the way children perceive beauty. I thought the movie would be this up later and say 'hey you don't have to look like Barbie, but we can aspire to be just as hardworking as Barbie' - but it was just used as a throwaway line in roasting session.  
  
I saw someone on the internet describe 'Barbie' this way and I have to agree. They said it 'felt like brainstorming turned into a movie'. The movie kind of felt half baked, and I feel like all it has done is perpetuate a gender debate on the internet instead of a conversation. Men and women both struggle, just in different areas of life. Women are more likely to be sexually harassed and discredited, and men are more likely to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts. Instead of competing with each other about who has it harder, we should be open to talking about these issues without antagonizing the other sex. That's how our problems will be solved.  
  
Again, I want to state that I liked 'Barbie'. It was a fun movie and nice change of pace from what general audiences typically watch. If you disagree with anything I said, I would love to hear what you have to say - because as I said earlier, I feel like it's important to have conversations about these types of things.

"Fun and silly movie with heavy-handed political themes. 

I particularly like the acknowledgment that Barbieland is a matriarchy and that Ken's obsession with patriarchy stemmed from finding self-worth, given his whole existence was to be a side piece to Barbie and that men largely have nothing there. The little bit at the end with them trying to find a spot in the government so they could have a voice and after the entire film they were still like 'nah lol' was pretty amusing, and it was nice that they pretty much outright stated that the Barbies were fighting to make kens go back to being second class citizens.

I know none of that was largely the point of the movie, but it would have felt wrong if they didn't bring that up at all, which they did. In hindsight, the entire Ken society was probably just a reflection of how women were treated, which was probably the point",2023-07-24
"Just saw it today, and surprisingly loved it!  

Gosling and Robbie play off each other perfectly, the mom and daughter characters were actually quite relatable, Kate McKinnon‚Äôs Weird Barbie stole every scene, and most importantly, the humour and political messages are well balanced, so the movie doesn‚Äôt swing too hard into unfocused comedy or heavy-handed preaching.

Plus the cherry on top; the sets, costume design and especially the choreography for the dance sequences were very well done!

As someone who both never played with dolls and hated Barbie, this is definitely a 9/10 for me.",2023-07-28

I'm not proud to say I related to ken when he was being toxic and felt like the movie was a wake up call for me. embarrassing it took a kids movie to explain it to me but I figure all I can do is capitalize on it.

"A group of teenaged boys started acting up, trying to disrupt things and then straight up walked out in the middle of America Ferrara‚Äôs monologue. Which ironically is an even better piece of satire than anything the movie did, which is a high bar to clear",2023-07-27
"Ok so I saw it and loved it but some parts did fall flat for me. 
1) The moms speech about the duality of womanhood. It felt like it was far too general to be relatable. As a woman myself I could relate to a few things but not the entire thing. I am sure lots of men could relate to it as well. It was so general I don‚Äôt think it was uniquely feminine. Also I don‚Äôt know why she was telling the Barbies all of this. Why would these non-human Barbie‚Äôs who have never experienced real Patriarchy understand this speech? I would‚Äôve liked it more if it had been a bit more personal to her own experience. Instead it felt like a buzz feed list she was rattling off. 
2) I think it‚Äôs pretty clear Ken didn‚Äôt bring the patriarchy to Barbieland. He brought what he THOUGHT was patriarchy but it was actually a sort of innocent misunderstood idea of masculinity. He basically brought with him the idea that horses and beer are awesome. And he even has that line where he says ‚Äúonce I realized the patriarchy didn‚Äôt have anything to do with horses I lost interest.‚Äù So I don‚Äôt understand why the Barbie‚Äôs are brainwashed as if the Kens brought a diabolical plague. It also lends to my first comment. I don‚Äôt see how the mom‚Äôs speech would be helpful to them when the Barbies haven‚Äôt actually experienced any of the paradoxes she‚Äôs talking about. 
3) I disagree with the people who think it‚Äôs anti man. I actually thought the scene where Ken has that montage moment and sees all these great moments in history that had to with men is a positive-masculinity moment. Nothing he saw was bad. It was all wholesome guy stuff. And I think it was clear from the movie that the way Ken is treated in Barbieland is sad and not the ideal.
4) one of the most touching moments to me was when Barbie talks with Ruth at the table. In my mind, Ruth is basically Barbie‚Äôs mom. In that scene we saw how amidst all the chaos and confusion Barbie has, she finds comfort and peace in having tea with her mom. And when Ruth says ‚Äúyou look different‚Äù and Barbie says ‚ÄúUsually I look perfect‚Äù and Ruth says ‚ÄúI think you look just right.‚Äù I thought that was so beautiful and I totally cried. 
5) I wish they would‚Äôve delved into the mom‚Äôs depression a bit more. The mom playing with Barbie to deal with depression and anxiety amidst her ever-changing life and distance from her daughter is a really interesting plot point but they didn‚Äôt flesh it out a whole lot. It gets brushed aside and I guess resolved without any real work being done? 

I have lots of thoughts floating around but these are the ones that are at the top of my brain. So overall, I really enjoyed the movie. I think in some ways it was trying to do too much and that‚Äôs where my criticism comes from.",2023-07-31

I feel like I was too tired and emotionally not in the right headspace to really get into the Barbiesphere.

I'm seeing it again next weekend with my sister, just Barbie by itself. I think I'll really enjoy the experience a lot more. Robbie and especially Gosling's acting was superb, and I think the pacing will seem a little more even and the jokes will land a little better.

"Fairly brilliant film, in my opinion. We've been hit with a glut of meta-narrative films over the past few years and they're rarely done this well. 

I do like that one of the main narratives of this film is that the ""patriarchy"" isn't really good for anyone. It's not great for Ken, and it's not certainly not great for the Allen's of the world that don't necessarily fit in to the Ken archetype.",2023-07-23

Otherwise, absolutely loved this movie. Lived up to the hype for me. The whole theatre was in fits at ""Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast to make this point.""",2023-07-21
"Not sure how the humour would be seen overseas - I‚Äôm from Australia where SNL is seen as both representative of USA humour but also seen as one of the lamest forms of comedy tbh

I was in a packed theatre for Barbie - some of the jokes were a hoot and really well done (and very smart; eg depression barbie, narrator speaking over Barbie‚Äôs insecurities, Barbie acting stiff like a doll; a lot of other jokes felt flat and to a quiet audience here. Interesting to see if the praise for the comedy is a US only phenomenon.",2023-07-21
"I think there were too much ideas and plot lines that made the film a bit messy and unfocused. I am not sure if it was done on purpose. 

I personally think this film is sad. I didn‚Äôt feel happy  or delighted after the film. For me personally it shows that both worlds are not perfect - they are perfect either JUST for Kens/men or JUST for Barbies/women. Kens didn‚Äôt know other way then just become basically Barbies excluding them. And at the end it‚Äôs all staying the same in both worlds with a little hope however. But still both worlds remained imperfect and seemingly unchanged. Still no balance found. 

Like in the past women were seen as with no interests, other then to please men, same goes with Kens. Ken was exited that he can read about horses, and linked it to patriarchy, because he wasn‚Äôt allowed to have any interests in the Barbieland. 

I disagree that this film is anti-male. You expect that CEO is a bad guy, but he‚Äôs just ok, he‚Äôs just doing his job and has some good motives. When Kens fought they ended up supporting each other. Yet I would love to see how the patriarchy affects men in negative way as well (basically also being perfect, on the top, not expressing emotions, loneliness, etc), and also to show that some Barbies would gladly be with Kens (it did show it at end but briefly, it was not enough for me) that being a powerful woman doesn‚Äôt exclude being with the man if she wants it, and that being a powerful Ken is totally okay too. But at least it showed that if you‚Äôre a man and are not on the top it‚Äôs okay too. 

Alan was a great guy because he was the only person who was balanced, he was happy where he is, was just minding his own business and when everything went wrong he was just done with everything. He was the only guy who was supporting Barbie while still being kenough. 

But I wanted to escape reality with this film. But  there‚Äôs no fairytale, just (bitter) reality.",2023-07-21
"I'm seeing people calling Ken a villain, but was he really that? I saw it more like he was living a life where the world was completely ruled by women and men were secondary , but then he understood that it hadn't to be like that, so he tried to inverse it. The problem was that instead of learning from his experience and making everyone the same, he made it the completely inverse, where men ruled and women were secondary. Then again the Barbies do the EXACT same as Ken did, taking the complete control of Barbieland. I know, Barbies took control teaching the other Barbies, but then instead of trying to use that knowledge to try to talk it and reach a conclusion, they use it to trick the Kens and make only the Barbies vote. Kens didn't even use force to get Barbieland, they just learnt from the Blonde Ken and used that to control Barbieland, but since at that time the Barbies couldn't argue with that they won. So at the end, the Kens will live in the original Barbieland, but now with some more rights. What I think is that neither the Barbies or Kens were villains, they were just trying to fight for the best for themselves, but they never learnt from their situation so they got stuck in the same problem over and over.

At least that's what I think, what do you guys think?",2023-07-22

"I loved the first part of the movie but honestly the whole Ken plot line just lost me near the middle and end. Everything felt so spelled out for me, especially the speech.
I feel like it would have made more sense if Barbie took Ferrera to Barbieland as it is with the female president and female Nobel winners and for Ferrera to still feel inadequate or even more inadequate. I feel like it would have pinned down the point they were trying to make about the ‚Äúnormal barbie‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt need to be everything to be amazing. 

Like Barbie thought she would fix Ferreras complex feelings of grief and plainness by showing her all of these really successful images of Barbie like ‚Äúhey women can be everything and anything isn‚Äôt this super uplifting??‚Äù And for Ferrera to respond how I think most women in that state of feeling like they‚Äôre failing at being perfect and plastic, which is even more depressed and inadequate. I thought it was gonna be more metaphorical to how women feel looking at social media with influencers. Instead it became about Ken and fixing all these perfect women in Barbieland and didn‚Äôt really feel impactful on the real world. Although that‚Äôs just my opinion, But I guess as someone who relates more to Ferrera than Barbie, it felt like her storyline ended kind of incomplete.

I mean I think it was impactful for a lot of women, which is important. I did hear some people crying in Ferreras speech. I personally cried during the part where Barbie is sitting on the bench with the old lady. But yeah I just didn‚Äôt love the ending. I know everyone else did.",2023-07-23

I also appreciated that Mattell more or less poked fun at itself as the bad guys, and acknowledges that both product and company are not without some level of fault. Nice touch that they included a bit of history with Ruth Handler, not even shying away from her mastectomy and legal issues.

All in all, definitely worth a rewatch.",2023-07-23

Not to oversimplify, but I felt that Barbieland is introduced as a world with flipped gender roles (barbies control everything and ken do nothing but try to get barbies attention), then they declare that patriarchy is bad, and then it ends with Barbies undermining the Kens to reestablish their matriarchy. The only difference is that now Ken has intrinsic self worth (though no real role, home, or representation in society) and Stereotypical Barbie completes her maturity by converting from a barbie to a human.

However, I will respect this movie for taking a lot of risks, like making a kids franchise PG-13, depicting sexual harassment, and directly calling out the CEO's of the brand it was about. Regardless of the message, taking a glorified toy commercial and doing something interesting with it is a win imo",2023-08-18
"This is was a damn clever movie. 

It was three movies- one for women to validate their experiences, and one for men- one has probably come the closest I've ever seen to giving a sense of the inequities that women face. The number of people who felt uncomfortable when the Kens were offered a lesser role in the Barbieland government proved the point for sure. 

The one thing I kinda thought was forced was America's brief speech about all the contradictions women face in a society. It just felt wedged in and and turned into a convenient plot device- like they ran out of ideas on how to incorporate the messaging. It was a really important message that kinda didn't get it's time to sink in before jumping to the next major plot point.",2023-08-27

"Just finally watched it. I get that the whole idea of Barbie is catered towards girls, female empowerment, etc. And that's fine. But I feel like the underlying message of the move is so representative of what I dislike about the \[extreme\] feminist movement.

At the start of the movie, women are in total control of Barbie land (obviously). When the Kens take over, it is seen as bad and we need to get back to the original arrangement where Barbies rule everything. Obviously, patriarchy is a bad thing but the idea that matriarchy is the solution is just the exact same problem, but reversed. This is what led the Kens to rebel when Ryan Gosling comes back after having tasted male empowerment in the real world. He wants that because he has zero power in Barbie land. When the Barbies take back control, a few of the Kens even ask for a seat in the supreme court or whatever (i.e., asking for equality), and the President just flat out denies them (they ultimately settle for lower court positions I think).

The takeaway/lessons learned from the Ken perspective is that Ken is his own individual, and he need not be defined by the ""And Ken"" stereotype in which his sole purpose in life is to be merely an afterthought/sidekick to Barbie. And that's a great message, but it gets overshadowed by the other message which is that a righteous and just society is one where women are in control. That's delusional. There should be gender equality, but that concept never even comes up (unless I missed it at the end).

"How does everyone interpret the creator's final quote?
_‚ÄúWe mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they've come.‚Äù_

I'm not a native English speaker, but I see many people on Twitter saying it basically means the mother stops everything to live though her daughter, is this what it actually means? Or is it open to interpretation?

Because I thought it was sort of a double entendre on the feminist cause. Ruth created Barbie to inspire little girls to be what they really want to be, and now her daughter barbie doesn't want to just inspire but actually help on the field.

I felt like it meant that past to a certain point, the first generation of women fighting for gender equality needs to let the next one do it, as they will be outgrown by their own cause. They might not understand this new generation's take on their fight, but it is probably because they did their part and have achieved progress.

"As much as I hate to say this, I left the theater feeling a bit disappointed. Overall, I did like it, but there are some things I would have changed plot-wise that I feel would have greatly improved and cleared up the message of the movie (see below).

**PROS**   
\* The acting   
\* The amazing Barbieland sets  
\* Superb costuming   
\* The ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù that it was the mother‚Äôs memories, not the daughter‚Äôs  
\* Ken realizing he is Kenough without Barbie  
\* The inclusion of Weird Barbie (we all had her)  
\* Humor, and Mattel‚Äôs self-deprecating humor  


  
**CONS**   
\* No plot got to be explored or resolved the way it deserved because there were too many to tackle. (Matriarchy vs. Patriarchy, Mattel Executives, Barbie wanting to be human, Mom and daughter conflict)  
\* The ending (multiple aspects of it)  
\* Sasha‚Äôs (the tween girl) character was insufferable for me personally. Too intense and cold (bullying Barbie and calling her a fascist at age 12)

Things I would have changed about the plot:

1. Focus primarily on the **plot of Barbie wanting to be human**, and Matriarchy vs. Patriarchy as the secondary plot. The movie ends with Barbie wanting to be human, but we only got one scene at the beginning of the movie where she takes in Real World‚Äôs humanness. In fact, in the middle part of the movie, all she wants is things to go back to how they were before she visited Real World, because everything was perfect. Her humanness is never mentioned again until the last 5 minutes of the movie. In my opinion, this should have been the primary plot of the film and could have been explored SO deeply using the theme *‚ÄúBarbie (even though she is perfect) sees how imperfectly perfect humans are, and wants to feel what they feel despite it being messy sometimes.‚Äù* This also would have gone hand-in-hand with the Mom‚Äôs speech about the trials of being a woman, and her suggestion of an Ordinary Woman Barbie. Because women are not perfect despite the standards set, but there is beauty in the mess/realness - just like Barbie realizes (and decides she wants randomly in the last 5 minutes).
2. I wish they ended the movie with the Barbies and Kens realizing that **Matriarchy and Patriarchy are both not ideal**, because either Barbies or Kens will always feel less-than and under appreciated. In this day and age, *why are we not promoting more togetherness*? There was a great opportunity at the end for President Barbie to give Kens a valuable role in government, but it is quickly shot down. Then, there were comments from Barbies along the lines of ‚Äúthey have to start somewhere‚Äù and ‚Äúthey will have as much power as women do in the Real World.‚Äù I get the point they were trying to make, but still think it was a HUGE missed opportunity to promote men and women both seeing each other as valuable and having innate worth within society.
3. In the last scene of the movie, I was expecting Barbie to be interviewing for a job or something. Her being at a gynecologist was funny, but I would have also loved for us to see her **earning a high position on Mattel‚Äôs board** and introducing Ordinary Woman Barbie, or something along those lines - after all, she did say she doesn‚Äôt want to BE the idea, she wants to be the one creating the ideas! Also, the point of Barbie is that women can do anything and wear pink, heels, and be divinely feminine while doing it. At the end of the film in the Real World, she is wearing beige and Birkenstocks. What a statement it would have been to see her being a girlboss in the real world while still totally owning her love of pink, especially since at the beginning of the movie, she is against the Birkenstocks that Weird Barbie wants her to try.
4. Lastly, the whole movie is about how the patriarchal Real World is awful compared to Barbieland. Then, when Barbieland is turned into a patriarchal society by the Kens, the Barbies hate it and devise a plan to overthrow it, and they succeed. But at the end, **does Barbie just forget everything she fought for** in Barbieland when she turns into a human and essentially enters the man-run world she worked so hard to fix? At the end, it would have been great to have Barbie indicate that another reason she wants to turn human is to **help Real World women** gain more equality and respect, like she thought had already been accomplished at the beginning of the movie. (so that Real World is more like the Barbieland in my rewritten plot, since the Barbies and Kens respect and value each other as equals)
5. One more note... I would have given the **Kens a bit more substance** than BEACH. It was humorous, but almost saying that Barbies are in charge simply because the Kens have infant brains with no thoughts whatsoever. In reality though, we should be portraying the message that Barbies are in charge because of THEIR intelligence, leadership skills, etc. instead of Ken‚Äôs lack thereof.

Things I felt were unnecessary to the plot:

1. The **Mattel Executives** should have gotten less screen time, or should have helped move the plot forward in some way. There was really no purpose for them despite chasing Barbie around. And once they got to Barbieland, they were also pretty useless. Maybe they could have helped the Barbies and Kens work out their issues since they *literally created them.*
2. The **mother and daughter conflict** honestly didn‚Äôt add much to the story for me. There wasn't any development there. And, like I said before (and it could just be me) the daughter‚Äôs character was too much and so disrespectful. It would have been the same story if they didn‚Äôt have such a bad relationship, and the mom started playing with Barbie again just because she was *mourning the loss of her daughter‚Äôs childhood* as she transitions into a young woman. This ‚Äúmourning the loss of the childhood‚Äù could have also been the explanation of Barbie‚Äôs death thoughts.

Again, I did like the movie but think it could have been better and more meaningful. I love reading everyone else's thoughts on it too.",2023-07-24
"I saw it last night and loved it. 

My only note is that at the end, she introduced herself as Barbara Handler, the last name of the creator of the doll (and full name of the daughter she was named after)‚Ä¶but Barbie‚Äôs full name has always been Barbara Millicent Roberts. I thought it would have been a better nod to use the Roberts last name.",2023-07-21

‚ÄúYou gotta tell them you‚Äôve never seen The Godfather‚Äù was hilarious watching it with my husband since he begged me to watch the Godfather when he found out I haven‚Äôt seen it hahahah,2023-07-22
"It needed an extra twenty or thirty minutes. The entire human subplot was so bare bones that we hardly got to know them or spend time with them. The daughter changed her tune in the snap of a finger. And Barbie, although she self-actualizes, never found her personality. It was like the entire movie was her realizing she wanted to become a human, but yet we never saw her become a person. Who Barbie is, I still don‚Äôt feel like I know. Meanwhile, Ken is the one character fully fleshed out. His entire arc worked, but it overtook Barbie‚Äôs own arc, and I think the movie suffers because of it. With some extra runtime, a few more jokes, some actual time with the mom and daughter, and a bit of personality building for Barbie, I think this could‚Äôve been perfect instead of just really good. But no one would ever green light a 2.5 hour Barbie movie.",2023-07-22
"This movie was the best kind of ridiculous!

I had a smile on my face for pretty much nearly all of it.

The over-the-topness of Barbieland and its characters just captivated me, some great humor and I was thoroughly entertained.

Great day at the cinema!",2023-07-22
"I liked the movie a lot. I loved what it attempted to accomplish. But, the execution felt a bit clumsy.

They screwed up by making Ken the more active protagonist of the story. Ken has a very clear ""want"" whereas Barbie never even really even accepts her call to action. Ken wants something easy to understand and more easily relateable. It's incredibly dangerous to give a completely powerless character in society the drive to increase their status. Throw in a few music and dance numbers and the audience is going to get on board.

Barbie is set up as an antagonist, (wants to maintain the status quo) or at the very least her wants are much less clear than Ken's. She wants to rid herself of the societal anxiety that comes with simply existing as a woman. While that makes a good point, it is held onto until near the end of the movie and is used more as a reveal than her driving force.",2023-07-23
"This is a small thing but my favorite joke was,  after she realized she can't be mad at Barbie dolls anymore,  the daughter immediately pivoted to claiming that her dad trying to learn a second language is 'appropriation.' She just had to take up a cause, didn't matter how little sense it made.",2023-07-23

"While I mostly really liked this movie, there was scene towards the end that put a little bit of bad taste in my mouth. I felt it was weird that when Ken was crying it was played for laughs, especially contrasted with how sincerely Barbies‚Äô crying scene was. It felt like it undermined a lot of the films message about gender roles and emotional vulnerability.",2023-07-24
"I don't think this movie was necessarily just about sexism and I've seen a lot of people saying this movie is anti-men. I think it does a good job of showing you that patriarchy is bad for EVERYONE. Barbie obviously had it rough when she goes into the real world and sees that it's not the same as Barbie land and has a crisis when she learns of all the things women have to go through and how hard we have it (being sexually assaulted and objectified within minutes of arriving in the Real World and then being arrested for defending herself when that one guy slaps her arse. Even the police at the station were objectifying her and brushing off her very real and very upsetting experience that nearly every single woman will have gone through at some point in their life and somehow they're blamed for wearing something too revealing or leading a man on, or being too drunk...). Meanwhile, Ken lands in the real world and is immediately given the respect he's been missing in Barbie Land. And so he's brainwashed into thinking the Patriarchy is the best thing ever and just goes along with it even though he doesn't really understand it. It made me think of little boys who were raised by a Man's Man who go on to have the same values as their fathers even if they don't really understand why.",2023-07-27
"People in the comments aren't realising that painting gender relations as a zerosum game is a hyperbole and satire, and Feminists don't see the world like that, but for some women it can feel like that. It is NOT A WAR between men and women",2023-07-31
"So I just got back from Barbie 2023 my most anticipated movie of the year. And i didn't just like it...I loved it. I love this movie. I don't even know how to describe it in words without spoiling it, it's one of those movies tou just have to see for yourself to believe. Not only because it's extremely funny and also the flawless set design of Barbieland. But also the film goes surprisingly heavy and existential in its themes, and I think men need to see this movies as well, because I see people online claim this movie is ""Anti-Men"" that is dishonest and a lie in every sense of the word. 

If anything, the film is Pro-Gender Equality, as the film basically deals with womanhood and how truly hard it is to be a woman in this world, and why they should be treated as equals, and the film hits the point hard, allowing the dramatic moments to hit even harder. It's also anti-Toxic Masculinity and shows that men shouldn't be acting like sexist jerks, as that doesn't make look ""strong"" or ""cool"" at all. So yeah, anyone who says the film is ""Anti-Men"" is wrong, and like I said, the film handles its actual themes of Pro-Gender Equality and Anti-Toxic Masculinity brilliantly, and I love how this film gets heavy even when it didn't need too. 

But make no mistake, the film is still a comedy. And man oh man, does comedy land extremely well. I am into very weird humor, and this film is exactly that and I love it. It had made laughing quite a few times, one sequence in particular involving Will Ferrells character was probably the funniest in the whole movie, however I will not spoil it. Also the performance were great as well. Overall, fantastic movie, that everyone needs to go and see. 10/10.",2023-08-15

It felt like a kids movie lol. Which like - duh. It's *Barbie.* But the way so many people out there were just piling on accolades - I guess I thought it'd be more complex than it was. 

It's probably because most films don't have the characters just straight out say ""this is what I mean"" but it felt very odd to have every character be as cartoon-ishly stereotypical as possible.

It was a cute little movie and has a lot of nostalgia attached to it but I don't think it should have garnered the title of ""highest grossing film of 2023"" tbh.",2023-12-17

"I knew this movie would be talking about some deep stuff but the beginning felt like a pyschological horror. The fragile utopian society, Barbie just casually bringing up thinking of death (it feels like she's been experiencing this for awhile and we just saw a part of it).  
Honestly Im just amazed how many shots it took with Mattel and Mattel just allowed it.

But some of those jokes were *insane*. Like Depression Barbie and Issa Rae Barbie calling Ken a motherfucker (they shouldve used their one f-bomb pass but whatever),

IK there's a lot of parents complaining about it not being for kids, but like have you SEEN kids nowadays. The jokes they make and the things they say are completely typical for them. I also think its important for anyone to see of any age or gender. Sexualization waits for no one. Many little girls who watched that movie have dealt with objectification. Educating them to stick up for themselves and not conform to a world not made for them is good. Also little boys can learn from Ken that not every attraction they feel from a girl is mutual and they aren't owed anything and building up empathy towards their female peers. 

Another thing is how this and Nimona (another ""kids"" movie I watched reccently, like yesterday) and this movie could have ended their stories at the 1 hr mark like a lesser movie would; The percieved problem is solved and everyone gets their happily ever after. And stretching that out to reach the 1 hr 30 min mark. But they instead dig deeper. Barbie could have just helped out Gloria, learned that she doesnt need to be perfect, roll credits. No, its Barbie also starts to have an exstitential crisis, Ken has his own exstiential crisis which leads to him attempting to establish the patriarchy, Barbie encourages Ken to be his own person, and Barbie becomes her own person. 

Also the movie ending where she meets her gynecologist is so fucking funny I can't-",2023-07-26

The audience and I cheered at some of the scenes. It was great. Such a well thought out and meaningful movie about equality and what it means to be human. Loved it. Will watch again and I'd love to read the script for some scenes.",2023-08-08
My pet peeve about something that happens in TV or movies are when it's super obvious when cast members aren't filming together for a scene. I do understand why in movies like this with a huge cast filled with well known actresses and actors but the director and cast should be good enough to not make it obvious. But it was so obvious in this movie and it bothers me a lot.,2023-11-20
"Just watched the movie yesterday and I don't get the big deal.  
I thought the movie was funny at some times and self-aware enough not to be cringe.  
The story was mid at best, nothing in the real world actually mattered, and the CEO character was pretty weak. If I'm going to be harsh, I'd say the fact that they needed to get some middle-aged woman and her daughter take her back to Barbie land and get her to explain everything because the character of barbie was too stupid to come to any conclusions on their own. Everyone also talks about the crazy hard feminist messaging, but all I saw were some pretty surface level takes (Cat calling is bad, women should be CEO, women should be president) and sometimes even that was pretty questionable, like when they showed us how men were more prone to aggression, but then the kens fought for 5 minutes sang about there feelings and became friends again like they couldn't just overthrow the government the day after. At the end of the movie I thought now will come the time when the women take a stand and decide not to go back to the matriarchy because they understood that it was unethical, but instead they just went back to matriarchy for 90% giving us the message that women and men are actually just as bad as the other will always choose to get on top instead of equality and cant be held accountable for anything. I'm not trying to say that the movie was secretly made by women  hating Hollywood stars, I just think it was made by a cringe corporation who wanted to make wide claims on politics without standing on anything, and it shows Mate is shown as a woman loving corporation who is the worst written antagonist ever. I also read that a lot of women cried at the end of the movie because barbie had a mother daughter talk with the old lady, and it feels so cringe, it basically said: ""hey barbie I'm your mo now even though you don't know me and have never made even the slightest effort to be in your life once, but I want to tell you that I love you, and you can become a human now bye forever.""  
TLDR; it's an oke movie with some laughs, everyone who thinks this is even close to extreme feminism does not know what feminism is about.",2024-01-19
"I personally didn‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm a woman who grew up with Barbie and I was disappointed. 

At the beginning of the movie I thought it was super fun and interesting the set and world was great. While I loved seeing Barbie and the world but as a character I actually immediately related to Ken. Especially when they went to the real world and someone asked him the time and he was so happy to be seen as important enough to be asked what time it is. I had a moment where my teacher asked me to help him move some boxes with some other students. Usually they always ask the guys but I‚Äôm being treated the same. I know it‚Äôs small but when you‚Äôre treated less than based on your gender it‚Äôs important to you. 

So I knew that Ken would go overboard and that hopefully the message would be no one should be treated as less than to make the other persons life better and that Kens and Barbie‚Äôs would both be happy but that‚Äôs not what happened. 

Kens moment where he cries that he is nothing without Barbie is seen for laughs which makes me sad. I‚Äôve seen so many women be raised with that idea and be so lost with themselves when they realize they don‚Äôt need to think and act that way. That making it for a joke just because it‚Äôs a male character upset me. 

I also had a problem with the negatives of Barbie being said in a small speech but then they never really explained it resolved in any way. They just shifted the focus to stopping the Kens without acknowledging hey yeah Barbie can have flaws and be negative to women too. 

I loved that they tried to explain the patriarchy I have no problem with social commentary or political stuff in movies and I‚Äôm all for explaining how women are put down but this movie kind of ruins it‚Äôs own points with the way they treat the Kens. 

Especially at the end when they ask to have at least one spot on the Supreme Court and the president says no they can have a smaller less important role. Then the narrator says the kens would ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù and would eventually get more power but just enough that women have in the real world. The way it‚Äôs said implies kens deserve less power because they‚Äôre incompetent which is a point men have been saying about women for ages‚Ä¶ just because it‚Äôs said about men does not make the point less sexist or wrong. Your gender has nothing to do with how you handle power and being a leader. This also implies that for women in the real world it never gets better for them.

There are also other smaller things politically I thought could be handled better as well as general movie things such as pacing and some characters being useless but that was my main issue with the movie. I really wanted to like it more than I did since I love Barbie and grew up with it but I was disappointed.",2023-07-22
"Am I the only one who was kind of dissapointed with the movie? It was a bit immature for adults but too mature for kids, tbh for me it was a bit overhyped and kind of boring
Sorry",2023-07-21
"People complain about this movie being heavy-handed.

And yet, there are post in this thread about thinking that the movie's message was: ""*Real life should be a matriarchy*""",2023-07-23
This should be the most obvious production design oscar win of all time. Truly incredible what they did with Barbieland.,2023-07-23
"I'll be honest...it was kind of a weird movie to me. It was a fun ride but like someone else had posted there were times in the movie it felt preachy and out of place. There were funny scenes and the set was wonderful but some things went on too long like when they got too talkative and serious. They need scenes like that, I get it....but they did not need to be so long. I love sending a message but the America Ferrera speech could have been cut a bit, it went on too long to where the fun-ness of the movie kinda stalled. And she had one weird speech, I forget what it was about but it was after they found out the Kens were taking over Barbieland and the Barbies were brainwashed. She said something weird and out of place and too serious but I forget what it was. Her daughter was a little too much. A brat and then in typical cheesy fashion all of a sudden she falls hardcore into it ""lets save barbie, mom lets do this for you, I love you mom type behavior after being so angsty. It seemed not genuine. She could have played that down a bit. And the daughters speech to Barbie while she was with her friends was pretty cheesy too. And the speech with Ruth and Barbie at the end. I get they had to include an emotional punch but that just took the sails right out of the hype of how the movie had been going. There was dancing and chaos going then that quiet one on one speech slowed everything down and they still had another scene to go! The speech / talk between Ruth and Barbie went on entirely too long to where I was like wow what a buzzkill. They could have made that more simple and shorter. If all those things were cut out of the movie, this movie would be fun and funny and cute and not guilty of trying so hard to be progressive. I think progressive is good but I cringe when it's performative.",2023-07-31
"I absolutely loved this movie. I was a bit put off by the opening sequence, but after 5 to 10 minutes of weirdness I leaned into the whole absurdist vibe and started to really enjoy myself. The over-the-top hyper-feminine perfection of BarbieLand, the tongue in cheek narration and musical score, the sheer goofiiness of the Kens that capture the ""just guys being dudes"" attitude in the best way I've ever seen on television. Yeah, the plot doesn't make sense, but who cares? It's no more absurd than the latest Marvel capeshit and is a perfectly acceptable excuse to tell a funny story about female emancipation.

I thought the monologue that everyone loves to quote was a bit preachy and over the top (it is not ""literally impossible"" to be a woman) and only served as a disservice to the film's message, and the Ruth / Barbie conversation about how to be human was a bit dragged out which sort of left me feeling that the real movie ended about 10 minutes before the credits rolled, but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed myself.",2023-07-31
"Overall pretty good, but way too preachy. 

The constant pointing things out was unnecessary and implies they think the audience is too stupid to figure out (very common in Hollywood nowadays). Kids even pick up on subtlety so it really just pulls you out of the movie, killing the suspension of disbelief.

So a few scenes talking about the patriarchy + Barbie not-so-subtly talking about being an object + Ken‚Äôs arc + Gloria‚Äôs speech= way too much 

But with the plot it just amplified things. Then with things like saying nonchalantly that the husband will be fine (with no concern for him) as Gloria & her daughter go to a different world , it just gave off this vibe‚Ä¶

It was good for Ken‚Äôs plot because they addressed it, but with Gloria‚Äôs speech about how she has to do all this and that and worrying constantly, yet we see her unconcerned about her husband when they go into a strange place with no idea when they‚Äôll return‚Ä¶it just felt a little‚Ä¶hypocritical?

I feel like a little editing could‚Äôve fixed that.

I wish they put more focus on the script, mainly with making a couple scenes more subtle, and especially with the Mattel board. 

With that said, the acting was really good from everyone, set design was fantastic. The intro was really funny & fun.

Ryan was hilarious. 
IMO his parts were the best parts of the movie. Several scenes I noticed he did little details like shake his fists for a few seconds when he was struggling with what he felt or he did this little tilt of his head which made him seem more doll like. Just amazing.
 
Great choreography of the dance & musical numbers‚Ä¶and of course the fight scene was great. There were a ton of things going on at once. My friend noticed things I didn‚Äôt & vice versa (like a Ken giving CPR to a stick-horse lol)

So really good movie but I think people forget that if you go too hard with inserting life lessons & preaching, it kills the fun. 

(Not to mention turns people who are sick of being talked down to, off from watching the movie). 

And here, it probably would‚Äôve taken a few minor changes to take a pretty good movie to make a flawless one.",2023-09-25
"Unironically, this film totally got what it means to be a woman in a world where every imperfection is used against you. 

Barbie is about discovering your place, your identity in a world that wants to put you in a box. It‚Äôs about the conundrums and contradictions of femininity and the aching feeling of being judged to impossible standards. 

Its about the complexity of consciousness and the relationships we build with simple thoughts and actions that can last a wonderful lifetime. And that is what it means to be human in a world that‚Äôs always changing.

And a line that really stood out to me was, ‚Äúmothers stand still, so daughters can look back and see how far they‚Äôve comel‚Äù. Like god what a line. 

It was genuinely so amazing to see everyone all dressed up in pink and being excited for the movie. I saw my classmates all show in Barbie hats, pink shorts, and pink shirts. They‚Äôre all also guys so it was cool of them to do that. I saw people in pink cowboy hats, and I just saw all of us being happy.",2023-07-21
"I haven‚Äôt seen anyone really touch on this, but to those frustrated by the ending and a lack of actual representation for the Kens, I think the frustration is supposed to be the point. Men don‚Äôt really feel the effects of the sloowwwww churn of progress for women. The suffrage movement was in the 20s and [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/when-could-women-open-a-bank-account/#:~:text=It%20wasn't%20until%201974,a%20signature%20from%20their%20husbands), ‚ÄúIt wasn't until 1974, when the Equal Credit Opportunity Act passed, that women in the U.S. were granted the right to open a bank account on their own. Technically, women won the right to open a bank account in the 1960s, but many banks still refused to let women do so without a signature from their husbands.‚Äù

So you go through allllllllll this hard work and seemingly monumental effort and at the end of it, you‚Äôve only moved an inch. And it‚Äôs good you moved that inch, but damn is there a long way to go.  And I don‚Äôt think Barbie is saying that is okay. It‚Äôs just saying this is how it‚Äôs been and firmly places this shitty experience into the shoes of the men watching who may understand, but never really placed themselves in that position before(okay I mean there is a whole conversation of marginalized groups like LGBTQ and racial groups who DO understand and experience this, so it isn‚Äôt a 1 to 1, but this is talking on the strict gender binary that Barbie is presenting)",2023-07-24
"I've been thinking more and idk I just don't love how they portrayed gender relations as some zero sum game, even if it was done tongue and cheek it was just kind of off to me.



Like I feel like they dove head first into the kind of stereotypes that feminists have had to work hard to shake off. Saying that ""gender relations have been solved"" when the only thing that has been ""solved"" is that now men are the ones oppressed just seems weird. Most real feminists would say that men are oppressed by patriarchy as well and that the goal of equality is a society where it's not ""Barbies House"" or ""Ken's House"".... But one where everyone has a house. Yet the movie ends where it began, with Ken back to just being homeless I guess and with the Barbies just not caring. As if the only state the movie can imagine is one where one gender has to have dominance over the other.



Also this is only kind of related but for some reason the jokes with that Dad character just seemed so mean spirited to me. Like, ""Hey look at this stupid asshole trying hard to learn a second language so he can communicate with his wife and daughter in their native language, what a dumbass let's laugh at him."" Just seemed like a weird thing to make fun of a character over.",2023-07-31

This movie perfectly mixed in the drama with the comedy too. Some moments hit pretty deep and had my theater crying. The part with Barbie at the bus stop with the old lady was absolutely beautiful. 

Everyone did a wonderful job acting in this. This was perfected casted and everyone was perfect. 

Fuck, the music was perfect. Was that Lizzo singing the wake up song? That was so funny and catchy. I liked sooooo many of the songs in this.

WEIRD BARBIE FTW,2023-07-26
"I liked this movie on the surface - it's cute, funny enough to have laugh moments throughout and altogether not too deep. I didn't go in to the cinema expecting it to be something totally amazing tbf. 

To start with there were a number of things that I felt were not very fleshed out;

- like the mother-daughter relationship which could have had more of an emotional aspect to the film instead of being very brief and forgettable.

-  America Ferrera's depression is also mentioned, but not delved into and why her issues affected Barbie so severely in Barbieland. They just go right over America's drawings having to do with death which sounded pretty dark.

- Unfortunately those things are just never developed once they all leave the real world - America Ferrera and Barbie are supposed to be just fine without totally addressing the depression and flat feet. America and her daughter also just end getting along fine with no explanation or anything to show why they did.
 
- Re. The teenage daughter, it's surprising she somehow comes round to the idea of stereotypical Barbie despite feeling the complete opposite for ""fascist"" Barbie just shortly before.

- And further the status of the Ken's at the end, still left without their own homes and still struggling since they are not totally 'equal' to the Barbies. 

üëÜ I would have enjoyed seeing Barbie staying in Barbieland to work on making the Barbies and Kens equal - but maybe that is what a sequel will be about. It would be interesting to see Barbie living in the real world learning to adjust to life as a real woman ""now having a vagina,"" whilst helping to make things equal in Barbieland.",2023-08-02
"In my friend group people either said they hated it or they liked it 'cause its important', but not that they necessarily enjoyed it. Only one of em said they loved it, but their reasoning was the same. When I saw it in the theater nobody was laughing. I'm still scratching my head over how it did so well. Can't all have been the marketing.",2023-08-10
"My wife and I went to see ""Barbie"" again this weekend, and to our renewed joy, it was just as much fun as the first time, probably more so because I wasn't laughing so hard that I missed as many lines!  
  
When Barbie sits down at the bus stop, takes a moment to look at the real world and start to digest what she's seeing, she looks over at the old woman and recognizes her beauty.  
  
I loved this because it's true that older people are beautiful, but it also reflects that even Barbieland, they are aware of age and death in the real world, which could partially explain Barbie's recent thoughts about dying.  
  
""You are so beautiful.""  
  
""I know!""  
  
This moment of acknowledgment, recognition, and connection just captivated me, and I really, REALLY wanted them to exchange just a few more lines. Something small but very zen that would be a succinct but powerful expression of the themes of the film and Barbie's journey.  
  
But perhaps Gerwig and Baumbach thought that might be too much?  
  
What do you think?  
  
Was less actually more here?",2023-09-14

However, at the end of the movie, 1) Barbie realized she wasn't perfect, she has flaws. 2)  Ken DON'T just do beach, but the females are giving the men more important higher level jobs in Barbieland. That's saying Love and Respect to the men, not men-hating!",2023-07-23

"I hate that I didn‚Äôt love this movie, I was so excited for it. I‚Äôm a woman that played with Barbies as a little girl & a feminist that loves nothing more than a rich story about female empowerment. I just did not enjoy this movie beyond the first 20-30 or so minutes. The messaging felt so heavy handed, like to me there was nothing subtle or nuanced about this movie. 

The way they approached certain topics fell so flat for me. Over & over they referenced ‚Äúthe patriarchy‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure that young 13 year old girls & boys (using 13 since the movie is technically PG13) are going to walk away from this movie really understanding what that means & how living in a patriarchal society impacts their lives & their futures. They talked a lot about it without actually saying anything at all. 

I think Barbie experiencing the real world would have been a better focus for the movie. Having her experience the world as we know it & how it often feels to be a woman in our world (I thought they were going in that direction when she interacted with those construction workers but that didn‚Äôt really go anywhere). & show Ken also experiencing that same world as a contrast. 

Have her really bond with that mother & daughter & connect with them. & learn about their different experiences as a young girl & woman navigating the world. They were such a wasted plot point. When she chose to be human I was like why? She was in the real world for like an hour. What did she experience that made it so appealing? Maybe one thing she realized she‚Äôs missing is true connection with others, maybe she wants to help make the world a better place for that teenage girl she‚Äôd grown to love. That would have been a beautiful journey for her & a way to discuss feminism with some nuance. 

I‚Äôve seen a couple people comparing this movie to Legally Blonde & saying Legally Blonde did it better. I‚Äôd agree. Legally Blonde was colorful & sparkly & feminine but also empowering & it‚Äôs messaging was subtle but impactful. I was actually only 9 years old when Legally Blonde came out but I saw it in theaters & I still remember walking out of that theater thinking ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶I could go to Harvard one day too. I could be a Lawyer. I could be anything.‚Äù

So yeah, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. I laughed a few times, it was beautiful to look at, & I thought the acting was fine. But I was disappointed & thought there was a lot of wasted potential. I understand the gender-swapping, Barbie Land was a matriarchy & became a patriarchy. I get it. Just did not enjoy it. I did enjoy Alan, though. That gimmick was a trip. 

TLDR; It wasn‚Äôt for me. 6/10",2023-07-23
"I felt like such an Allan at my screening. Lost among a sea of Barbies who don't give a shit about me...

Anyway, this movie was fucking amazing. It's an existential crisis marauding as kids fare, but it's original and completely subversive. I definitely was not expecting it to go places it did, and taking the concept all the way to its logical conclusion. Margot and Ryan were both fantastic in the roles. Reminded me a little bit of Toy Story and a little bit of Elf. I thought the scenes with the mother and daughter were also pretty touching. And of course the fact that Ken become ""toxic"" after only a short visit to the real world. That's definitely some heavy content for a product carrying the Barbie brand. Oh yeah, and the songs were pretty catchy too.

I guess I connected to it in a weird way, based on how shit everything is in this world. It's funny, because I was thinking back to the latest episode of It's Always Sunny last night (""Dennis Takes a Mental Health Day""), and in some ways, this was the perfect parallel. Both of them ended in a kind of transcendental dreamlike wonder. I don't know, I guess I'm pretty fucked up. Definitely wasn't expecting Barbie to be one of my favorite films of 2023, but here we are. (Also the first Greta Gerwig film I thoroughly enjoyed.)

"For a movie so unabashedly about feminism in almost every way, it's insanely ironic that the Ryan Gosling and all the Ken scenes steal the freakin' show and are pretty much all I remember about the movie. It's almost like Margot/Barbie took a back seat in her own movie for most of it, or simply just had the most plain scenes. It didn't help they didn't let her have any character or personality, which is ofcourse the point to a degree, but for everyone around her to be way more fascinating just seems like a strange oversight coming from Greta Gerwig. I'm just imagining all the creative executive meetings and hammering out the script about how Barbie needs more agency, control, and that these things need to lead to on the nose commentary about society that they just simply forgot to give the character any memorable moments outside of the opening sequence. I liked it alot and found it to be very funny, but there's quite a lot of flaws. Will Ferrel went all the way to Barbieland to do...nothing. And the resolution of this movie was like 30 whole minutes, it was ""over"" for quite awhile but then we got a montage for...reasons. Simu was fantastic, I hope we get to see more of him in the sequel. Also wish we got more of Dua Lipa and John Cena. But this movie is gonna be a hit, so hopefully we just get more of everything on the next one. Major props to set design, VFX, costume, and cinematography, this movie was a feast for the eyes.

Everyone was dressed in pink or outlandishly in Barbie themed costume, everyone showed up on time and went to the bathroom prior to the movie beginning, there was no whispered conversations about nonsense or bright glows of cell phones, I didn't even hear a cough or see anyone go down the stairs to leave for a break during the movie, in fact nearly everyone stayed through the credits. We truly joined in on the laughter, the emotions and the music together; and it was that ""the movies were meant to be seen"" shit that actors/directors keep thanking us for.   


Second, I'd like to begin with my questions. How many flippin' types of Barbies are there?! Also, is Margot Robbie the combination of all Stereotypical Barbies, or just one Stereotypical Barbie in a singular Barbieland of potentially infinite Barbielands? What type of Barbie was Kate McKinnon's ""Weird Barbie"" prior to the Weirdening? I did have a criticism on the Mattel board, featuring Will Ferrell's CEO. I'm not really sure what their point was, and if they were meant to serve as anything more than filler. It seems, to me at least, that there was a lot more written and intended there, but given that Mattel was involved it got edited out. In fact, a lot of the consumerism got underplayed, which was an interesting choice. It just seemed like an underutilization of what could've been a fun exploration or plot line.  


Third ...   
Barbieland is just as messed up as Century City. Barbieland is not intended to be written as some sort of utopian dream land we should all aspire to. It's shown as a land of a child's imagination, where there are no complexities and the world just works because it does. While there are probably dozens of Barbies and Kens in Barbieland; I believe there's only one actual Barbie and one Ken. It's not a whole world of women running every corner of government and economy, but one girl believing she can do any job in her world of play and do any career that Mattel sells a costume for. It isn't a sea of Kens just feeling useless on the beach, it's just one doll waiting until that girl is ready to play the happily ever after scene.

I don't think Ken ever understood the patriarchy, I think he just saw a world where Kens had stories of their own. However, he could never execute this because he still needed to be given his story, failing to realize that Barbies are also most likely not free-thinkers (relying on the owner at play), so he filled that void with masculine consumerism, machoism and an attempted coup. Wait, there's a hole in the logic: ""If they're not free-thinkers, how are they able to cross-over and go on this adventure?"" I don't know, it's a freakin' movie, also I feel it's more of a compulsion than decisions, as she just follows where the vision tells her and then other players engage in the decision making going forward really, while she's in crisis mode constantly, until fed inspiration.

I don't know what this Barbie Constitution looks like, I hope one day Nick Cage will steal it for us all to see. However, a government and society that makes an entire group of people a second class, subject to life long servitude, is not a government we should really support (\*ahem\*). I think what a lot of the folks in this thread here don't realize, is that's the whole point. I think maybe a lot of folks only are getting upset about it now because they are seeing themselves in the characters being subjected to the mistreatment; which goes to show how surprisingly effective this movie is. It's not idolizing the Barbie government, it is quite literally saying ""hey, let's stop trying to politicize and govern genders specifically and separately ... also maybe let's try including more people into the fold."" I think the point of Issa Rae's President saying no to a Supreme Court position, but yes to a lower court position, is one: in part to my many barbies, one girl theory and two: and example of how slow moving human society is to progress and no one has been allowed to jump bars that quickly, regardless of when people suddenly take notice of them.  


Third and a Half ...  
I might be a stupid piece of plastic, but those are my simple thoughts leaving the movie theater about a movie that stars Kate McKinnon doing the splits: we don't need to take it as seriously as Far East Foreign Trade Policy if you disagree.   


Fourth ...

I thought it was worth pointing out because I see it as progress that might have gone unnoticed. Ryan Gosling's Ken flirts with Doctor Barbie in this movie, who is played by openly Trans actress Hari Nef. Doctor Barbie isn't ""Trans Doctor Barbie"", there isn't a 20 minute segment about her being Trans, in fact there's no mention of it at all; she is simply a Barbie that's a doctor. I find it very refreshing that stories are hiring LGBTQIA+ folks and not needing to center the reason around their being LGBTQIA+, their characters can just participate in life and society, without being tokenized or traumatized.",2023-07-23
"I really enjoyed this movie. It was silly but not absurd. Funny but not cheap. The acting was great. The set designs and costumes were perfection. The writing was deft. 

However, I have a question. Did we all just watch a two-hour ad for Mattel? I know they sort of portrayed themselves as greedy corporate overlords, but they weren‚Äôt the bad guys in the end. And now I see that they are already capitalizing with merch sales. It doesn‚Äôt ruin the movie for me in the least, but it does leave me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.",2023-07-23
"Part of this is probably due to the fact that it was caught in development hell since 2009, but I think a lot of people's issues with this film can be explained by the fact this is basically two movies smashed together into one. 

The first movie is about Margot's character having an existential crisis, visiting the real world and learning it's not like she imagined, and helping Sasha and her mother reconnect while also finding out who she is, ending with her wanting to become human herself. 

The second movie is about the inequality between Barbies/Kens, how it's basically the inverse of women and men in real life, and one Ken learning about how men are treated in real life and overthrowing Barbie Land with those ideals, forcing the Barbies and Kens to confront the issues with their society and giving a satirical reflection of sexism IRL. 

Both deal with major philosophical themes but I think the movie struggles a bit to fully flesh out and neatly tie up the two storylines within the constraints of a 2 hour runtime. Because of that we get a lot of half baked plotlines (the Mattel execs, Alan kind of just being ""there"") and the resolution of the movie isn't as satisfying as it could be (the Kens are basically back to square one with being oppressed by the barbies' matriarchy). 

I really enjoyed this film a lot. I love the absurd elements, the surreal humor, the focus on existential and philosophical themes. The set design was absolutely gorgeous and I love that it was all practical effects and set pieces too. But I think it could have benefitted from going all in on one of the two plot points outline above rather than trying to fit them both in a two hour move. Much like Margot's barbie in the film I think this movie was struggling to figure out who it really was and never quite got there.",2023-07-23

To me it felt much like something directed at adult women, to the point where young girls in the audience would struggle to connect with what's going on; the early Kubrick parody in the particular is something I imagine young audiences won't be able to understand.",2023-07-23

As a female who is 50 and played with Barbie I was not excited to see this movie.  I don't love pink and haven't thought about Barbie for many years.  But......this movie was alot of fun.  Saw it with my 15 year old stepdaughter.  I appreciated how it illustrated the harsh reality of being a woman at times.  Growing up I never had a Ken doll because he wasn't important.  It was about what Barbie could do (which was anything a little girl could dream of). The movie hit the nail on the head and was pure fun.,2023-07-24

I wish GIJoe would have been similar.  Good movie.  Lived up to the huge marketing strategy.  If you have a wife, sister, mother, daughter.  Take them to see this movie.",2023-07-24
Anyone else really disappointed with Barbie? I feel like I bought into the hype and went into it open minded. The story was uninteresting and the jokes kept missing their mark imo. I‚Äôm genuinely shocked by how positive the reviews are.,2023-07-25

"Barbie Movie Thought Dump

The Kens need Feminism  
  
There's an obvious feminism discussion going on through the film. A main plot point is Barbie going to the real world and facing the ""patriarchy"", which is name dropped as a major plot force throughout the movie. To understand how it is used though, you have to first look at Barbie land.  
  
Barbie land is a magical place where a plaster pink idea of women supremacy reigns supreeme (note, not feminism, but supremacy). The Kens exist as eye candy with no real purpose and the Barbies go through a laundry list of these ideals, like a balance of emotion and rational thought and reaching and achieving any goal they set their mind to. While played as a joke, if clipped that scene could be used in a dystopian wonderland. Then generic Barbie has intrusive thoughts of death and cellulite and her fantasy is broken.  
  
In the real world, Barbie is forced to acknowledge that her work in Barbie land has not mirrored the real world. Here, women are not in charge and have little to no power; a point shown through her objectification (a man slapping her ass in public) and a Mattel board consisting of only men.   
  
When Barbie returns to Barbie land only to find Ken has brought the Patriarcy back home and brainwashed the other Barbies, she is devastated as she wants to go back to being perfect. Perfect being: flawless hair, no thoughts of death and no celulite, a very superficial definition.  
  
After experiencing the poor treatment women face in the real world and being forced to aknowlage this similar treatment to the Kens in her world, Barbie rembers the Matrix decision of choosing between heels or flats. The way things were, or the way things are. Here, the Kens are a metaphor for feminism: a fight for gender equality.   
  
Ken's journey is meant to mimic the suffrage movement. For women to get the right to vote, they had to rely on men to pass laws to give them rights. There is a level of irony to that statement. And this right didn't fix everything, it was merely a step in the right general direction.   
  
At the end of the movie, the Kens don‚Äôt get a supreme court seat or any position of real power and the marrarator notes, ‚Äúthe Kens have to start somewhere.‚Äù The outrage this situation causes some audience members (as dense as some may be) does put a light on some of the progress equal rights movements have made in gender equality. The Kens should have more positions of power and better representation. In the real world, the same goes for women.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ken is an Incel  
  
In the last year I‚Äôve noticed multiple shows and movies (particularly comedic ones) tackling the topic of incels. More often than not, the incel is shown as a sterotypically attractive male in his mother‚Äôs basement doing nothing but objectifying women and complaining that life isn‚Äôt fair. This portrayal is stupid as it paints a one dimentional boogie man that no one can relate to, so no one will ever see themselves in the character, be willing to critique themselves, or promote meaningful change.   
  
The Barbie movie tackles this topic with a slam dunk by creating a character who is somewhat sympathetic while still being very much in the wrong. Ken is quite literally created to be Barbie's boyfriend. Barbie and Ken. The twist, Generic Barbie isn't interested in Ken. She never has been. Ken has a crisis because his whole purpose is to be Barbie's boyfriend and he can't fulfill this role. The narrator emphasizes this by saying, ""Barbie always has a perfect day. Ken only had a good day when Barbie looked at him.""  
  
There‚Äôs a feminist parrallel here, and a storyline where Barbie goes through a similar journey of self discovery, but it‚Äôs cool to see this topic tackled from the male perspective. In western culture, there‚Äôs a strong emphasis on a man‚Äôs worth being based on his capability to have a partner. Ken is not excluded from this expectation.   
  
Ken is a conventionally attractive, ripped, himbo who is doing everything in his power to get his girlfriend‚Äôs attention and getting little to none of it. He‚Äôs kicked out every night so Barbie can have girls night. He isn‚Äôt included in the big choreo number, only jumping in when a different Ken taunts him for having a part. He‚Äôs upset and defeated, so when he goes to the real world and sees the roles flip, he jumps at the opportunity for power. He wants some control and sense of purpose.   
  
In practice, even with all the power and control, Ken still can‚Äôt force Barbie to like him and doesn‚Äôt get the one thing he thought he wanted. When Barbie tells him to find what makes Ken, Ken, he begins with the very simple statement of, ‚ÄúKen is me‚Äù. Later, he is seen wearing a sweater that syas Kenough.   
  
There‚Äôs not a ton of payoff to this story line, but it‚Äôs not the plot of the movie, merely a consequence of having characters other than Barbie with hopes and ambition. A consequence of good writing. If there ever was a sequel delving into Ken‚Äôs character, there would be a deep well to pull from and I suspect horses would be involved.   
  
The interesting point is that this light incel characterization of Ken is defeated as Ken is forced to find purpose outside of romance. He needs to find joy in himself, by himslef. He needs to be Ken. Not some gender flipped other as ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äôs Boyfriend‚Äù.   
  
  
  
What is ""Barbie""  
  
In the Barbie movie, ‚ÄúBarbie '' is an abstract concept. The beginning of the movie pushes a strong corporate message thart Barbie allows girls to see themselves in any role, so all their problems are solved! Then the movie immediately dismantles this idea because, of course, it‚Äôs fictitious bs.   
  
Throughout the movie, Generic Barbie is forced to experience a more human existence and begins critiquing herself. She doesn't feel beautiful. She's not as smart as the other, more skilled Barbies. She doesn't doesn't know what her purpose is.  
  
This idea is also reflected in Ken. Ken has to learn to be his own person and find purpose outside of having a woman. He‚Äôs not doctor Ken, he‚Äôs not astronaut Ken, he‚Äôs not beach Ken. He is Ken and that is Kenough.  
  
These points are cemented in America Ferra‚Äôs monolouge discussing the complex and contradicting requirements of being a woman. It‚Äôs an excellent monolouge I encourage everyone to read because, at its roots, it discusses the struggles of being human. Never feeling good enough. Never knowing what you‚Äôre meant to do. Constantly comparing yourself to others. The movie is asking you to become the person you want to be. Find your interests and your desires and wear them unapologetically. At the same time, without having to directly say it, it‚Äôs asking you to respect other‚Äôs hopes and dreams so that they can do the same to you.  
  
At the end of the movie - in the limbo, white wall, projector realm - Barbie states that she doesn't want to be an idea - something that was created - but the thing that creates them. Humans. Barbie, as a concept, helps inspire others, but at the end of the day that is all an idea can do. An idea is at the whim of the actions of those who create. It is influenced and changed by them and has no control over itself. An idea itself cannot create. When Barbie choses to become human, she choses to make her own decisions and pave her own path despite the difficulties that come with being in charge of making your own decisions.",2023-07-25
"In the spirit of its ""all about Men"" theme that some reviewers have taken lets a look at some of those aspects in more detail:  
  
**Satire of Male Superiority**: The film gives satirical treatment of Ken's journey from a ""needy beau"" to a ""swaggering, macho doofus."" His transformation is an exaggeration of stereotypes associated with masculinity and serves to critique the idea of male superiority. It should also be seen as a mirror satire of ""female inferiority"" and the sterotypes assocaited with that in the real world.  
  
**Mockery of Corporate Gender Politics**: The depiction of Mattel's headquarters and CEO subtly critiques corporate attempts to appear diverse and progressive while maintaining a patriarchal system. This critique extends the discussion of toxic masculinity into the corporate world, demonstrating how such behaviors can permeate different levels of society. It was telling that the CEO was verbally ""all about female empowerment"" and yet that wasn't followed through with any actual actions despite ""gender neutral restrooms up the wazoo"".  
  
**Subversion of Male Stereotypes**: The character of Allan, who is ""bumbling awkwardly in a sea of hunky Kens,"" serves to subvert the stereotype of the hyper-masculine male, further challenging toxic masculinity. Allan is in many ways the unexpected hero fighting for the mother and daughter. He doesn't have muscles but ""Just Allen"" is enough and Barbie would probably be better off with Allen. Allen is an everyman who doesn't attempt to fit into to the hyper masculine world of ""Beach"" Ken. However his heroic efforts go under appreciated.   
  
**The Struggle for Male Identity**:  Ken's existential struggle is examined, showcasing his dependency on Barbie for identity affirmation. His journey towards self-discovery and self-definition is a key aspect of dismantling toxic masculinity, as it stresses the importance of individuality and emotional authenticity over conformity to traditional masculine roles.  
  
In sumamry the film is kenough of a satire of toxic masculinity that I laughed all the way through it. Its not anti men there are positive male role models too, not least the self discovery of Ken.   
  
Its almost perfect, a masterpeice.",2023-07-26
"This movie was a lot of fun and it told it's story in a unique and thoughtful way. Gave it like a 9/10

I've been looking around at commentary and I'm starting to think it's biggest failing is simply falling victim to the cultural climate we are in (don't worry, keep reading.) Barbie takes a modern perspective and uses it to apply analysis and critique of a magical realism Barbie world. If we take it at that, it really is a superb film. 

But when I look at commentary for the movie I'm consistently seeing two complaints on the opposite ends of a spectrum 1) The film did not do enough to seriously unpack patriarchy and misogyny and critique them in a meaningful and impactful way or 2) The film did too much to unpack patriarchy and misogyny  and critique them in a meaningful (or disingenuous) and impactful way.

I think people have unwittingly gotten caught up in the narrative that this film was gonna change the world and lead to the next wave of new feminist theory. If you just let it be a fun, yet intelligently written, movie there is so much less to be disappointed with.

Just let Barbie be Barbie yall",2023-07-26

"The movie had some good messages, funny jokes, and entertaining sequences. The script should have been given another look at the story level. It felt like there were some conflicts that weren't even introduced until the very end, and character arcs without setup or payoffs.

"This movie is great on all levels. The writing, directing, casting, costumes, acting, etc. all worked for me.

I felt personally seen when the Ken was explaining how CDs work when Barbie said she keeps her money in a savings account. It is a recreation of the all the conversations I have with my wife about financial investments lol.",2023-08-09
"Am I the only one that thought the music was bad?  I liked the idea of most of the songs, the various messages or even when they were just saying what happens, but as *songs* they weren't good.  2 minutes outside of the theater and I couldn't tell you a single lyric from any of the songs that weren't ""Push.""",2023-08-10
"Just saw this with a crowd likely much different than most posting here, a non-US crowd where people in general don't really audibly react to things very much. Also no one wearing pink in sight. Not a bad movie, but without an involved crowd it hit a bit flat overall. I honestly think the Barbenheimer of it all and the cinema viewing experience with fervent crowds is greatly benefiting the movie. Without that, I think it'd be regarded as better than you'd ever expect from a Barbie/toy movie to be, and overall a decent comedy with a plot that's otherwise a bit of mess, but nothing you must rush to the theaters for. 

**Spoilers here forward:**

I also just find the end result of the Kens in Barbieland a little odd given the overall themes and messages of the movie. Maybe I was expecting something too much and just reading into things, but it felt like there were numerous setups for some sort of ""oh, the real world isn't the equality heaven we thought, which has made me think about our own Barbieland and realize that the Kens are a bit of second class citizens, generally just our accessories and we should be supporting them to be more"" type of turn. Like there's the ""oh, I don't know where Ken's live"" line which I thought would be a setup for something, and while it likely is meant to tie into Ken's line of ""I hoped this would be *our* house"" thing later, it kind of was just a throw away line. When the Barbies are gung ho to make Barbieland basically exactly how it was to start with I was waiting for Barbie to have the ""excuse me, actually i think..."" moment. In the end, there's a little bit of it with the whole helping Ken realize that Kens can have an identity exclusive of their Barbies and should be able to be fulfilled without a Barbie, but something just felt a bit missing imo. Like basically the underclass rises up after finding out about an alternative possibility, then is squashed back down to where they were in society with a slight caveat of ""we'll let you start being involved in some minor positions.""

In the end the movie is just ultimately about Barbie coming to realizations about life and helping her Ken realize a life without her and likely delving into such a plot was outside of what Gerwig wanted to focus on...but I feel that plot easily could have been fit in if the Mattel Board of Executives just weren't in the movie, as other than getting Will Ferrel's name for marketing idk what they really added. You even have the teenager to be like ""uh, I'm all for women in power but this society is kinda messed up"". Idk, maybe that'd be too stereotypical of a plot but I think it would have led to more of an actual ending/leaving point for Barbie rather than everything going more or less back to normal and then her just leaving because the world she fought to restore she doesn't really enjoy anymore...",2023-08-17
This movie was good but not great. The pace is unbearable at times which sucks because there are some really funny and engaging moments.

I really love the references and knacks to the real life Barbie dolls, one of my favorite scenes has to be the ""Bad Day"" scene where Stereotypical barbie becomes more and more weird.

I was sitting next to like the stereotypical image of a rough and tough  'Merican country man and he was giggling throughout the whole thing.    


Only beef is that the transition to the gloves off ""alright let's address some things"" part of the movie was just super **BAM!**  I would have preferred a slower transition into it but then the movie would have to be super long.  I guess I'll just have to wait for the Snyder cut.

The guy who played Ken did a great job and worked well the guy who played Ken and the chemistry between them and the guy who played Ken just made a good trio.  I thought the guy who played Ken was a bit stiff but I'll blame the director for giving the guy who played Ken more lines than the guy who played Ken.

My complaint, however, is they are too focused on the whole patriarchy concept in the dialog. I think the best stories/movies show not tell. I think there was more potential in showing how it affects women in some scenes rather than explicitly stating it repeatedly. I think that would have made the message stronger. Obviously, if they mentioned it a couple times that is not a problem, but halfway through the plot that's all they talk about.

If you don't think so, let me know! I don't know anything about making movies or writing them, so take this with a grain of salt! 

Overall, I think it was a fantastic movie!",2023-09-23
"One of the underlying concepts of the storyline in this movie was cool. I found that there were a lot of similarities with the Matrix where Barbie gets essentially unplugged from a perfect world and chooses to live a life in the real world.

I wished that the depiction of the real world in this movie was more realistic. The polarization of the conceptually perfect world and reality would have been better pronounced which I think would've been cool

The scenes where Barbie becomes more human were really wholesome and emotional, I loved that!

As a relatively unextraordinary woman who is neither a president nor a mother, nor a president who is also a mother, I felt seen by Gloria‚Äôs ordinary Barbie idea as well as Barbie‚Äôs struggle to live up to expectations. I loved how Barbie didn‚Äôt feel the need to compare herself to others until she was exposed to the real world. The line about needing to be extraordinary but also not too extraordinary really resonated with me.

On the other hand, as someone who‚Äôs been working on a novel series for years, I related with Ruth Handler as well and absolutely loved the scene with her talking to Barbie. It‚Äôs a little different since they‚Äôre characters in a book, but I feel like if I were to meet my girls IRL somehow, I‚Äôd say something similar to them.

Anyway, great movie. Banger songs, great jokes, great acting all around (special mention to Helen Mirren as the narrator - she was perfect! and of course, Ryan Gosling as Ken) and a really nice conclusion for Barbie‚Äôs arc.",2023-07-22

"I loved this movie so much, and it‚Äôs so interesting how people have their differing perspectives on some of the role reversing that happened in Barbieland. 

A lot of people are teasing the filmmaker about making the Kens ‚Äúunlikable,‚Äù but people still liked the Kens. I don‚Äôt think Greta‚Äôs point at all was to make the Kens un-likeable. The kens are very much naive, and don‚Äôt desire to have power over the women in Barbieland, but just to be paid attention to, and valued to the extent that the Barbies are valued. It‚Äôs the same feeling that women feel in the real world, and the basis of feminism except reversed. 

Sure the Barbies can be mean towards the Kens, but it never even goes so far to the extent that real women are treated like in the real world. They just lack attention/appreciation, and in the end Barbie apologizes for her behavior, and assures Ken that he doesn‚Äôt need hyper-masculinity or the patriarchy to be his own person. She assures him that he can find himself. The song penned by Billie Eilish ‚Äúwhat was I made for‚Äù applies to many characters in Barbie, but especially both to Barbie AND Ken. They‚Äôre uncertain of their place in the world, and who they are. 

Even the Mattel employees aren‚Äôt evil. They all come to an equal understanding, and allow Barbie to live in the real world, and keep Barbieland the way the folks want it to be. 

So I still don‚Äôt understand how people interpreted this movie as ‚Äúman-hating‚Äù or ‚Äúpropaganda.‚Äù",2023-07-25
"I ended up seeing this movie twice.  I think it's fair to say that the messaging is a little confused.

Here's what I mean.  Barbieland is at first portrayed as a total matriarchy.  Barbies rule.  Kens have no personality outside of their relationship to Barbies.

The movie then has Barbie say that women in Barbieland are treated how men are in the real world.

But, the movie also goes out of its way to show us that the real world, while still patriarchal, is more complicated.  Ken can't just go get any job he wants because he's a man.  He has to go to Barbieland to *actually* create that level of patriarchy.

But I find it weird then when the Kens at the end ask for a Supreme Court justice and are told, no, you can't.  Because in the real world, 4/9 justices on the supreme court are women.  It's not a great example to use if you're trying to suggest a parallel between Barbieland and reality.  The presidency would have been a more fitting example.

I definitely get the point as to why the Barbies retain more power in the end.  It's like, the Barbies and Ken have a nice moment where they all realize they should be equal, but then the Barbies still retain most of the power, which is kind of the result of early feminism in the US.

That point makes sense, but I just think it's still hard to pin down exactly what the film is saying about patriarchy in reality.  It seems to simultaneously claim reality is comically patriarchal while also trying to say its a bit more nuanced, and I think that leaves its messages muddled.

I still really like the rest of the movie, I think the production design, performances, jokes, score all work.  But I'm just not sure on its message.",2023-07-25
"It's not nearly as funny as I expected it would be. It's a entertaining cute movie, very good acting for most actors, the production design and costumes are rad and some of the gender commentary is engaging but the movie is too rushed and it's overly preachy and too obvious. I mean, America Ferrara and the daughter just show up and we're supposed to care about them. 

Ryan Gosling is the MVP but I do think Margot Robbie is just as good and I don't think they could have found a better choice for Barbie. She looks like Barbie. 

I don't get why Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera got so much praise. McKinnon is pretty much playing the tired SNL persona and Cera's awkward Allan is a one joke character. I liked Issa Rae, Kingsley Ben Adir, Simu Liu and Nicola Coughlan more.",2023-07-26
[deleted],2023-07-28
"This was pretty damn good. It plays like an independent artsy statement film, which is kind of wild considering it‚Äôs literally produced in part by Mattel. I loved the messages about the effects of patriarchy on men and women and the idea that men can start defining manhood apart from their relationship and impact on women. I don‚Äôt see how anyone could hate that. We all need to be free from these antiquated norms that limit who we can be. One of the speeches about the contradictions of being a woman was taken nearly verbatim from one of my favorite tiktokers. I hope they give her credit. Anyway, Ryan Gosling stole the show. I hope he wins something. And Margot was really amazing in her naunced performance. I‚Äôd give this a 8.5 out of 10.",2023-07-29
[deleted],2023-07-30
"Finally watched it last night‚Ä¶ liked it overall but I felt the second half kind of fell off somewhat. The first half wasn‚Äôt exactly subtle by any means but the social / gender commentary was clever and fun, and I enjoyed the performances. 

In the second half I felt like they started to try to really beat audiences over their head with the messaging and all the relative subtlety was thrown out the window. To be clear I‚Äôm not an incel who hates the message. I just don‚Äôt necessarily love films where the messaging is written explicitly into expository dialogue to the point where it‚Äôs being spoon fed to us like we‚Äôre idiots. The whole monologue that America Ferrara had towards the end about women‚Äôs obstacles in a patriarchal society just felt sooo heavy-handed‚Ä¶ it grounded the film to a total halt and took me out of the narrative. I felt like all the goodwill the first half of the movie had generated start to sour somewhat as a result of these second-half choices, as it just began to feel like, Wow, this film doesn‚Äôt trust us enough to understand what they were getting at early in the film, and now they‚Äôre literally just spelling it out and clobbering us with it. 

Having said that I still enjoyed it overall. Margot Robbie was perfect in the role, and her acting has gotten so strong in the past decade since Wolf of Wall Street. I liked her in that film too but I think she‚Äôs spoken in interviews of hiring dialect coaches etc and you can really trace her refining her craft with some of her recent projects and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she gets an Oscar nom here. There were some emotional moments where I found myself quite moved (such as the scene on the park bench with the older lady) and I think it‚Äôs a testament to her skills as an actress to be able to make us care about a Barbie doll, as the character could have been written so differently and been much more of a one-trick ‚Äúfish out of water‚Äù pony. Having said that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded more of the film taking place in the real world and seeing some more of their antics in modern society. 

Ryan Gosling was hilarious and stole the show in a comedic sense, but I liked that Margot had the dramatic moments to counter the silliness. But that scene at the school where he‚Äôs talking to the mom for example was cracking me up. And when he shows off all his wrist watches later. üòÇ

I‚Äôm sure there will be sequels and spin offs and a Mattel-verse but I‚Äôd probably rather they just leave it alone as a good single shot story. Everything wrapped up nicely, and continuing it and recapturing the zeitgeist magic will probably be tough.",2023-12-17

A few aspects felt a little half baked or like they got edited out (a lot of the Will Farrel/Cubicle Guy/Mattel stuff), but this is a very good movie that I can see appealing to most anyone. It‚Äôs a type of movie that feels geared towards both kids and adults (like most classics - Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, etc) that has often gone away.   


Its not as funny as some movies and it‚Äôs not quite as good of an exploration on feminism / the lives of women as something like Gerwig‚Äôs Little Women, but that‚Äôs kind of what you get when youre balancing both.

"Thought the movie was great. Good comedy and a self aware film I wasn‚Äôt expecting from something with the Barbie name. As a male I thought the America Ferrera was impactful and well put.

Also seeing it with the gf I thought the mansplaining portion was hilarious because I‚Äôve definitely done the whole *Godfather* and trying to explain the stock market and investments to her.

"Shower thought this morning: Ken's arc is a beat-for-beat recreation of Fight Club. He's even wearing Tyler's coat at the climax. The moral is the same, the resolution is the same and Ken's antagonist is, both more and less, literally himself. Brilliant move by Greta Gerwig!",2023-07-25
"No one's gonna read my comment, but oh well!  

I've learned that Gerwig simply does not do subtlety, and that worked pretty well for Barbie's over-the-top world and story. I really liked this movie. The *overt* feminism and the reversal of making Ken sympathetic in the face of a matriarchy equally as unfair as our real-world patriarchy was an interesting spin. And ""I'm Just Ken"" was such a ride! I thought it was great how soft the Kens' masculinity was, holding hands and being emotionally supportive of each other-- So sweet! And Allan representing the real-life men who support equality and don't subscribe to toxic masculinity was a nice touch.

I liked the bittersweet ending with Kens being limited to aspiring to the power that real-world women hold (ouch). But I'd have liked for the main Ken to have had just a bit more of a wrap-up like Barbie got. (Congrats on the genitals, girl!)  

Another minor complaint I had is that Gerwig has a way of rushing and ham-fisting mother-daughter relationships, which was my main issue with Ladybird, too. As authentic as the relationship is meant to feel (especially since Gerwig has stated that Ladybird was inspired by her own experiences), it just lacks nuance. The cliche rift of angsty teen girl vs her mom. Somehow even in Ladybird, it felt too bland, and there was even less meat on those bones in Barbie. I found myself not being drawn into the tension between the mother and daughter in Barbie at all. It was fine as a B plot I guess and tied into the positive feminine representation. Meh. The dolls ironically felt much more real, their struggles and personalities more compelling, and their conclusions more satisfying.  

Mattel being so cartoonish *kinda* worked, but I thought it dampened the contrast between the supposedly harsh ""real"" world and Barbie's plastic dreamland. I guess it's fine if the intended audience is little kids, but I think it would've benefited from the real world holding more weight, kind of like Disney's Enchanted. But I guess that's really not what they were going for here.  

Anyway, Barbie was fun! It made me laugh several times, and it hit some solid emotional beats. I'm definitely gonna watch it again.",2023-07-26

"I know the film wouldn‚Äôt have been made without it, but the Mattel inclusion held this film back. It really lost the story at one point because of it, but Greta did a phenomenal job at making a film that excelled despite this hinderance and we really saw her range here. The scene with Barbie sat on the bench in the park was so beautiful, along with the ending, but we also saw her satirical, comedy chops at show - I loved the depressed Barbie commercial. Obviously Ryan Gosling steals the movie with his perfect comedic timing and his OTT performance. I think the beach-off/dance scene was the stand out. 

I really didn‚Äôt expect to shed a tear watching this. I‚Äôve still got Oppenheimer to watch, but to the people saving Barbie for second are going to get a big surprise if they want to end their night on a happy note. What was essentially a children‚Äôs film held a final message that they won‚Äôt appreciate until long after they‚Äôre too old to be playing with Barbie.",2023-07-21
"That scene where Barbie tells the older lady at the bus stop that she's beautiful and she says ""I know it!"" and Barbie just smiles so big at her had me absolutely sobbing.

Hella weird movie, can't believe it's a summer blockbuster! Love it.",2023-07-21
"This movie came at a vulnerable time for me, so it really emotionally affected me when Barbie broke down because she didn't feel pretty anymore. I've been feeling sorta trapped in my own body and by my own ideas of my appearance and what I *should* look like, so that hit deep. I feel like this was a movie I really needed to see right now.

Besides the sappy shit, Ryan Gosling stole the show completely. It was such a campy good time and everyone clearly had so much fun making it.",2023-07-21
"if i got this correctly, the main messages in the movie was satire about patriarchy, feminism and self discovery. 

kens in barbie world = women in real world right? so what was that ken uprising supposed to mean? a random feminist uprising that the men (the barbies here) squash and give them negligible power? or is if supposed to be real patriarchy bleeding into barbieworld?? someone please explain it to me lol.

overall, i loved it so much, it was entertaining and the kens were definitely more memorable than the barbies. ken finding out about patriarchy in the real world was the best bit in the movie.",2023-07-22
"I liked how it showed patriarchy doesn't just mean any man can walk into a hospital or corporation and immediately get a high-paying, important job. It's a real effect, but it's not THAT stupid.",2023-07-22
"I may have misinterpreted this, but even though this movie could be considered feminist, I actually appreciate the resolution being much more realistic.

The barbies could have restructured into a society with equal representation but they did not.  This retains the true spirit of human nature, once in power, people will often do everything they can to retain it, woman or man.  Also, change is hard.",2023-07-23
It was fine but I don't believe this high reviews at all. There was funny moments but the movie moves at such a rapid pace and doesn't take a breath. The run time needed to be longer. I think Lego still did it best with mixing the toys with the real world. America Ferrera and her daughters story line didnt have any weight besides the fact to exist for Barbie to be there. The major focus is obviously Barbie but it would have been nice for the humans to have a more meaningful plot.,2023-07-23
"I feel bad saying this because I love Greta, Margot, America and basically everyone in this movie and I love what the message behind the movie; but I actually didn‚Äôt love the Barbie movie. I REALLY wanted to, dressed head to toe in pink, watched lots of the marketing material and was generally just really excited. I was prepared to laugh out loud and also ball my eyes out. However, I was disappointed. I felt it was a case of style over substance and overall felt a little disjointed. I felt things were quite forced, I would have loved the theme of mother / daughter relationships to have been explored further and more details on the connection between barbie / America. America‚Äôs monologue was great but felt again quite surface level. 

I don‚Äôt know, I just left feeling a bit disappointed with it. Was I alone in this? Did I completely miss the point?",2023-07-24
"I don't disagree with the message of the movie, but God damn do I feel like this movie has way less to say than it thinks it does. Every idea this movie has about patriarchy, the male gaze, female objectification, toxic masculinity, etc, is presented in the first scene on the beach in LA, yet the movie still spends the next hour constantly repeating the same thing over and over and over. It never adds any new wrinkles, or works its ideas into the story in an interesting way. It just beats you over the head again and again. By the time we got to the mother's monologue, I couldn't help but roll my eyes. It's almost as if the writers got up out of their chair and said ""No, you actually aren't smart enough to understand the themes we've been extremely unsubtle about, so we're literally just gonna tell you what they are you stupid movie watcher""",2023-07-25
"It was mid. \[spoilers\]

I wanted the storyline to be something a bit more exciting while still keeping the morale of the story (for example, Barbie became depressed, or loss a loved one, etc.) The climax was honestly anti-climatic and there was no true turning point in the movie that gave it that ""wow"" factor. Everything was predictable/non-reactive. On top of that, the morale of the story was kind of unclear/distractive. Like, I know it teaches us about equality and the male dominant world, however they also sprinkled in bits of ""barbie destroyed kids images of themselves"" and ""barbie thinks about death"" and ""barbie doesn't feel like she has a purpose"",,, all of which didn't fit the morale of the story and never really got resolved/explained.

The fact that she became a human confused me the most... like okay, she wants to become the creator not the idea, so what? am I dense or does that have nothing to do with the previous conflicts I've mentioned? What does becoming human have to do with equality, or women never feeling like they're enough, or thinking about death???

Ultimately they touched on too many things at once, thus making the morale of the story a little unclear/distractive. They introduced too many morale's that they couldn't fully address/finish. It was not really happy nor deeply depressive... It was a weird middle where they wanted to portray ""deep"" messages but were limited due to the PG nature of the movie... I don't think it worked out.",2023-07-28
"I saw this the other day and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I liked a lot of it, but it felt like every statement the movie tried to make was undermined by something else and it just made it feel confused and like the production pulled it in too many directions

Maybe the most confusing part is what Greta Gerwig‚Äôs actual take on Barbie is. The movie continuously flips from painting her as a legitimate feminist icon and using Will Ferrell‚Äôs character (undoubtedly the worst part of the movie) to say that she‚Äôs just the corporate idea of feminism designed by men. It feels like it tries too hard to appeal to both the people that have genuine affection for Barbie and those that say she took feminism in the wrong direction. Which is an interesting balance, but the movie never felt like it drew a final conclusion about it. 

I‚Äôm also really bothered by the final line in the movie. Why cast a trans actress to play a Barbie in Barbieland if you‚Äôre going to end the movie with a weird throwaway line about how ‚Äúreal‚Äù women visit the gynecologist? I highly doubt that Gerwig meant anything transphobic by the ending, but it really stuck out in a movie where they bring positive attention multiple times to the fact that the Barbieland residents have no genitalia. 

Overall, I think the movie tried to do a bit too much and its tone and ambitions don‚Äôt really match up in any satisfying way. I‚Äôd probably give it a 3/5 overall and I was really hoping to love it given my adoration for Greta‚Äôs previous work. It just feels like too many ideas were thrown in without consideration for how they‚Äôd play off of each other. Not a bad movie by any means, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt pretty disappointed and confused by it.",2023-07-28

"First half was solid but second half really fell off.  The set design and direction were steller and the performances were honestly perfect for the characters. However, the writing is where this movie really falls behind. For one most of the humor in the movie relied on meta jokes, which consisted of some social commentary said in a joking cadence, which is supposed to be tongue and cheek but ends up feeling lazy. The many  monologues in the movie felt preachy and out of place which is disappointing considering greta gerwig's past scripts. Much of the dialogue fell prone to issues were characters would start giving mini lectures on the themes of the movie, feeling like more like a school play  than a multimillion dollar movie made by oscar nominated writers. The themes of feminism expressed in the movie also felt superficial and infantile with many moments sharing conflicting messages that run contrary to classic feminist thought. The movie was also around 15 minutes too long with the end dragging for quite a while. Overall I felt this  movie had a lot of potential with great background elements but underperformed with the story.

"Gf and I just got home and we loved it. Her experience with it was very personal and was crying during the Billie ellish ending sequence.

I loved the meta feminist aspect to the film but one thing I also appreciate is the film did go out of it's way to make sure there were no real villians, especially the Ken's. All Ken wanted was to be seen and respected as an equal (like women do in the real world) and not be treated as just a boyfriend or afterthought. He had emotions he was trying to repress and grew frustrated at his situation, then when he saw how men acted in our world he only saw how they were treated with respect and decided ""this how ill be seen and make everyone respect me"" and it led to a completely misogynistic ""ken"" world where really they just wanted to feel in control imof their lives. Because Ken and the other Kens weren't ever treated as equals they fought back. Obviously they were in the wrong, but Ken admits he knew that, he just didn't know what else to do and felt no one wanted to listen to him.

Eventually Ken learns the same lesson Barbie does in that we can be beyond our expectations and be whoever we want and to not be afraid of our emotions, and Barbie helps him cone to this conclusion while also apologizing for treating him poorly. 

Ken wasn't evil, he was misunderstood and just wanted to feel seen, just like Barbie did, but because we live in a society where men are told to be ""strong and silent, repress your feelings and emotions"" we have the equation for toxic masculinity. 

This can be applied to Andrew Tate followers, red-pillers, Trumper, etc. It's a clear demonstration of how toxic masculinity is even created and how these monsters of people take advantage of lost and emotionally confused men. 

You could write an entire thesis paper on the themes this film covers.",2023-08-02
"I just watched this movie and I don't get the hype. In an effort to center the mother/daughter characters Barbie became an old-school disney princess and didn't do much outside of cry and run.

Barbie didn't even get her own song, but Ken did. 

Then the movie ends with her apologizing to Ken? For what? Not being interested in him? I might be misremembering but she was never directly mean to him except for when he kept pushing for a romantic relationship. 

Also the idea that Ruth Handler is a feminist icon is kind of laughable. She was a capitalist who saw an adult novelty toy for men (Bild Lilli) and said to herself ""I bet little girls want to play with this."" When her ghost or whatever talks to Barbie my eyes almost rolled out of my head. 

This isn't feminism, it's Mattel Girlpower and the praise and accolades coming in for this one are really baffling me.",2023-09-05

"I get what this movie was doing.I get the agenda.  But my god, this movie was boring as hell. I love the set pieces. The set and costume designs. I love that all the Barbie's are based on real Barbies(That growing up Skipper tripped me out). When Barbie wore the gold jumpsuit at the party, it reminded me of the [Barbie I had in 1981](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/barbie-golden-dream-1981--446137906809368634/)  I loved America Ferrera's speech about women and the ridiculous standards and expectations placed on us. I liked Barbie speaking to the ""creator"" Other than that I expected it to be funnier, whittier and  more clever and was gravely disappointed.",2023-11-18
"This movie was quite odd, all in all. I really liked the humor (the prologue already had me laughing out loud) and the performances (the dance numbers were very good).

In terms of the movie‚Äôs message, I think it‚Äôs a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the movie points out the fact that barbie in many ways commercializes unrealistic standards of beauty and accomplishments, and it criticizes commercialization of mental health. On the other hand, the movie is itself obviously an ad, pointing out all the different barbie products through the ages and giving random bits of trivia about the company (like the fact that barbie was named after the inventor‚Äôs daughter. That sounded like it could have come straight from a barbie website).

On the one hand, the central conflict somewhat acknowledges the struggles of incel-y men and urges Ken to find his own path. On the other hand it sends really wonky messaging regarding how the men were treated (e.g. no one ever tried to de-indoctrinate the men of Ken-dom; the only reason why the vote worked was due to tricking the men into not voting).

I think this is a bit of a missed opportunity, because I liked the way it portrayed women's struggles and it would be possible to write a movie that shows why the patriarchy is bad for both men and women. For women it‚Äôs obvious; for men the problems lie in extremely high pressure to be sexually successful, to support a family on their own, no tolerance for their emotions and no mercy for those men not adhering to the ideal. But instead, the movie doesn‚Äôt really make a convincing argument why the Kens should also oppose patriarchy (which I as a man certainly think they should).

I guess a fantasy dream land is kind of a weird place to make political commentary on anyway, since there is no scarcity of resources, no actual consequences from authoritarian leadership (such as cut abortion rights), no domestic violence or anything like that. The idea of restoring the women to their autonomy by de-programming them was kind of laughable anyway, since they didn‚Äôt have any autonomy in the first place, they were literally caricature dolls that partied all day and never worried about anything profound. So the movie didn‚Äôt really make me feel like the conflict mattered or made sense.

It was a fun watch, but I‚Äôll probably forget about it soon.",2023-07-21
"Absolutely love how the film showed not only how patriarchy is bad for women, but also for men. Ken doesn‚Äôt really want to put women down and act the way he does. But he just feels he should do it because he sees others doing it and he‚Äôs empty on the inside. This is a great movie not just for little  girls, but also for young boys and even grown men.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are great in this. My fellow USC alum, Will Ferrell is funny as always, and the comedy just clicked. A great watch.

[Review](https://boxd.it/4y6pRf)",2023-07-22
"So my bias is that I‚Äôm an adult woman who loved Barbie as a kid, had a feminist mother who didn‚Äôt want me to love Barbie as a kid, went through the ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù internalized misogyny phase as a tween, and circled back to embracing my femininity including an interest in Barbie and knowing quite a bit about Barbie lore as an adult. 


This movie was so great. 


I saw it in a local theatre that had a costume contest beforehand, it was such a happy sight to see almost an entire theatre, men and women, smiling and wearing pink. Immaculate vibes. 


Perhaps, given that, it dilutes a bit of the laughter relative to a more general audience in a more conventional venue, but the comedy genuinely seemed to land throughout and I personally laughed a lot as well. As someone who knew about gaffes such as Pregnant Midge and Earring Magic Ken going in, I probably got more out of some of the jokes than the uninitiated, but I also don‚Äôt think it was so esoteric as to be inaccessible. 


I think this movie works because Greta Gerwig clearly loves Barbie and has also grappled with the problems Barbie represents. The introduction to Barbieland was very true to the way my friends and I played with Barbie dolls as kids and I felt that same recognition from other women in the audience. The tween character‚Äôs takedown of Barbie was very true to the anger I felt at that age; starting to be sexualized because my body was developing while simultaneously being bullied for my acne, resenting movie stars and fictional representations of women such as Barbie who were perfect-looking and who I perceived not having to struggle with self-image. 


It‚Äôs funny to me how the crux of most of the criticism I‚Äôve seen so far centers on America Ferrera‚Äôs monologue about the lose-lose situations women are expected to contend with, because it so mirrors the discourse. Some critics are saying it‚Äôs too on-the-nose with its feminism, while others are saying it didn‚Äôt do enough. Some are saying the treatment of Ken is misandrist, some are saying it didn‚Äôt go far enough and it needed to provide real-world solutions to empower women more. To me, Ken was quite a likable character and it made sense to me that when he saw how much better he was treated in the real world he would want to hold onto that, because that‚Äôs kind of how I felt watching Barbieland in the beginning. I would love to know what it‚Äôs like to have a female president and all-female Supreme Court. I would love to move through the world without being sexualized. I felt that Barbie did realize her privilege in Barbieland and I liked the compromise she made with Ken, but I can see from some of the reviews that didn‚Äôt work for everybody. 


Lastly, people are already predicting that the success of Barbie is going to lead to a lot of lesser-quality toy-centric movies and that probably will prove true. In that vein, I find myself comparing Barbie to The Lego Movie because I think these are the two that work, and they represent the standard any others should be judged by. Both were made by people who had a lot of passion about them and a strong vision for them. The meta elements each one used to represent how children played with each toy were tailored to the subject of their respective movies and I liked that the plots were not interchangeable in this regard. Of course people of all ages enjoy Legos but I think the age of the child in The Lego Movie was chosen well, you get the sense his imagination has not been hindered by adolescence yet but he was mature enough to communicate with his father about wanting a closer bond. Likewise, I noticed Barbie really didn‚Äôt include any very little girls apart from the 2001 gag, and they chose to focus on a tween who had already outgrown Barbie dolls and her mother who missed playing with them together. In my opinion, this was smart not only because it‚Äôs a PG-13 movie and not really targeted at children, but also because the way women are socialized I think a lot of us do go through distinct phases of enthusiastically adhering to stereotypical femininity in childhood, rejecting femininity in adolescence, and finding balance in adulthood that can only be achieved with the benefit of hindsight and the effort of self-reflection.",2023-07-22
"This was a very fun movie and I really enjoyed it. However, it didn't really leave an emotional impact for me. I felt like They were attempting to do way too much in terms of social commentary that it got in the way of the storyline. There were plot points that I feel like were either underdeveloped or just dropped entirely. 

For example, the relationship between mother daughter felt underdeveloped. Why is there conflict between them? what was the mother going through that it lead to her drawing Barbie with thoughts of death? I don't really understand their motivations as characters because we barely spend time with them. We get a little flashback through Barbie and that's it. So when the climax came and she was making a big speech it didn't feel earned because I barely knew anything about her (I don't even remember her name). It also did not make any sense that her speech was what cured the brainwashing because the Barbie's wouldn't really relate to what she's saying because they haven't experienced the real world (at the beginning Barbie did not even understand the concept of catcalling).

The mattel storyline led nowhere as well. There was literally no reason for them to go to Barbieland. It felt like they wanted to do social commentary on capitalism but also weren't able to fully commit to making mattel the villain, so why include it in the first place? What was this super bad thing that was going to happen if Barbie stayed in the real word which led to the chase scene. They also mentioned it happening before (with skipper) that led to bad consequences but never mentioned it again. However, in the end it was suddenly totally fine for Barbie to be in the real world? Maybe because she was a human now, but it was still kind of confusing. 

I also felt like her decision to be human at the end wasn't set-up properly. When she was in Barbieland she never showed discontentment about her life. In fact, when weird Barbie was making her choose (matrix style), she'd rather not know. This would've been fine if she experienced something that warrants her changing her perspective but there was literally nothing good that happened to her in the real world. There was no motivation for her to be human. Although, the idea was that barbie (and by extension the viewers) can be whatever they want is good, I think it could've been better if there was motivation behind her decision.

I also felt bad for the kens as they were essentially at the same place they started.

I know that not every movie should be analyzed scene by scene and you should just enjoy the movie for what it is. These are just some of my thoughts. I still enjoyed the movie overall.",2023-07-22
"Going against the grain here, I actually loved barbie! I feel like it appealed to women and girls of all ages which I loved. As far as people complaining about how ‚Äúbasic‚Äù some of the feminist themes were, it‚Äôs a movie about a toy, it doesn‚Äôt exactly have a target audience of feminist scholars. I think it was witty, original, and really captured the overall essence of womanhood pretty well. Margot Robbie was perfect as Barbie, and Kate McKinnon was great as ‚Äúweird Barbie‚Äù too.",2023-07-23
I am a 34 year old dude and I loved the movie. It's razor sharp and takes no prisioners. Amazing movie by Gerwig.,2023-07-24
"I would just like to say that I think people calling the film anti-man are completely wrong and genuinely fail to understand the basic content of this movie. 

Kens are not human men. the only human men portrayed in this movie other than the dad, who is adorable but not part of the plot, are a satire of the REALITY of the inequality, misogyny, and discrimination in the corporations that profit off women. 

here's a question for anyone who thinks the film is promoting misandry: do you even believe that women face discrimination in the real world? that we have it harder than men? 

do you know or believe anything about the reality of being a woman under patriarchy? 

are you even able to imagine not being treated like a man?",2023-07-26
"I‚Äôm getting annoyed at everyone asking why the Barbie movie has ‚Äúso much hype.‚Äù

Since the beginning of big box-office mega movies, the vast majority of these movies have been targeted towards men, especially those based off of IP. I‚Äôm thinking Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, LOTR, Transformers, etc. Now comes a huge movie that is about women, focuses specifically on female nostalgia, is directed by a female, is aesthetically eye catching and unabashedly feminine, besides looking fun, funny, and well done (which other people have noted in comments). The appeal and ‚Äúhype‚Äù apparently seems to shock and baffle many people on and off this platform. Women make up more than half of the population. I think we‚Äôre seeing the result of a mega movie made specifically for women and by women, who have been vastly underserved in the big budget movie industry.",2023-07-27
"Just saw it today and it was... okay. Honestly more of a wasted opportunity than anything else. I just felt like the movie, like Stereotypical Barbie herself, didn't really know what it wanted to say. The feminist message wasn't anything new, though I did enjoy America Ferriera's monologue. I liked Ryan Gosling as Ken so much more than I thought I was going to. Simu Liu was also pretty delightful. At the same time, I felt like the movie was missing a very big chunk surrounding what exactly happened when Ken came back to Barbieland and the Ken narrative in general. Honestly, we've all seen feminist critiques or reclamations of Barbie, the doll and the concept. It was revolutionary to me when I was a teen girl in the 00's. Not so much anymore in the age of 4th-Wave feminism.

What the movie had a great chance to do, and didn't, is to show that the core of feminism is about equality and equity for both men and women and that trying to have a society where any one group of people hold all the power is morally wrong no matter who is in that group. The movie made the mistake that most people that try to portray a matriarchy did, in that it just swapped the labels, but kept the contents the same and, in doing so, tip-toed right over the point. Ryan Gosling's Ken was compelling to me because he was such a good opportunity to show how men can become alienated and isolated from a society that assigns them to gender roles that are just as restrictive as those for women. Will Ferrel's character would have been such a perfect way to showcase how powerful men enforce negative patriarchal ideals on other men around them while paying lip service to feminism, and how easily a disillusioned and isolated man can miss the nuance and just blame women for his feelings of inadequacy. It would also have been nice to see how Ken was able to influence the other men and how some of the Barbies might have fallen for it, because that absolutely happens in real life. 

The pieces were all there, but the point still ended up somehow just being that it's okay to not know what you want and to not want to date a guy because everyone around you thinks it's what you're supposed to want. Which, once again, is something that would have been a revolutionary concept in the 00's and is now a pretty banal and basic conclusion. I feel like there was absolutely a good movie in there, but all the actual salient points got left on the cutting room floor in favor of making a toothless cash grab for a corporation that knows you want to hear it critique consumerism, but also doesn't want you to actually come away with the thought that you shouldn't buy their dolls.

Also, just as an aside, I actually hated the narration. I liked the self-aware songs a lot, but the narration was just not good and, actually, kinda pissed me off. The scene when Barbie is crying because she's just been exposed to self-consciousness for the first time and the narrator just chimes in to mock the actress for being too pretty to have self-image issues was just gross to me. Is that really the point you want to make with your feminist movie? That only ugly women are allowed to experience self doubt and beautiful women need to just shut the fuck up and be glad they're pretty? Really?",2023-08-09
"I saw it today after seeings snippets and social hype since the release. It was just okay. I thought I was gonna be wowed by the way people talked about it. The first half was great but I felt the message was a little too chaotic and trying really hard to be deep. 

I actually listened and watched billi Elishes music video and song prior to the movie. Her work was actually way better than the movie I have to say. Her 3 min video was so powerful and made me cry. I got it almost instantly. Barbie on the other hand was really into using the stereotypical feminist jargon and said patriarchy way too much. I‚Äôm a feminist but I just didn‚Äôt really think half the movie was needed to drive home the point.

To me, the Ken scenes were boring. I didn‚Äôt care for the music it was like suddenly a musical? The Mattel ceo scenes were funny the first time but their repeated interactions weren‚Äôt needed. 

What I felt was missing was the connection to the mother daughter duo. Understanding their issues and their struggles. Greenblatt is a beautiful young actress but her cast as the teen daughter was not my favorite choice. I wish they had chosen a teen girl that is a bit more‚Ä¶average looking to drive home some of the themes on vanity and coming of age. She looks like a Hollywood actress‚Ä¶not an avg 14 year old. It pulled me from the story tbh especially when she made the speech to Barbie about insecurity. 

I was anticipating the ending having seen the trailer and the social media clips however it wasn‚Äôt as fleshed out as I thought. It seems they pulled a storyline directly from Lois Lowrys ‚Äúthe giver‚Äù added feminism and called it a day, yet there was a depth of the story that was Insinuated but missing from Barbie. The take my hands bit wasn‚Äôt as powerful as I thought and I‚Äôm a sucker for sappy scenes. I didn‚Äôt cry like everyone predicted I would. I honestly still don‚Äôt understand what all these women are referring to when they say the movie healed them? 

I think it was fun and the costume and set designer should win the awards here. Margot Robbie was also a fabulous Barbie. But the story fell flat. Had been just a fun Barbie story without the depth I think it would been okay too but I felt they were trying  to make a point for too many topics that it was a bit chaotic. 

Not terrible but I still think Billie Ellishs take on Barbie was way better. Just my opinion though I‚Äôd probably watch again.",2023-08-09
"The movie felt like it was trying to be everything at once. A social commentary, a feel good film, a parody of itself. It just didn‚Äôt work and so many scenes felt out of place.

Like the daughter suddenly went from hating barbie to yeah I‚Äôll go on an adventure with you, in the space of two scenes. And at the end we‚Äôre supposed to believe the mom and the daughter are best friends again? We saw one scene where she dismissed her mom by getting out of the car, that was it. 

I saw a spoiler about Alan attacking people, didn‚Äôt know the context, but from then on assumed he was some sort of twist villain. Instead he wants to leave and then suddenly is fine with it all? Ok 

Will Ferrel‚Äôs character was well played but added nothing to the plot, you could remove all the CEOs/FBI subplot and the movie stays exactly the same

I really don‚Äôt get what the message was meant to be",2023-08-12
"I watched this movie last night with my gf. I think the it started off pretty well. It was funny. I really enjoyed the part where they come into the real world and notice the difference. Especially Ryan discovering patriarchy was so funny.

But I felt the movie got much worse after that. I was hoping that they would be more clever about showing the struggles of women but they just went with the plain old speech. Nothing new there, everyone is familiar with that idea. The last bit of barbie turning into a human and Ruth telling her about it was just ... garbage? Why?

And every scene with the Mattel execs was just cringe. The parts where Ken couldn't help but assist/explain barbie about photoshop and finance was hilarious. Some of the scenes felt a bit too stretched out and I couldn't connect with the scene where the Ken's realize they are ""kenough"". It was not well made/written/directed imo.

I feel it would have been a lot more interesting if they showed more stuff of Barbie in the real world. Anyways, I do think a lot of other people in the theater were liking the movie. It just wasn't my kind of humor and probably not my kind of movie.

My gf was super excited about watching this movie and she slept off in the middle of it \*facepalm\*",2023-07-21
"I wrote this as a comment to someone regarding the contradiction in the message of this movie and was told to post it separately. Doing so with some edits so it makes sense.


In the real world, what Ken experiences is being respected for simply being who he is, which is what the Barbies experience in Barbieland all the time. Barbies in Barbieland are respected and better simply because they are Barbies (ie men in the real world). However, Ken getting treated better automatically for being a man is wrong, but it is somehow not wrong that Barbies are automatically treated better in Barbieland for being a Barbie. That's one contradiction among many this movie creates. The movie starts with the Kens in Barbieland being an allegory for women in the real world. They are struggling to find a place, respect, and autonomy in a world run by the other gender. Yes, Ken, is given respect in the real world for who he is as a man, just as Barbies, even stereotypical Barbie who has no skills is automatically given respect in Barbie world. Ken is just now experiencing what Barbies have experienced their whole lives: respect and validation. He feels better for how he is treated in the real world, that's because the Barbies have made him feel less than his whole life. But Barbie good, Ken bad. Barbie's quest is presented as one of a fight for equality and self exploration, but the Kens' fight for equality makes them the antagonists. All of this would make sense, if in the end vote, Barbie who has experienced inequality said, hey wait, things shouldn't go back to exactly how they were, because our world is one sided - just the reverse side of the same coin, and the Kens deserve a place and respect. Then the Barbies and Kens collectively moved towards eauality. However, in the end of the movie, the Kens are put back in their place with just slightly more allowences than they had before. How is that possibly a justified ending? How does that not contradict the message of the unfairness and inequality? The movie's conclusion is more focused on revenge rather than understanding and equality. The Barbies don't want equality, they want their own land to remain their own and the men to just occupy it but that's, for some reason, fine and applauded, but somehow the same thing in the real world with reversed genders is wrong. Remember the guy Ken runs into who says we still run things but just hide it better now, and we as an audience are supposed to be disgusted, but that's literally what the Barbie's do at the end: Tell the Kens to just be Ken but then hold all the power. They give a cabinet position to Weird Barbie as a ""sorry, we bullied you"" but the Kens are denied their request for one Ken on the supreme court. The Barbies needed to be above that, but they simply practice the same power hungry, shallow vindictive nature we are meant to hate in the real world. If the point is that women are still treated unfairly in our world so Kens will be treated unfairly in Barbieland, and things just practically go back to how they were, what is the point of this movie? What is the message? Barbies can unfair too? To show inequality sucks? This is not the first movie to do that. The audience for this movie already agrees that inequality is bad, yet somehow they left the movie being okay with inequality in Barbieland towards Kens. It would be fine if the movie was clever and highlighting its audience's own hypocrisy and vengeful nature, but it's not, people are leaving the movie thinking the Barbies are good and that everything was wrapped up nicely and all is good in Barbieland which is astounding.",2023-07-22

I think what it had to say is valid.

But‚Ä¶ somehow a lot of it felt cringe to me. Too on the nose speeches. I was mostly expecting FUN camp from the marketing, and we got a lot of Hallmark-esque emotional elements that felt like a buzzkill. It‚Äôs probably good that some people seeing it are asking questions about patriarchy if they weren‚Äôt aware already. But it wasn‚Äôt for me or the other women I saw it with. I‚Äôm bummed!

"Watched it today, and I enjoyed it. The message about women empowerment and just pretty much how us men are was accurate. A scene i that got me thinking was when Gloria was talking about the role women play in life, especially in men‚Äôs life. How they pretty much have to be perfect, they have to be mothers but not show off their kids too much, being leaders but not being too hard/bossy. Yeah this applies to men too, but the expectation on guys isn‚Äôt that high. Men and women both experience different struggles, this movie covered a majority of women‚Äôs struggles, men are expected to shoulder all burdens and not complain or talk about our feelings. I‚Äôm not political whatsoever, but this movie reminded me of how much I appreciate women, and what they go through and what us men put them through.",2023-07-23
"I wish the movie utilized metaphors and showing us concepts as opposed to just saying it. The mothers speech, while true, just didn‚Äôt have an impact on me cause it was just too literal and direct, kind of stale. Other than that, funny movie

While I enjoyed the film I feel that overall the writing was a letdown for me. The third act was the weakest one and unfortunately it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs most important to the message. It felt incredibly heavy handed at times especially with the Am√©rica Ferrera scene. With it being so heavy handed and on the nose about the patriarchy I can‚Äôt help but think about the actual reality they put a spotlight on but don‚Äôt seem to really have an answer for. At the end of the day the CEO of Mattel and WB are still men and they‚Äôre the ones profiting off this and will continue to sell their products and continue adding to the issue.,2023-07-21

Sublime!,2023-07-21
"I'm curious what everyone thinks of the ending where Barbie realizes she's no longer perfect, and that she's also not the ""smart"" Barbie or the leadership oriented Barbie. She realizes she is not ""extraordinary"" in any way. Did you feel like they got a resolution or a message across? Or was the message that to be a woman is impossible because you can't do anything right, and you can't possibly wear all these different hats. Being a mom, and president; or being a bikini model, and supreme court justice. They just kind of threw in America Ferrera's suggestion that I think rang true for most women, what about being average? What about a Barbie who's not extraordinary in any way? No matter who you are or what you do -- majority of life is carrying out mundane rituals of bodily maintenance (showering, eating, going to the doctor.) Hence why those are the first things to go when Barbie Land crumbles and also the last jab of a joke. 

I think America Ferrera's speal about it being impossible to be a woman hit the nail on the head but I think the montage of home videos sort of made me lose the message. Children are pure potential? Barbie is pure potential? 

In the emotional scene with Ruth where Barbie asks to be human and Ruth explains she never needed permission she has full autonomy to be who she wants to be and Barbie grapples with how confusing it is to know what you want. It's hard to have autonomy and make your own decision, hence why the Barbie's so easily go from being a neurosurgeon to serving the Ken's food and loving being an accessory to the Ken's. Because making your own decisions, having your own money, career, ambitions, property is HARD. And quite frankly us humans are perhaps not meant to do it alone. It would've been interesting to see them explore relationship dynamics and attachment within the patriarchy and feminist world that was clashing. Like this narrative that women need to be girl bosses and prove they can do it all -- like live alone or support a family when in reality I don't think humans were meant to be alone, we were meant to pair bond. Maybe that's why they emphasized the Mother and daughter dynamic so much. Made me think of how much I hated my mom when I was a tween and now I think the world of her and remind her all the time how obsessed I am with her. I think these were all universal human experiences especially for women. There is no real thoughts here just spitballing stream of consciousness but would love to hear others thoughts.

"Greta Gerwig‚Äôs world built like a mofo in the beginning and did a great job there. I don‚Äôt disagree with her message about the patriarchy. I was surprised that this was less of a comedy and more of a dramedy, so my expectations maybe weren‚Äôt set at an accurate point. In all, I don‚Äôt feel like the story was coherent after the conflict point (after the Kens all fight). The last act felt rushed to get to an ending. It was a higher thinking movie than I originally anticipated, but we asked for originality from Hollywood and Gerwig delivered an original Barbie story, so kudos to that. It definitely broke up the MCU‚Äôs storytelling formula and Barbie is probably that palate cleanser accesible to everyone.",2023-07-22
"Gosling stealing the show feels almost antithetical to the premise, but the clincher for me is the ending. Why would Barbie decide to live in the real world after seeing the reality of the patriarchy? Wanting to create rather than be the product kinda subverts the plot.

"Just saw it. It was about what I expected, and I enjoyed it. Barbieland was quite the set piece, and the integration of various Barbie products felt seamless and natural. I especially liked the film's score, especially while they were in Barbieland and how the music sort of responded to whatever was happening, even in the lyrics. The costume design felt very on-brand. I adored the characters' over-the-top personalities and acting, especially on the Kens. The lead Ken was a pleasure to watch. Stereotypical Barbie was likewise the right amount of melodrama and radiance for the character, though appropriately geared more towards drama than some of the wackier elements of the film. 

My only sticking point was Mattel's depiction and its board of directors. I suppose no director or writer could get away with making them look explicitly *bad* per se, (can you get away with making a movie about an existing IP while simultaneously villainizing their parent company? I'm skeptical.) so the CEO ultimately had to at least present himself as redeemable, and Will Ferrell was very par for the course in this role.",2023-09-24

Message: 

IDK what the movie was trying to tell me. I mean the entire Barbie Land was first ruled by women only and then suddenly the men took over and then men took over so they started calling it patriarchy. Entertainment? the set was the only thing that was a little entertaining but that is it. I understand that they were trying to portray that barbies are SUPPOSED  to be perfect but that is not how it should be in real world. the movie would have been actually good and time worthy if they would have stuck to this point only rather than adding unnecessary feminism into it!!",2024-03-07

On further reflection, I'd say the movie really reminded me of USS callister, that one really excellently written and good episode of Black mirror that was also fundamentally carrying a pretty nasty message about how you shouldn't feel like you have to be nice to socially awkward. Weird nerds.

This gave me the same kinds of vibes as that, but it was done even more skillfully such that even though there's a lot of humiliating men for the sake of it and I feel like I should be annoyed about that. I still kind of laughed along with it. So Kudos to Greta Gerwig.

Part of it is that there was just enough nuance and kindness, even if it was a very very partial and grudgingly given like can getting a chance to make something of himself even if he's still clearly an idiot and doesn't actually achieve anything by the end of the movie.

So I did indeed see Barbie and Oppenheimer together and I'm just saying that
there's a scene in oppenheimer where he's pouring his heart out about his guilt to Emily blunt and she's pretending to be sympathetic and then loses patience with him, that would literally fit in that scene in Barbie movie where the kens are pouring out their hearts to the Barbies. Physicist ken. Also he literally had Jean Tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend. He loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things, people call him a dilletante, womanizer and insecure, neurotic. There's even an early scene in the movie where he's pursuing Jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off. Just saying the dude would have fit right in Kendom",2023-07-23
"I really enjoyed the movie and found it absolutely hilarious - it was gratifying to see a world where roles were reversed (an escapist fantasy) and have that world be contrasted with the real world that is accurately depicted as one that can be uncomfortable and terrifying for women. I must add that I went into the movie without expecting a Barbie movie to teach me about feminism. If anything, it tackles the subject matter with breadth (matriarchy, patriarchy, toxic masculinity, empowerment) but not as much depth. And you know what? That's perfectly fine. The film was a visual treat, the actors really leaned into their campy roles (Margot was the Barbie we never knew we needed, America was so earnest, and Ryan was hilarious), and it was good fun overall.

If I were to be critical, I would pick on the characterisation and development of Gloria (though America did a FANTASTIC job).  Our introduction to Gloria >!is through these irrepressible thoughts of death that 'infect' Barbie!<. Yet, we never get a proper exploration of Gloria's>! mental state !<nor do we see how >!being in Barbieland helped Gloria psychologically!< (since the movie ends with Barbie's ending, not Gloria's). Had this been done, the monologue would have been even more impactful. After all, Gloria is the heart of the film as the key human character. I'm also not 100% sure why Gloria's >!drawing of Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie (a new creation per se) impacted Stereotypical Barbie in the first place. Is it because Gloria, as a Mattel employee, was basing a new creation off an old model and causing changes to SB? In addition, are we meant to assume that Margot's SB only has a link to a single human being, i.e. Gloria? Given mass production, wouldn't it mean that Stereotypical Barbie is being played with by thousands of kids? Or is it that every version of SB has 1 human connection, and we're just looking at Margot's version of SB? Of course these weren't pressing questions but they did occur to me upon reflection!!<

That being said, I still absolutely loved it and would watch the film again in the cinemas if asked. I can imagine Barbie joining the ranks of Princess Diaries, Mean Girls and The Devil Wears Prada as pop culture favourites for time to come.",2023-07-24

I really have not seen all these woke and anti men messages. All the time they spoke about patriarchy it was to make a joke and I don't need Barbie to know that this is a men's world. Sure there is an underlying message but for me it was about accepting ourselves even if we are not perfect. Some people just want to be mad at everything.",2023-07-25
"MOVIE COMBO : BARTRIX (BARBIE x MATRIX) 

Many people got into the hype of Oppenheimer and Barbie, but I have another combo to offer. 
I highly recommend watching Barbie and then rewatching the 1999 Matrix. 
To celebrate Warner's 100 years anniversary, they had special showing of famous and critically claimed movie, and the week I went to watched Barbie, Matrix was showing. I regret nothing ! Watching Matrix in theatre right after Barbie was amazing! Both of those movies comment on our reality. 

One does it with an absurd, chaotic, and colourful atmosphere, while the other is an absurd, chaotic, and dark action movie. 

Aside from the iconic pills moment, both share many other aspects, like using the same scheme of parallel world. Even though inside the Matrix, the world is not perfect like Barbieland, the world outside the Matrix is so much worse. 

Some argue that the Weird Barbie is like Morpheus. Indeed, both of them were touched by the real world, and both revealed to the protagonist that their idea of their world is far from the truth. 

Also, let's go back to the pills' choice for a moment. In Matrix, Neo does not seem to hesitate to take the red pill, whereas Barbie doesn't want to know the harsh reality. She wants to go back to her bliss ignorance. And that, right there is so interesting and reveals a hard fact about humans. Although many of us like to believe that we would gladly take the truth, in reality, many would rather stay in their ignorance and deny the hard reality. Especially if said truth will negatively impact their comfort. And I'm seeing it with the hate from men towards feminism. 

Not convinced yet? MATTEL executives are like the Smiths. They even run a but like them! They do it in a more absurd and comical way, but they kinda do. The way their arms swings while their body stay still !",2023-07-27
"I thought the movie did the big things really well. The juxtaposition between barbieland and the real world was on point and really got the message of the movie across: ‚ÄúHey what if women ruled everything and men were seen as just objects ? Well flip the roles and you have the real world‚Äù 

I think towards the end the movie they started to spoon feed this to the audience a little too much (I‚Äôm just not a fan of monologues). And I don‚Äôt know why the barbie creator was in there, she didn‚Äôt say anything that the movie wasn‚Äôt already saying.

Robbie and Gosling were great, I can‚Äôt imagine anybody else who are more ‚ÄúBarbie and Ken.‚Äù The funny moments in movie pretty much all landed, especially the scenes with the Kens. 

Overall a really entertaining movie",2023-07-28
"This was one of the more spectacle heavy movies I‚Äôve seen from Hollywood in a long time, and I enjoyed it for that! The sets were great and the choreography was fun.

However, it seemed like there were some issues behind the scenes when it came to what story this production wanted to tell. I strongly suspect there were a lot of ideas and perspectives about the themes of feminism, female agency, adolescence, matriarchy vs patriarchy, etc. that were suggested by writers/producers/directors ‚Äî some of which weren‚Äôt compatible with one another or even contradicted each other ‚Äî but were nonetheless all incorporated into the film in some way. The message was a mess and the overall story and character continuity suffered for it.",2023-08-07

"I'm not really understanding the high praise I'm seeing so far. 

This movie felt like it was all over the place in terms of the tone and the story it wanted to tell and many of the jokes were flat in delivery. It went on some weird existential romp that felt unearned and there weren't really any emotional payoffs. The subplots with Will Ferrell and America Ferrera felt very shoehorned in with no real point, the daughter was annoying the entire film, and honestly Gosling seemed to be the only consistent bright spot as Robbie put in a pretty bland performance overall. And that monologue? It felt like a bad SNL sketch that kept going on and on before commercial break. Super weird and didn't feel genuine or earned at all. 

This is nowhere near either Lady Bird or Little Women in terms of quality for me and I'm rather disappointed after looking forward to this for a while now. Terrible screenplay and a sloppy mess for most of its runtime, I can't really see myself ever recommending this to anyone.",2023-07-21
"It really makes me sad to say but I genuinely disliked this movie. 


Yes, it does have positives. Margot and Ryan were well cast, sets are good, some jokes were funny, etc.


However, here are some issues I had:

* The movie pretends to be smarter than it is while actively contradicting itself. Margot's Barbie has an existential crisis because she feels she is not beautiful or smart. She feels average because she isn't an astronaut, doctor, etc. But she learns it's ok if she's not because she's herself. Stereotypical Barbie is just a normal Barbie. Then, what idea does Farerra pitch at the very end that is so great that Farrell hates until he learns it'll be profitable? Average Barbie. The thing that exists and we spent a whole movie on: Stereotypical Barbie. She's not an astronaut or a President. She's just Barbie. She is a blank canvas for kids' imaginations. Basically, what Farrera had: a doll that reflected her turmoil. Farrera didn't need Depression Barbie or any specifically targeted one. She just projects onto the Barbie she has, which is what kids do. So, why is it presented as some genius idea that she just came up with? It already exists. I think they have a line about having the Barbie look average, after having a whole speech about women being criticized for their appearances (with diverse Barbies everywhere). Are they suggesting there is one standard of avergae? Is a Barbie that looks like Margot not average? How can you ask for an average Barbie while also trying to argue there should be no standard?

* The movie starts with Margot questioning death. This is not resolved. Ruth (a ghost, which actively contradicts this fear) shows Barbie what the world is like, but despite Ruth saying she wants Barbie to see reality, every single image she is presented is a positive. At no point does Barbie confront her mortality yet she chooses to be human. She also has no reason to live in the real world. She constantly mentions how uncomfortable she felt there. She enjoys the emotions that come with being human but she has those now whether she lives in Barbieland or not. Why would she actively choose a world that makes her feel ill at ease rather than stay in Barbieland where others are changing and she has friends. Ken now has emotions, and the Barbies are becoming more aware, so why leave?

* Barbie sees a woman on a bench who is old and immediately calls her beautiful. This is before she even starts on her journey of selfdiscovery. She has a breakdown later of not being beautiful despite seeing that beauty is not what she perceived it to be. This is completely done out of order. Why does a Barbie who screams at seeing cellulite just minutes before, see an old woman and just call her beautiful? Why was this not a scene later in the movie, when she comes back into the real world and has a new perspective on beauty standards? It makes no sense within that point in the story.

* Ken goes into the real world and learns about ""patriarchy"" but sees that the real world doesn't actually work like that. Kens have no jobs or positions of power in Barbieland, but women have jobs in the real world. He runs into a doctor, but he arbitrarily asks to see the real doctor (ie a man) because he just learned of patriarchy, despite having lived a life where women are doctors. He goes around and asks to do surgery but learns that he can't do that just because he's a man, he needs credentials. So, how is he still believing in patriarchy and trying to push it in Barbieland when most of what he has experienced condradicts it? 

* Ken is so inconsistent. He wants Barbie's approval but ditches her in the real world for patriarchy.

* The morality is off and the message isn't about creating a more unified equal world. When the movie started, I thought it was going to have some great parallels, especially when Ken calls out the inequality Kens face in Barbieland. They don't have homes, don't have any power, and don't get respect. He is filled with joy just by the someone asking him the time. That is a result of how Barbies have made Kens feel. Then Barbie goes to the real world and sees how life can be unfair. When they get back, Ken kicks her out of the house and says something along of the lines of, doesn't feel good, does it? Lesson learned, right? Nope. Barbie apologizes to Ken, but it still ends with them not wanting to give the Kens anything other than the bare minimum. The Kens ask for one position on the supreme court so they feel represented and are turned down and offered a lower position and told that they might get it some day. Why? Why is the message to be vindictive and exclusionary, rather than empathetic and collaborative. So, no lesson was learned from anything. This doesn't even reflect the real world where we have both men and women on the supreme court. If the argument is that well women weren't allowed to for a long time, does that somehow justifies these Barbies' actions? The message is power and revenge, versus working together towards a better future. It's also revenge in a world where the Kens, until this recent uprising (as a result of how they were treated), had done nothing to deserve being treated this way. The Barbies (except Margot) are acting on knowledge of a real world they have never experienced. They only know a world where they hold 100% of the power and Kens are accessories. Once again, Ken calls this out when he says to Barbie that it doesn't feel good being treated like a Ken, does it? The Kens are told to be themselves at the end but are not actually given anything in the world. Weird Barbie is offered a cabinet position with the President as a whoops, sorry we bullied you, but not a single Ken is offered a position of power. Once again, it seems morally wrong to have that be the conclusion of the movie. Shouldn't we be moving past these us versus them ideas? 

* The speech Farrera makes is so ham fisted. The Barbies in that world have no frame of reference for what she's talking about. They live in a world they control and where everything is perfect. Why is their brainwashing (never explained by the way) broken by her speech? They have never experienced those things. Also, Farerra makes comments about how women are constantly judged for their interests, looks, and actions. Yet, shortly after, the movie mocks the Kens for having passions such as wanting to talk about the Godfather or music. Her speech mentions womens weights and not having one standard. Yet, later, she proposes an average Barbie. The movie makers did not know what their message was and it shows.

* There is no consistentcy in how the movie is visually told. The Barbies are inconsistent in when they act like dolls and when they act like people. They walk on tip toe but they wave like people. Margot stops acting like a doll, except when she falls over in that one scene. The cars flip and we get a 2D dust cloud but we don't get that same artistic style when Ken gets pushed back by the wave, or any other moment of impact. Every scene seems individualized with no overarching stylistic connections or vision. Compare this something like the Matrix where Agent Smith and the other agents always have stiff and robotic movements. You notice it in the way they run, turn their heads, nod, etc. This movies picks and chooses based on what they need from the scene versus building a world that is consistent.

* Farrera is a good artist but it doesn't matter. The daughter doesn't like her mom because ...teenage angst? They both just make up with no actual conversation, other than the daughter saying her mom isn't a terrible artist. Farrera's husband speaks Spanish to Margot for some reason. Yeah, he was practicing it, but why would he say it to Margot? Why can't he just be a normal guy?

* I remember this being an issue when the movie Us came out, but I find it to be the same issue in this: the one-to-one between the two worlds is not explained and makes no sense. There appear to be no repeat Barbies in Barbieland. So, is Margot's Barbie specifically linked to Farrera, or every child that owns a Stereotypical Barbie? Because if it's the latter, are we to believe that only one Barbie in the history of Barbies (Kate McKinnon) has been played with so hard that she became weird? They mention others breaking in passing but never mention what happens to them. Also, Margot's Barbie ""breaks"" because Farrera is sad her daughter doesn't like her and she's having an existential crisis. So, kids playing with Barbies as they experience grief, loss, anxities, etc. just have had no effect, especially when one Barbie there reflects thousands of kids, except once? 

* Presenting consumerism as funny. They wanted Barbie's realization to come from Ruth Handler so bad that they wrote off Handler committing tax fraud as a joke. If this was Walt Disney, people would be lambasting it for the sheer corporate white-washing. That wouldn't be unwarranted so why does Handler get a pass? Barbie even takes her last name as her own at the end. It makes sense to honor the creator but also doesn't seem right to present a corporate felon as Barbie's guiding angel. Also, the WB Discovery building is predominately displayed behind the Mattel building. Then, Farrera is driving a brand new Chevy and also every car chasing her is a Chevy. That scene was practically a car commercial. And there are numerous people in this thread alone wanting a ""I am Kenough"" sweater. This movie is not breaking down consumerism, but perpetuating it. This is not a, well what did you expect from a movie about Barbie? thing. That would be fine if they didn't have whole scenes in the movie to paint it as some critical breakdown of consumer/corporate culture, ie the scene where Barbie first meets Farrera's daughter. Every negative comment about that is met with well Mattel probably made them do that, but any positive is met with Greta is a genius. 


It makes me sab because I wanted to like it.",2023-07-22
"Honestly surprised Mattel allowed a movie like this to be made, I would never have expected a Barbie movie like this to have been made. This went past my expectations in every way, I just loved it. It was much funnier than I expected, and also serious enough when it needed to be. The serious moments hit well, I kinda teared up at one point, and it didn't feel too cheesy or anything. I loved that they brought in the actual creator of Barbie as a character, I knew it was supposed to be her the first time they showed her, but I didn't expect them to acknowledge it and give her character a more extended role at the end, I figured it would just kinda be a cameo. 

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were born to play Barbie and Ken I feel, both of them were perfect casting (despite that one fourth wall break about Margot Robbie being cast in her role). The entire cast was great, but those two were just phenomenal. America Ferrera also felt genuine enough in her delivery to make her monologue work.

My entire theatre was full and the vibe seemed like everyone was loving the movie too, hope this is finally the summer blockbuster this year's been missing. But also idk how word of mouth will be, I feel like this movie might be very different from what a general person might expect from a movie named *Barbie*. Also it is very overt about its themes, which might put some audiences off.",2023-07-21
"Unironically a masterpiece. The message of the movie (leitmotiv) is immaculate and on point. Its such a refreshing and positive message in an age where the ""us vs them"" mentality is running rampant all over the world and everyone and their mothers can feel pressured to be or act a certain way to get those likes, reactions or positive comments.

Mattel made a LOT of BOLD moves on this one. From being the villains themselves, to the way they presented Barbie and her existencial crisis, to the way they developed Ken, to even the actual ending where they don't end up together and Barbz ends up becoming human. There were a LOT of ballsy decisions taken and I applaud every single one of them. It was so refreshing to see a company be this self aware, playful and being able to poke fun at itself. I've been in advertising meetings and I can tell ya, this is NOT an easy pitch lmao. Kudos to whoever made the decisions or convinced others to accept this tone.

Margot Robbie is iconic. I really think this could get an Oscar shout and Ryan Gosling was no slouch either. It felt like every performance, every scene played out EXACTLY as it should. The director should also be commended. Fuck it, everyone should! The dance numbers, the different sets and settings, the colors, the costumes, the different types of humor they used, the performances, the soundtrack and even the deeper message of it all hit just the right spot.

Its not often I finish watching a movie and think ""10/10. Not a single point taken."", but this was it LMAO. I did NOT expect a Barbie movie to hit the way this did. Iconic, fun and with an incredible message that's extremely relevant to current times.

"Was pretty good. Few changes I think might have made sense:

1. I think it would have been better if Barbies treated Ken's bad in the beginning of the movie. Maybe ignore them or just kinda mean, but not rude to them. I think that would added more characters to Ken's revolution. And it would make ""Barbie and Ken"" speech later more meaningful.  

2. Gloria's speech at the end relied on the real world too much.  No men treated Glora bad in the movie. Only person who interacted with her was real nice to her. And her husband seems cool too. While it was meaningful, it didn't feel that personal. 

Also, oddly enough all Ken's (and Allen) did great and that was the highlight of the movie for me. Especially the musical at the end.",2023-08-29

"It was an OK movie.   I smirked a few times but didn't laugh aloud. 

What makes me want to give this movie a 5 or a 6 is more like when I think about how other relatively mundane kids plaything movies developed vast and complex worlds and compelling plots.  Like I'm old enough to remember thinking it was the stupidest move possible for Hollywood to make a movie out of a Disneyland Ride. Or Legos. Or even the board game *Battleship*. And they're simply not even in the same league as Barbie they're so far advanced.   It's like the ultimate thing about this movie is that feminism is pretty boring, almost like this was a religious movie telling us nothing new about worn out tropes.  In terms of kids plaything exploitation movies I'd put Barbie at about the same level as *The Transformers* movies. Only with less odds of a sequel.",2023-11-17
"The movie was weird to me. I liked it, but still weird.

The movie was SUPPOSED to set forth an aspiration of gender equality in both Barbieland and the real world. But all that sentiment came secondary in focus to the fact, pushed incessantly that a men-run world (whether the real life ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù or The Kendom) is the embodiment of evil and instead of pushing for equality, the Barbies insisted on re-subjugating the Kens. They also remove the concept of Kens and Barbies pairing up, seemingly leaving all but Margot Robbie‚Äôs character without any sort of meaning or meaningful relationship in life.

Overall, I felt like you could take a couple of different, competing takeaways from the movie. In the real world, there is a fight going on against a male-dominated ‚Äúpatriarchy,‚Äù from which women must be liberated and take power. Yet when the Kens do the same thing when they are even more repressed in Barbieland, they are vilified and their work must be undone to restore Barbieland. That premise is never seriously questioned. Therefore, it follows logically that‚Ä¶ men in the real world should stop women‚Äôs efforts to gain their own rights and power? Or, should men just be subjected in both worlds? Obviously that‚Äôs not the intent of the movie, but the morality that it insisted on prescribing leads to implications that its creators otherwise wouldn‚Äôt support.

I didn‚Äôt feel like the movie needed to make any broad statements other than that women can do anything, can look different from one another, etc and that there‚Äôs no one blueprint for a woman (or anyone). I thought that was nice enough. Everything else felt forced and, as others have said, like a freshman‚Äôs gender studies paper. Not to mention all the out-of-place anti-capitalist rhetoric and weirdly calling Barbie a ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù",2023-07-22

"I'm confused.
I went in expecting something amazing and it was really just meh.

I did enjoy the attention to detail, the performances (especially Ryan Gosling's) were very well done. But the script was just so... meh.
 
I'm trying to understand if there was something more to it that I didn't understand? Like I got the commentary and Kens' issues and the parallel of real world and Barbieland. But like... Was that it?

There were quite a few moments that felt so random, I felt like the script was a mess. The dialogues either didn't make any sense or they were so in-your-face and basic, there were no layers, if that makes any sense. It felt like they were just shouting random things they had heard from feminists hoping it sounds progressive and smart. (I am a feminist, I'm not saying it's bad that they did that. Just that there was absolutely no nuance to the dialogue.)

I did tear up 2-3 times but they also felt random. I just walked out of the movie right now and I can't even remember why I teared up!

Btw, what was the scene where the corporate guys were running after Barbie? I get that it was a commentary on how men are not necessarily the most competent just because they are men, but it fell so flat.

I don't know. Maybe I just don't get this kind of humour.

Edit: I forgot to say, it reminded me of that movie ""Downsizing"" where they just touched on every single issue and the genre changed a hundred times and it was just so messy. That.",2023-07-28
"TBH I feel like people are trying desperately to assign this movie a central message when in reality doesn't really have a clear one. Yes it is feminist, but that still leaves much room for interpterion, as feminism itself can umbrella  many other ideologies under it and still be feminist. For example some feminists believe that we should live separate of our gendered counterparts and females live amongst females and males live amongst males, while other feminists believe the exact opposite. So this movie with its main goal being a feminist and empowering movie for woman, honestly feels like an absolute mess of feminist ideologies/perspectives that are never fully explored or explained. It felt like a fever dream, clips of whatever Gerwig though would be impactful. Personally even has an AFAB person, I did not connect to this movie whatsoever. Moreover, I rarely feel the need to bend to societal expectations of gender. I never thought I was powerless, or upset with men and I feel that a lot of the emotions they tried to associate with the ""female experience"", are actually just simply the human one. The speech that the mother gave felt extremely patronising, and she tries to connect the feelings of not being good enough to woman exclusively when again those feelings are just the consequences of being in a hierarchical  society.  Am I saying that women face no oppression? And that my personal experience is the only one valid? No of course not,  but by trying to make a movie that appeals to all kinds of feminists and woman ends up saying little to nothing.

Furthermore, with the reviews I've seen, no one can come to a single conclusion about what this damn film is even about. Is about Barbie becoming her own woman and learning to feel? Is it about girls reclaiming power and believing in their own femineity? Is it about men learning to take a step back for women? Is it saying that men deserve to be put into their place for benefiting from patriarchy? I honestly have no clue myself and when I stepped out of the theatre I was left with a massive headache trying to figure out what it even meant. Even the first thought that came to my head was, ""wow that sure was an absolute nothing burger of a movie"". And I actually do enjoy media with ambiguous narratives or complex messaging, LEGIT PERFECT BLUE IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. However with the Barbie movie, it didn't feel intentional on Gerwig's part, it felt disorganised and confused. Because with every interpretation for the Barbie movies message, can be contradicted by the movie,for example, Barbie the character was meant to explain the female experience? No but Ken represents the woman in Barbie land! Barbie is about accepting your feelings as a woman! Then why is Barbie a useless sad sack at the second half of the movie, what was she even supposed to feel, is she sad that she has cellulite now? Not every woman cares about their appearance like that. Barbie and Ken need to separate from themselves and find who they are, just like men and woman should! Main girl Barbie is the only one that does this and the Kens are still dependant on the Barbies, they are just ""Kenough"" now, yet they still don't leave the oppressive regime of the Barbies. Like what is this movie trying to comment on about the female experience? That it just sucks? That we need to rely on each other, but also need to be sperate of each other? What are you trying to say Barbie? That we need everything and nothing? Thats the female experience?

I'm sorry but I disagree, I dont think this movie adds anything to the conversation, just repeats and echos whatever is in the cultural zeitgeist of today. The female experience, or any experience for that matter cannot be defined by a single movie, my female experience will be vastly different to my moms, to my cousins, any other female commenter who reads this post. I don't feel hopeless, actually I feel more enraged that this is how I am expected to feel about my circumstances as a woman. That I have to bend my ideology and perspective to fit into whatever this movie wants to say about my life and role in society, that I have to relate to Barbie or Ken or whoever character was meant to represent the females in society. This movie is just an arthouse version of a corporate movie to make Mattel seem progressive, but by making Barbie seem to be the very first Fashion doll for girls, is already erasing so much female history. I am not going to explain it all, but there are multiple doll makers before barbie, and an excelent video that explains it is Mjtanners ""How Mattel Rewrote History To Put Barbie On Top"". Anyway, I just dont like this movie, its lack of actual concrete message, and how it panders to capitalistic fodder.

I can also name 3 other projects that capture the female experience much better than Barbie could

Perfect Blue- very graphic but very real depiction of how woman are treated in the industry and in society, and even if you arent a woman you can still relate to the MCs experiences of being watched and judged for existing

Madoka Magica- Can be read as a metaphor for how girls are expected to mature and take up jobs that mistreat them, and blames them for their own personhood, leading to mental illness

"[HEAVY SPOILERS]


Overall really good, the message of how hard it is to be a woman was kind of beat to death, but I enjoyed how they still made it fun with that block hit hammer message going on as long as it did near the end of the movie. The female Barbies, barbies owner, the Executive board; they were all interesting to see.

Seeing Barbie have emotions for the first time, and have difficulty knowing what they were was refreshing. Since, in the beginning, everything was ""perfect"", a little too perfect if you ask me. Very goodüëçüëç

My favorite part was Ken singing ""Push"" and having an emotional breakdown because Barbie didn't want him. His constant smolder and his overall desire for Barbie to want him back was intriguing because we found out that his identity is tied to his relationship with Barbieü´£

 I like how, in the end, he and all the other Ken's realized that they are not extensions of Barbie; they are Ken. The way they made Barbieland more equal was amazing since they realized they didn't want to recreate the inequality of the Real World.

Very good, exciting movie. Ken's cringiness just made it better. Music was great, very funny

"Literally just got home from seeing it so it's still all very fresh. I will say that I enjoyed it to a degree that outweighs any of the issues I had with it. The amount of care and detail that was put into every aspect of it is commendable and just off of that alone I think it counts as a job well done.

I think the worst possible thing they could have done with this film was left it in the hands of a person who didn't care about doing anything unique with it. There was a real opportunity here to make it into something original, surprising, and meaningful, and I think Gerwig, along with the whole cast and crew, really succeeded with that. And because it's a movie about a massive cultural icon like Barbie, it could have easily been sloppy and vapid and still made a lot of money and had people enjoying it, but they went the extra mile with it and made something of actual *value* too. I think I just walked out really appreciating its existence more than anything.

The main things I had issues with were the overall tone and meaning of the film. I found myself on a personal rollercoaster ride in terms of how it had me feeling from scene to scene. I just found it a little hard to get into the groove of it or something. I'm also not a person who enjoys things that are too ""on the nose"" in terms of messages being delivered in art. I just felt the movie could have benefited from being a little less self-aware  because it did kinda ruin the vibe of certain moments for me. It was an obvious reflection of the issues women face in our world, and I think that was a great choice and very appropriate. I just personally enjoy reading between the lines a bit more.

I also found that with how much was blatantly given to the audience in terms of the films message, I somehow walked away not really knowing what the message was??? Is it about the importance of equality or that women should run everything?? 

Anyway, it's still fresh and I think I could definitely benefit from another viewing of it. I also feel like all of its imperfections added a certain beauty to it as a whole and the fact that it's sparking so much discussion is maybe half the point.",2023-07-26

"(Spoiler alert). 
  
   
I don‚Äôt know why but I feel sad and disappointed that Barbie became a human at the end. That the whole movie was about saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre enough‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt feel perfect in the perfect utopia created just for her ‚Äî why would the real world be any better? 
  
And also it felt a bit meh like the whole Kendom thing was annoying and I wish it was more just a movie about Barbie discovering the real world (the ups and downs) and then having this crisis about which she wants to choose.   
    
I see some people missing some of the more subtle feminist takes like ‚Äúhurrr why after Ken cried they say the Ken‚Äôs can‚Äôt have a spot on the Supreme Court but only a minor role as a magistrate judge first!?‚Äù ‚Äî read up on feminist history pre 1950‚Äôs even (I know it was bad in the 50‚Äôs too and even now but I‚Äôm talking about before we could be independent of a husband like having a bank account, not being allowed certain careers etc and yes I know some  countries still have very restrictive practices for women please don‚Äôt pick at me for choosing an arbitrary decade!) that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been for women ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt study medicine but you can become a nurse!‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay now women are doctors but you‚Äôre not going to be strong enough to become an ortho surgeon‚Ä¶ stick to dermatology, general practice and psychiatry‚Ä¶‚Äù (Also you hear comments like that even this day and age, some med specialties are still an old boys club).  
  
Margot Robbie is literally gorgeous and perfection ‚Äî can‚Äôt imagine a better Barbie.  
   
I worry for young children being taken, the message might be completely lost on them/too boring.  
   
A ‚ÄúBarbie discovering the real world‚Äù type movie would definitely have been able to appeal to kids with more kiddy jokes and adults with some more subtle jokes.. I‚Äôm imagining a lot of funny ‚Äútoilet humour‚Äù scenes, coughing her plastic lungs out on a bong or something lol but I‚Äôm sure Mattel had a lottttt of strict rules in the way their product could be portrayed which might also explain some peoples questions regarding the script. 
  
Btw for what it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm a late 20‚Äôs female (just so I don‚Äôt get any incel comments etc for not being amazingly blown away by the film like I  was so excited and pumped for and hoping to be.   
  
Also I‚Äôm sad there will be no more promo being done now it‚Äôs released (duh) because Margot‚Äôs stylist was absolutely killing if with all vintage Barbie outfits he had her in.  
  
Also is just me or were most of the jokes in the trailer? Or made to feel more important than they really were like the choreographed dance to Dua‚Äôs song like I thought we would get to see way more ‚Äúall the Barbies dancing!‚Äù scenes.  
  
Lastly: I know most people ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî have enjoyed some new original cinema being made and not just a Something Something Movie The Third being made (except Shrek all those movies smash) but would anyone else be keen for a Barbie 2 where maybe she does live in the real world, experiences it all (crazy night club scenes, boring job scenes, The Joys of Having Genitals scenes, living with Sachs‚Äôs family, experiencing love/grief/anger/happiness as she goes along whatever and then deciding she wants to go back to being a Barbie? Idk shy it‚Äôs bothered me so much she‚Äôs become a human?",2023-07-28
Man this movie was so funny especially Gosling. My packed theater was somehow dead apart from one dude laughing at all the jokes but it was a 10pm showing so I guess that might have factored in. Still a funny and lighthearted movie that tackles some important issues.,2023-07-31
"I'm seeing a lot of people disliking the resolution to the Barbieland conflict. How it all goes back to the status quo and Kens are still under the matriarchy.

That's kinda the point, right? I saw it as a rather crude message. 

Yes, the Kens have this moment when they realize they can be whatever they wanna be and their existence should not be dictated by their relationship to those in power. It's a cheesy sequence when they come to believe anything is possible... only for things to go back to exactly the way they were when it comes down to it.

Kinda like how a woman would feel walking out of the theatre..

"The movie tries very hard to be clever but keeps nothing from the viewer. The message is rather obvious. It's a lot of wasted potential for me.

I liked the little things, but the movie as a whole - oddly bland.",2023-07-21
"Making a Barbie film, on a surface level, seems like an incredibly simplistic idea. After all, there are dozens of animated renditions of the same old stories.¬†

But what if you wanted to go further with the idea? What if you wanted to question what Barbie really was? Barbie dares to ask ‚Äúwhat is the impact of this plastic doll?‚Äù Greta Gerwig took on this tough idea, and truly went for it.¬†

As most reviews of this movie start off, I am not the target audience. I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy, what do I know about the modern woman‚Äôs experience, or Barbie dolls, or anything, really? ¬†The movie did have a tagline, ‚ÄúIf you love Barbie, if you hate Barbie, this is for you‚Äù. Well, what if you‚Äôre indifferent to Barbie?

‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù truly shines in its set design. BarbieLand is incredibly interesting to look at. It crafts a plastic world, the logical conclusion of a real world dollhouse. Even the pool isn‚Äôt real water, and it‚Äôs fun to see the two leads interact with the world in spite of its stillness.¬†

Margot Robbie plays ‚ÄúStereotypical Barbie‚Äù, and who else would you cast? The movie even pokes fun at this idea. Margot Robbie is the human Barbie. And she really leans into it in this movie. She moves and acts like a Barbie doll, down to the way she runs, and floats down from her dream house.¬†

But the gem of this film is Ryan Gosling, playing Ken. He goes all out. This is an all star performance. Ryan Gosling IS Ken. His expressions are hilarious, he is seamlessly able to make so-so jokes hilarious. His venture into and out of the patriarch idea is masterfully handled. It‚Äôs balanced enough to get laughs and make people think without ruining the positive tone of the movie.

A common criticism I‚Äôve been seeing of ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù is Mattel‚Äôs role in the movie. Will Ferrel‚Äôs character, and the board of executives in general are somewhat of a pointless inclusion. This is mostly true. They don‚Äôt really move the plot along. They don‚Äôt do much. But in spite of this, they still manage to have some very comedic scenes. In my opinion, the movie is better for their inclusion. The ‚ÄúScooby Doo‚Äù esque chase in the Mattel building is total cartoonish fun, and a joy to watch play out on screen. ¬†And the inclusion of Mattel does give a pathway to the emotional core of the story, where Barbie meets Ruth within the offices.¬†

There are some flaws with this movie, however. The messaging is very heavy handed. This often works in the movies favor. After all, who sees ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù for its subtlety? But it‚Äôs also often a detriment to the movie. It can occasionally come off as preachy, and often causes issues with the tone of the movie. That being said, there is a very sweet and funny scene near the end between Ken and Barbie, where you truly feel some improvement for him as a character.¬†

Some of the jokes also just don‚Äôt really land in the movie. There were jokes that just left the theater in silence. And this was a common issue in the film. I‚Äôd say half or less of the jokes truly landed.¬†

But despite these missteps, I do think the world is a better place with Greta Gerwig‚Äôs ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù. There‚Äôs a nice heart inside this movie, and a lesson that plenty of people need to hear. its not afraid to poke fun at itself, and it‚Äôs not afraid to go for it when it feels the need to. It‚Äôs a vibrant, positive, and fun movie. The world deserves more ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äùs. P",2023-07-22
"People are taking this way too seriously. The film is great. It takes its themes and has a lot of fun with them and then brings them back around towards the end and starts to acknowledge some of the mens world veiw too. It seems people are only focusing on the setup and not the resolution of these themes.Then, the ghost of Barbies creator says, ""People make up these terms like the Patriarchy to deal with the stugles of every day life"" which was great, her character was great and really represented how extreme people take things over something nice like a toy for girls thats meant to inspire. 

Margot Robbie was awesome and showed a range of poignant emotions.",2023-07-22
"Sorry to betray Ryan Gosling but I think they should have saved Ken and patriarchy stuff for a sequel and just kept it about Barbie and the nature of toys, make-believe, and growing up.  The movie was 100 minutes, they needed to pick one plot and stick to it.  As it stands the movie stretched itself too thin trying to be too many things and it just lost me.",2023-07-23
SUBLIME,2023-07-23
"Maybe it's just me but this movie was the ultimate have your cake and eat it too.

They criticize Mattel for having mostly males in charge, but it's made by Mattel. Is Mattel actually changing their policy, or do they think if they lampshade it, it's fine?

They even go as far as make a point about how Hollywood actresses are unrealistically beautiful but they still cast a Hollywood beautiful actress.

The ending is.... Barbie becomes a real girl? What's the message there?

I feel like they pointed out a lot of problems in society and the company but it doesn't really go anywhere with it. Ultimately i guess because it cant. You can make a satirical barbie movie to try to push for change within Mattel, but Mattel itself can't make a satirical movie pushing for it to change itself, and then not change.",2023-07-25
"I feel like the movie was overhyped tbh (and like, to be fair the marketing was ON POINT) but the way ppl talked about it saying they cried etc etc and how it was SO moving had me thinking I‚Äôd feel something.

Spoiler alert, I didn‚Äôt feel much. 

It‚Äôs cute. It‚Äôs pretty, I loved the dancing and musical numbers (basically everything in Barbieland) and the attention to detail but the message was a bit ham fisted or ‚ÄòA lesson on sexism‚Äô for babies. I felt like they could‚Äôve added more depth but then again, it is for kids so ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",2023-07-27
"I'm very sceptical about this movie. It has conflicted with a lot of philosophical and political ideas I keep and I'm not really sure it's a net positive for societal norms. 

My first point of scepticism is the ending. If feminism is about equality between the sexes, and this movie wants to be a clear proponent of feminism why end it with the Barbies in control once again? I feel like the movie has disingenuous intentions to the viewer here, where it starts off trying to take an ethical stance and advocate for the correct behaviours but then flips it all on its head where the ""happily ever after"" scenario ends up being one of the sexes over another. Division between the sexes shouldn't even be a thing here - we are all human and our differences and disagreements are solved through understanding, not spitefulness. It's not ""because guys are in control in the real world, we will be in control here"" it should be ""because guys are in control in the real world, we will show them we can do better here, and build a society equal for all"".

Second thing was the way Barbies emotionally manipulated the Kens against each other. As much as Kens were clearly acting wrong in their patriarchical society (as indicated in the movie plenty of times), It felt as if the retaliation by the Barbies was also wrong -  exploiting their feelings of love to achieve their end goal. However, absolutely zero reference was given that this behaviour was incorrect in retrospect. My concern is that younger people see this and start thinking that it's ok to play these kinds of games to get what they want from others. In the end what Barbie did, telling Ken how she truly felt about him after he was also honest about his feelings IS the proper way to go about things, but I take issue that the exploitation of the Kens was passed off in a neutral to positive light, and hasn't been criticized more.

I had several other facepalms throughout the movie that were less important e.g. the fact that Ruth in wanting to prepare/warn Barbie for the difficulties that lie ahead in her new life as a human, shows her images of laughing people and pure joy, no suffering or pain whatsoever. Felt like the writers lost a good opportunity to tell the audience that life cannot be all rainbows and sunshine's all the time, and you just have to endure and persevere sometimes. Maybe these aren't worth mentioning that much though.

Overall felt like the movie had potential to be something great but ended up confused in its messages. I did appreciate Barbies and Ken's identity crises and how they navigated through them, eventually helping each other and building a true bond that transcends sex, but looking at the movie as a whole, feels like it does more harm than good, and it kinda annoys me",2023-08-21
Me and my sister were laughing so hard when the opening was basically a parody of the ape sequence in 2001:A Space Odyssey,2023-07-21
"I have to admit that I was a little confused all the time. On the other hand, the movie wasn't supposed to be any logical. All the songs felt a bit unattached to me but I guess they had their purposes. Some scenes were funny but not as funny as what I thought after reading some reviews. The movie wasn't boring but seeing it once was enough for me.

Someone here pointed out that 'Barbie' felt a bit like 'Lego Movie'. I had the same feeling especially after seeing Will Ferrel as CEO.

I found it cool that the characters were based on real Barbie dolls. Also the actors did a great job.",2023-07-21
"I really wanted to love this movie but it was too chaotic. For example, why did the CEOs go into Barbieland in the end? A bunch of scenes were rushed and/or unnecessary. And the overall message and separate quotes from the movie didn't bring anything new to the table. I was hoping for a more profound dialogue or character arcs, but it was all very repetitive and childish (which was probably what they were going for?). I'm still trying to process everything in my mind, but in my opinion the high points of the movie were the acting, production and visuals, not the script and directing.",2023-07-21

"I enjoyed the subtle-not-so-subtle aspect of the radicalised Kens reducing their Barbies to non-committal committed relationships and the Barbies expected to just go along with it. Something I see my fellow women go through a LOT, making do with absolute scraps from shitty men. When it was Barbieland, the Barbies just don't look at Kens in a romantic sense, but when it's Kendom, they are cornered into a ""bare minimum"" relationship while being relegated to second place accessory in all areas of life. Damn, Greta! 

I also felt that the glaring gap in men's modern societal identity was highlighted when the only way Ken can really find himself is to just be himself. I don't know if this is entirely the answer for every guy but I think it's a worth considering. You are you, you don't have to completely leave yourself behind to fit society's toxic idea of masculinity to be a ""real man"". Something about how Barbie leaves Barbieland behind and gains autonomy and Ken stays because he found himself outside of the romantic/societal expectations of men.

I really loved the moment where Barbie was shown everything being a girl and a woman is then just says ""Yes"".

"I might get flak for this, but this account is anonymous, so here goes. I loved the movie, I found it very funny and touching and the OST is a blast. (No, this isn't what I think I'll get flak for lol). The big patriarchy speech, you hear one of those on TV or in movies from time to time. And I'll admit, sometimes (not always), as a man, I feel like it's an attack on me, and I feel like it's unfair, because I don't cat call, and if my buddy catcalled, he wouldn't be my buddy for long. Sometimes these speeches feel like they're unfairly putting something on my shoulders. This one didn't feel like that at all, I don't know why.

Of course I didn't understand or really feel a lot of what she was talking about in this speech. I'm not a woman, I don't know what it's like to be a woman in our world. But it was like, yeah, I don't really *get* it, but that must suck, I'm sorry you're going through that.

It‚Äôs kinda weird to me that Ken is her boyfriend and she doesn‚Äôt love him and they‚Äôre still Barbie and Ken? I get that that‚Äôs the point, but it still didn‚Äôt make a ton of sense to me. Dua lipa being there for a full second was ?? 

I agreed with parts of the monologue about how hard it is to be a woman, but then at other times I was like ‚Äúmaybe stop trying to make everyone happy?‚Äù

"Am I the only person who thinks that the Barbie movie's message might have gone in the wrong direction?

I went to see the movie with a couple of my friends and firstly, holy shit it was so colourful. Just based on the style and humour I would say that it was a good movie. But then there is the message.

Just ignoring the main plot for a second.

The entire movie was just barbie not treating ken right, ken discovering that other men can treat him better than barbie, leaving barbie, and then establishing ken land (With the completely forced plot of brainwashing). Then the barbies instead of talking about it comes up with the idea to first give the Kens the best of their lives by giving them attention, then immediately making them jealous by hanging out with the other kens to make the Kens fight. The kens obviously make up and don't fight for too long, and then afterwords when the main ken explains to barbie that she didnt treat him right and all he wanted was some form of attention and validation she just said go figure it out urself lol.

And at the end the barbies all take control over barbie land again and remove the kens' power. Then when the kens go to the barbies (after learning their lesson) and ask if they can get some spots in the supreme Court and police and shit, the Barbies just say no.

They actually just made full circle.",2023-07-30
"It was a movie with great visuals and genuine laughs, but I found the feminist message really muddled. Some of it rang true to me, and some of it really didn't. 

It paints gender politics as a zero-sum game; either men are winning or women are. The happy ending is the Kens continuing to be oppressed, just slightly less? I mean, I know some of it might be a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it didn't quite read right to me. 

When the Barbies are trying to take back their homes, they emotionally manipulate the Kens against each other, suggesting that women only have power through men, and not in their own right. Really not my idea of an empowering message.

I kind of left the theatre thinking... Is this what people leaving the theatre are going to think feminism is?",2023-07-31

They had to name drop that beer (forgot the name) three times, and showcase Duolingo. Not to mention that the whole thing was itself an ad for Mattel.

Fucking choked up at that bench scene where Barbie noticed that a woman being able to visibly age and live a full life is something beautiful and admirable

"Did nobody find Barbie‚Äôs plot very problematic?

Barbie was an excellent film. Very entertaining, great acting, great set pieces, everything. 

However, I actually found the plot very problematic and I am surprised no one else feels this way? 

No I don‚Äôt have an issue with the feminist themes. I think it is incredibly problematic however to make the goal of a film‚Äôs protagonist to reinstate a power asymmetry.

The Ken‚Äôs are happy at the start of the film, but they have no power. The land is ran by Barbie‚Äôs, all important jobs are held by Barbie‚Äôs, and Ken‚Äôs aren‚Äôt even allowed in the dream houses at night. 

When the Ken‚Äôs take over, it is Barbie‚Äôs goal to reinstate the Barbie regime. 

So to reiterate, a marginalized group‚Äôs rebellion against an oppressive regime is quashed and that is the happy ending? Even at the end of the movie when the Ken‚Äôs ask for a Supreme Court judge, they are told no. 

I fully expected the return of power to have some Ken inclusion, although I realize this may undermine the message of the movie.

This is not a male - female dynamic that is problematic, it is a group based power dynamic which is highly problematic when applied to other groups. 

I was personally a little shocked that the goal of the protagonist‚Äôs was to reinstate a hegemonic power. 

I know some people are calling this movie too ‚Äòwoke‚Äô but I think it is actually extremely unwoke in this way.",2023-07-29
"I can't believe I'm about to say this earnestly, but Barbie is a real W for Warner Bros. Discovery, toy-to-film adaptations, and Michael Cera.

This is what has been missing from cinemas: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have a great time. This is how satire is supposed to be done; reenact a complex idea using simple characters. To me, this film challenged gender roles using hyperfeminine/masculine dolls.

But that's just an episode of television. The thing that really elevated this film was bringing characters in and out of the real world. This type of fourth-wall break is usually excessive and blunt. But I think it served as a good barometer of what we think the world is like VS what it is actually like.

That Zack Snyder‚Äôs JL reference üòÇ,2023-07-23
"I enjoyed the movie (loved the first half, liked the second) but my main gripe with it is that at the end of the day the main criticism that people throw at barbies and mattel wasn't deeply explored: **the beauty standards and body norms set by barbie dolls.**

Sasha, the teenager who used to play with the barbie, basically fits all those beauty stereotypes. It would have felt very different if we had seen a girl who did not fit those body norms making the comments that she did, and showing how her life had been impacted by the cultural expectations that toys like barbies set on young girls. 

Plus, when she throws her criticism at Barbie (that she was a bad influence on girls growing up by setting unrealistic beauty stereotypes) what we see is  Barbie crying and saying it was never her intention to make anyone feel bad. Making Barbie a real person with feelings sort of acts as a way to make us feel bad about Sasha criticising her directly, as that is like criticizing an individual woman rather than a object, which is a way to make those comments hit differently and feel less pertinent.

The rest of the movie is an exploration of the effects of patriarchy and of male toxic masculinity over both men and women, but it never directly or deeply addressed the question of how body standards set by barbies affect women's body image and, most importantly, **what should be changed by Mattel to prevent that**. 

Fundamentally, the whole patriarchy plot and *Real World vs Barbie World* just felt like a way to discuss those topics in a very generic way that doesn't address the specificities of how Barbie influences young girls and just sort of throws blame at the entire society and at the 'patriarchy' without recognising blame in the brand. 

I get that this is a movie made by Mattel and obviously they wouldn't want to criticise the product directly, but it still feels frustrating as a viewer to see them trying to escape responsability in any serious way.

At the end of the day, if you go to most shopping malls today to the dolls sections, basically all the barbies you will find there are still the ""Stereotypical"" Barbie. Even in the world of the movie, which was obviously trying to be inclusive, you look at the barbies in barbieland, almost all of them were gorgeous, and basically all of them were very thin, with only one or two exceptions. 

I really wish brands would make real concerted efforts to create truly body positive products rather than shifiting responsibility or simply virtue signaling.",2023-07-23
"Honestly the more I think about the movie the more realise how the messages aren't as simple as it seems and it's way more satirical and self aware then anyone sees.

This is just my take from the film and it's clearly polysemic.

But i think the films real thesis is ""Barbie solves misogyny is a dumb idea"" and it's laughing at that.

It's a film that is fundamentally against itself and the entire idea of corporate feminism that brand is built on. Multiple times in the film Barbieland talks about how Barbie has made the world a better place for women. Which is clearly ironic and a laughable notion. The film constantly makes ideas like girl power and patriarchy the butt of the joke. All the ideas about gender presented throughout the film besides maybe Gloria's and Ruth's points were laughably stupid. Because the characters are brainless dolls made for 4 year olds. No matter what Barbie does people are not happy because that is reality.

A normal non self aware Barbie film would have ended the film with Barbie instantly fixing all issues and instantly granting gender equality and making everyone happy. Which the film was parodying with it's ending but in the real world feminism doesn't work like that. The audience is supposed to laugh at the Barbies' solution, not agree with it. Because in the real world feminism is really hard, it's complicated and messy and often does seem hypocritical like the Barbies are presented. And most importantly feminism takes time, lots of time, huge eras of history and it's still not sorted out for everyone. It's not something you can put a pink bow on and call a day like brands like Matel would want you to think.

This is a movie that portrays it's own studio as a bunch of bumbling fools who want to push feminism above everything else despite not understanding at all. Which matches so much of modern media.

I honestly feel the film is more Anti-Corporate Feminism than it is Anti-men. Whilst at the same time being a piece of corporate feminism. Which lots on people on both sides of the feminism debate are failing to see because they are incapable of seeing feminism as something that's not perfect or evil. Which is why I compare the movie to Starship Troopers which people thought had a simplistic view on war that it really didn't.",2023-07-25
"i feel like a betrayer to all womankind - i did not like the movie üò≠ i was super super excited for it because i'm a girlie girl, i love greta gerwig, i love margot robbie, and i love a good social commentary. 

i went into barbie expecting to get a poignant story wrapped up in pretty pink packaging. and the packaging sure was pretty!!! the barbies are stunning and the set is gorgeous. but the monologue that made everyone cry did not resonate with me at all

maybe it's bc i'm not born in the west, but my experience with misogyny is more like i'm expected to be Docile Wife as opposed to Skinny Girlboss. to me, a life where i'm expected to be a career-driven leader seems pretty out of reach. in my world i struggle with all of my accomplishments being dismissed as nothing. i can't relate to people having high expectations of me, or asking me to account for mens mistakes, or needing me to be a kind leader, bc no one expects me to be anything really",2023-07-28

"I liked the set design for Barbieland, and a lot of the initial story in Barbieland although it felt a bit odd. When Barbie was in the real world and feeling emotions and seeing human connection was beautiful, Margot Robbies illustrating Barbie feeling the emotions was great and Ryan Gosling performed great with what he was given

I felt the feminist stuff was too loud, I'm 100% not saying there shouldn't have been any feminist messages but show don't tell comes to mind and the opening monologue and Gloria's speech and the bringing the other Barbies back to their senses were screaming ( but i believe that was the point!).

I think the last third was a bit of a mess and lost me when they got back to Barbieland it felt like they had a checklist of messages they wanted to tell and squeezed them in at the detriment of the film as a whole.


I think the film would have benefitted if the girls/ and or Barbie stayed to help in the real world as Barbieland was meant to mirror how the dolls were being played with and I think the film was at its best there.",2023-08-04

They spend a not insignificant amount of time showing a Chevrolet commercial, just a bizarre choice. Insanely corporate film littered with Lin Manuel Miranda, 2016-ass politics, where we soapbox about the problems we face while winking at the fact that this is a corporation perpetuating many of these same problems. 

I've seen twitter accounts handwaving the depth of the feminist message by saying its meant to be for children or for people who have never engaged with any left leaning feminist thinking. I don't know what to make of that, this idea that its done poorly or shallowly on purpose. It's a weird movie. For every decision that I liked and really enjoyed it feels like there was one that was absolutely repellant or did not land at all. I don't know who this movie is for, yet in that I think it loops around to being for anyone. it is a mirror, with several possible readings and interpretations possible as to what the messaging is meant to be. I cannot decide if this is the films greatest strength or its greatest weakness. It simultaneously flaunts a myriad of possibility while holding you at arm's length, laughing that you dare engage critically with a movie about toys.  I think its nowhere near Lady Bird or Little Women, but the more I sit with it the more confused I feel about it both in positive and negative ways. The whole viewing experience has become pretty ironic for me in that I came into it expecting a complex portrayal in the vein of Lady Bird/Little Women hidden under Barbie aesthetics, was met with hamfisted in your face depictions lathered in Barbie aesthetics, yet find that the messages in their simplicity do not form anything resembling a perfect puzzle, they contradict and they twist meanings as you hold them side by side.

Idk. I have it sitting at a 3/5 rn but I feel like I need to watch it again, drop my expectations, and maybe just engage with it on its own terms. I will say the first 20 minutes and the final 10-15 were excellent, I just feel like the middle hour connecting those two portions was just weird",2023-07-24
"Did anyone else totally hate that Barbie decided to become human in the end? Was that implied to even be the big decision she struggled with throughout the film or was it just thrown in at the end? I wasn‚Äôt expecting that to be the ending and if I was, I would‚Äôve rooted for her to stay in Barbieland. It would‚Äôve contributed to the idea she was enough, she could still be stereotypical Barbie along with many other things in Barbieland. Idk. For pure fantasy, I would‚Äôve preferred she stay a doll.",2023-07-24
I didn't like it. I think there was so much potentially for it to be good but it was kinda all over the place. I was confused for a lot of it. The funny parts were funny but the story wasn't there for me. I will not be seeing it again and I'm bummed there was so much hype about it,2023-07-25
"It felt a bit scatterred to me. Lot of nice elements, but the movie didn‚Äôt really gel well as a whole. Like what was the whole barbie in a box thing?  Was it worse than just going back to Barbieland (which she did anyway)? Why did Alan turn into a random fighting machine? Why did America Ferrara just go vigilante when all her executive staff was chasing her? The toy to human connection is what? You get to Barbieland by roller blading in Venice Beach? So many things you shouldn‚Äôt question so much in a good movie. But they did even say in the movie ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think about it too much‚Äù hah, which was def a message to the audience. Think of movies like Elf or The Matrix and they don‚Äôt have near as many logic questions, you just buy it cuz they are good.",2023-07-25
Is Barbie worth seeing just solely for Ryan Gosling? What percentage of the movie is he in?,2023-07-25
"This might be controversial but I wish they went harder with the dance scene. 

I loved the movie overall and the message and everything, but they kept blurring the line between musical and not musical and I kind of wish they fully committed to it being so musical. I kept hoping for a bigger wow moment, but maybe my expectations were too high. Let me know if anyone agrees.",2023-07-25
"i absolutely LOVED this movie and would totally watch it again, however is it just me who finds it extremely ironic for feminists (which is a movement i completely support) on tiktok saying that ken made them really angry? because if im not wrong ken represented women in the patriarchal society, which are what feminists fight to support. and the amount of people saying that barbie was the most morally right character when she literally represented the patriarchy just makes me so confused, because the way i see it, barbie isn‚Äôt better than ken and ken isnt better than barbie. 


and something else i‚Äôd like to add is i dont understand why they go back to the matriarchy at the end, because when they said something about not letting kens have a higher up job in society, when surely the end goal for barbieland is equality? 

idk can someone just explain all of this to me

also sorry if this is worded really badly its midnight where i am and im so tired lol",2023-07-26
"I thought it was an ok movie, I felt like if it was a bit longer it would've helped explain some of the bits better.

It wasn't as thought provoking as I was led to believe.

Edit:

What was the point of the corporate dudes? Like outside of comedic effect they really didn't do....anything?!",2023-07-27
"Watched it last night.

Loved about 75% of it but I feel like the writing fell apart at the end.

I didn't like the scooby doo style chase scenes in the cubicles and the executives being stopped by a turnstyle. I felt like they were trying to make the real world more serious compared to the imaginary world and these scenes kinda muddied the waters and erased any threat the executives posed because you knew they were stupid. Which might be why they basically wrote them out of the movie after that. (they were right behind them going into the imaginary world but somehow didn't show up until days after the others did?)

The Kens, Allen, and weird Barbie were definitely the highlight of the movie. 

Overall I'd say it's a 7.5/10",2023-07-27
Saw it tonight with my wife. I'm a 42-year old man. I loved everything about this movie.,2023-07-29
"I loved it. The Kens were almost in the exact same situation as the women in the real world, and vice versa. Except in the real world, there are actually three sitting women supreme court justices, lol. But overall it was pretty realistic. Also, everything is more plastic and fake in the Barbie world.

The tactics that they used to take the world back from the Kens was turning the Kens against each other over sexual competition, just like gender flipped a mirror of the real world.

The movie promotes racial harmony, with Sasha 'cancelling' Barbie in an early scene but in the end comes around to working together with her. It also suggests that the Kens' wars between men are less important than the gender wars. I'm not sure how realistic that is, but it does try to hit home that ""gender is the real struggle"".

I love how the message of this movie is, 'women are people', women are human and not Barbies. Barbies are just a two dimensional reflection of the real world. The reality is that groups with less power get to be ""less human"", since their humanity is suppressed or ignored. So Barbie choosing to become human in the end was the only possible ending that worked for this.",2023-07-30
"I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this but oh well....

Did anyone else kinda find it hilarious that the beach off sequence & ""I'm just Ken"" ended up being the ultimate "" Bros before Hoes"". 

This, coming from a film called Barbie, made mostly for a female audience,where the crucial element of the Barbies return is turning Kens against each other, happens to have guys rise above their squabbles over women. I just find it sooo cognitively dissonant in regards to the film and I love it",2023-07-31
"FINALLY got to see Barbie last night and managed to avoid all spoilers and most trailers. First off, I'm a middle aged dude and a big fan of Gerwig's work (especially Lady Bird). I prepped for this movie by watching Little Women, American in Paris, and Singing in the Rain (A+ movie, btw). 

Overall, I thought this movie was a great time and one I could recommend to almost anybody (similar to this year's Spiderverse). I thought the self-awareness and Gerwig's brand of humor was well suited for this type of project. Most reviews I read echo this, but I think this movie was spot on when it was in Barbieland and has an incredible opening act. It gets super messy when it enters the real world tho, specifically any scenes that involve the board. It started to feel like one big commercial for Mattel, Warner Brothers, and the Chevy Blazer EV, which had me afraid we were entering Space Jam 2 territory. It also didn't help that a good majority of the songs made for this movie were by Top 40 artists (Lizzo, Khalid, Dua Lipa, etc). That's not to say licensed music is a bad thing in a movie, I just found the execution distracting here, at least in the first half of the movie. Minor complaints aside, I thought weird Barbie was hilarious and Mckinnon crushed it, America Ferrera's monologue was great and is a great summary of the movies theme, and both Robbie and Gosling were absolutely perfect for their roles. I think if you were to cut out all of the Mattel board stuff and either flesh out the mother/daughter relationship a bit more or just remove the sharing memories with Barbie thing, this would be a much tighter movie. But that didn't stop me from loving it! I mean, it's a popcorn flick with actual effort put into it, so credit is due. 

If you know what a Barbie is, I think you should check it out sometime. It's fun! 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è",2023-08-01
"Ken's ""storyline""; like bro how tf did one dude overthrow the matriarchy in barbieland? Getting the Kens to change is one thing, but to get the Barbies to go along? I still don't get it. It was convenient for the plot, but it doesn't make sense.

Margot Robbie has a whole existential crisis about what it means to be a woman in the real world. America Ferrera is reconciling the romantic idea of what barbie meant to her childhood with the reality that other little girls faced when presented with a barbie. I thought there was going to be something of a mother/daughter story, but that never really fleshed out. 

I understood the themes pretty well but it was kinda unfair that so much was cut to make this film 2 hours. The result is okay but you can tell that there was more that wanted to be said and shown.",2023-08-01
"I think the movie was very good, a lot of fun moments but I feel it slightly missed the mark to get into great territory.

EVERY scene with Margot and Ryan was amazing, I wished we had even more of those. There were a few subplots that I didn't particularly care for. The daughter + America part felt underwhelming.

Also while I do get the female empowerment message of the movie, I think it was a little too on the nose done at certain points via just flat out saying it. Showcasing it through scenes / events would've been better IMO. A case of ''show don't tell''. 

Finally, really wished that Humans wouldn't have been able to get to Barbieland. My hope would've been for Weird Barbie + Allan + Stereotypical Barbie to rescue the other Barbies from Kendom without other input.",2023-08-02
"I went to see the Barbie movie last night and really enjoyed it. Many complex ideas and feelings were portrayed in such a clever way. Cried a couple of times, obviously the heavily emotional parts like Barbie/Ruth scene or the scene at the bus stop when Barbie starts to soak in the human experience by watching people argue, laugh, and then turns to the old lady.

But also when I saw some of the emotions I‚Äôve experienced being portrayed and described to a whole audience. I felt validated. It was almost like a hug. So many things about being a woman can‚Äôt be said or explained because people don‚Äôt believe you, or think you‚Äôre being emotional or you‚Äôre blowing it out of proportion. Like when they arrive at the real world and how Barbie feels self conscious, how she gets assaulted, the comments the police officers say about her, etc. 

Another good one, for instance at work, if you‚Äôre dismissed and have  tried to talk to people about a certain issue, and people just go ‚Äúhave you tried talking to the higher ups? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll listen‚Äù. As a woman, yes you try but hardly ever gets to anywhere.  They kinda show this in how Gloria tries to stop the dude from going in the meeting. She knows the rules and is expected to follow them. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go in, they are in creative meeting‚Äù then the dude just walks in. Yes, they make fun of him and try to dismiss him. But is still given a chance to talk, made me wonder how many times Gloria was even called out for only knocking the door. 

Anyways, I could go on, but this morning I realized that a lot of my coworkers went to see it last night too, and i am really not looking forward to have a conversation about this movie with them.",2023-08-02
America Fererra‚Äôs monologue?!?!?! God damn amazing,2023-08-07
It was good. A lot messier than I was expecting with all the praise.,2023-08-07
It was ok,2023-08-08
"I'm just going to say it, this movie should have been  named Ken

Its Not only that Ryan gosling just shined in every scene but I would say that Ken's character has way much change and growth than barbie.",2023-08-29
"To those who didn't get any aha! or haha!
moments, well, this movie wasn't made for you. Not every film is for everyone.

I've always been pretty much in the middle between a tomboy and a girly-girl. I wasn't allowed to have a Barbie growing up (my dad was certain it would make me vain and materialistic), but I played with them at friends' houses. Still, I wear makeup and like to dress nicely, but the only pink thing I own is a gifted pair of dangly earrings.

My best friend was in town on opening day of the Barbie movie. We figured it would be light, silly, girl-centric fun, and thought, Sure, why not? We located maybe the last two tickets in the county, as every other theater was sold out for every showing.

Well. We. Loved. It. We played the Spotify soundtrack all afternoon. We quoted lines from the movie all week. I took another friend on her first social outing post surgery. Then my elderly mom wanted to go, so I took her. And another friend wanted to see it with me, so I've ""accidentally"" seen it 4 times. Each time, I notice more details. And still love it.

It's funny, uplifting, pokes fun at outdated traditions, sparks memories of childhood play and innocence, and scorches the impossible task of being a perfect woman, with truth and humor. 

A few of the tropes seemed forced or gratuitous, such as gagging at Barbie's flat feet, the ""White Savior Barbie"" comment, and Ferrell's character inexplicably mentioning Jewish friends and referring to himself as a mother -- twice!, but these record-scratch moments were thankfully brief and few. The eye-candy visuals, well-placed music, and the message that women are much more than their looks, by far outweigh the negatives, in my opinion. Ryan Gosling looked like he had a blast in this role, and Margo Robbie as Barbie could not have been better cast. It is a sentimental romp, with teeth, and it clearly resonated with millions.",2023-09-06
It was...fine?  Opening scenes were fun and great eye candy.  Plot was heavy handed and all over the place.  Not getting what all the hoopla was about.,2023-09-17
"This may be a simple take, but I think it is accurate. I think the main goal of the movie was to promote barbie as well as make money. I think they poured a majority of the funding into hiring well known actors and toeing a super controversial line as much as they could while offending nobody and everyone at the same time. People thrive on controversy and polarity. If you look at the social media, you can see the the most promoted videos and topics are the ones with the most comments. More comments are driven by polarizing people. I think the barbie movie aimed to do just that. It's a clear promotion of feminism while sprinkling a bit of pro-men's ideas in here and there. Lines like ""human's made up the patriarchy"" and ideas like manipulation from women strike from the opposite angle. This portrays the idea that the movie is in fact a satire. Think about it, isnt satire usually pretty obvious, at least in more than 2% of any story? But then the rest of the movie heavily doubles down on pro-feminist ideology. Honestly when I tried to see both of these ideas at the same time, I was just confused. On one hand it seemed to scream pro-feminism, then on the other hand it screamed satire. I know ideas are not mutually exclusive, but this seems to be one of the times that they are. Barbie probably doesn't care at all how you feel about feminism or men's issues. They just want you to keep talking about it and fighting so that they can generate more buzz, leading to watching the movies they make and investigating the company they have. As they say in show business, ""there is no such thing as bad publicity.""",2023-12-25
I honestly wasn‚Äôt a fan. Plot was all over the place and it felt kind of preachy. 4/10,2023-07-21
"Holy shit that was great.

Every joke landed.   It was absolutely wonderful writing and acting.   The meta of it all wasn't overdone and had easily a top 3 joke in a film littered with great humor.

Rhea Pearlman was a fucking delight and every moment she was in, she and Margot had remarkable chemistry.  Genuinely felt like a mother daughter connection (from Greta Gerwig?  Who could have possibly seen that coming? /s).

Every Ken was fantastic but I kept laughing to myself over the Sex Education Barbie/Ken pairing.  

Though of course Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were phenomenally well done rivals and Gosling absolutely slayed with his comedic timing, singing, and just overall wonderment....and God the horses.

Margot Robbie was ABSOLUTELY the right choice for this and not to shit on Amy Schumer but there's no way that version of the movie would have been as good as this.  Margot hit it out of the park with the full range of emotions and 3...even 4 dimensional aspects.  Got the mannerisms of a Barbie doll down during the running scenes especially...it's the little things like that that really elevated this movie. Plus as I said earlier her chemistry was great...with EVERYONE.  From the random Midge to Ferrell to Aaron.  A beaming light of energy.   But her best moments were with America Ferrera who had maybe her best film role since Real Women Have Curves.  Those two were electric and again Gerwig captured the essence of a girl and her doll and the love between them.

I'm sorry to gush but I fucking adored every second of this movie.

Also...I've only had Allan and the Zak Snyder's Justice League joke for only 2 hours but I'd die for both of them.

Oh...poor Matchbox 20 catching massive strays in this movie. 

9/10 for damn sure.",2023-07-21
"I enjoyed the movie but do think it was way too heavy-handed/preachy. (Though I did like the monologue from Americas character and it stated the contradictions of expectations for women so well)

I think personally the better story here would‚Äôve been to focus more on the ‚Äúperfection‚Äù angle of Barbie and the standards women strive to fit. Covering the patriarchy as a whole was too big for this type of film imo and if it would‚Äôve just been about Barbie not being ‚Äúperfect‚Äù - and her learning to not just accept that, but appreciate it - then I think it would‚Äôve made her choosing to become human more impactful/logical. My favorite scene was her telling the old woman on the bench that she was beautiful. There are no old women in Barbie land, no wrinkles, etc. yet Barbie thought she was beautiful. To me it‚Äôs the first hint that she is different and when she admires everyone in the park, you get why maybe she‚Äôd want to be ‚Äúreal‚Äù too. Even though everything isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpretty‚Äù 100% of the time. The ken patriarchy plot was not really worth it to me but that‚Äôs just my opinion.

For Mattel to acknowledge that even while being ‚Äúempowering‚Äù Barbie still has to be ‚Äúpicture-perfect‚Äù and the way real women try to be that in every facet of our lives, would‚Äôve been really cool and the better message here to me.",2023-07-25
I feel like I‚Äôm in the minority. Didn‚Äôt connect with it but appreciated how well it sold the fantasy.,2023-07-21
"The tone of this movie was so all over the place but I suppose that‚Äôs the point. Barbie‚Äôs song being Indigo Girls and Ken‚Äôs being Matchbox 20 was fun. Margot and Ryan were great. Some just absolute pure cinema moments, like the bus stop scene, mixed with zany stuff like whispering the message to will Ferrell was disjointed to me but overall great somehow pulls this off.

It‚Äôs weird to have such an LOL funny movie along with what it‚Äôs saying on a larger scale but for the most part it amazingly works.

I was almost crying laughing during the beach off and then actually crying when Barbie makes her choice. Just solid.",2023-07-21
"I fkn loved this movie!!! One of the best I‚Äôve seen in a long time. 

Can anyone type out the whole quote about Ken wanting Barbie to be his ‚Äúlong distance committed low key girlfriend‚Äù or whatever the quote is? I‚Äôm desperate for the exact quote and cannot find it on google üò©",2023-07-22
"I wanna be fair, I took my niece (36m) and tlshe loved it, which is all that mattered to me. 

I always pictured Barbie as the girl that became successful because she dreamed and worked on it.  I think the whole Mattel plot was completely unnecessary.  I also like the mothers speech (to an extent).  

But I'm not sure I get the whole concept of where this movie was going.  Like it's anti patriarchy, but in ways, anti-feminism (Ken's didn't wind up getting equality unless I missed something). Like anti-Fight Club but only by what guys see Fight Club is (and missing entirely on male fragility). And  that's fine I guess. It is Barbies movie after all.  I did like the costumes and the performances.   And like I said, she liked it.  So its fine.",2023-07-22
"That musical number for Ken is just unfair. I was waiting for Barbie's big moment but it felt like it never came. 

Ken gets this big, extravagant character defining moment where he works out his conflict with other Ken and himself through song. 

It was funny, it was well made, Greta didn't disappoint but felt like it was missing something.",2023-07-22
"i really loved this movie despite the flaws in the plot. 

what i loved about this movie: the set and costume design was perfect. barbie land was magical, the pink was amazing. margot robbie, imo, was the perfect stereotypical barbie (and absolutely stunning). ryan gosling was truly amazing as ken, he was the funniest part of the movie. he leaned into the patriarchy jokes so well, he did it in such a way that had an undertone of sarcasm which made me feel through the screen like gosling knew how ridiculous his character was (if that makes any sense?). i loved the inclusion of ruth. and overall, i loved the feminism of this movie. 

what i didn‚Äôt love about this movie: no offense, but i thought america ferrera and whoever played her daughter were the weakest part of this movie. their acting was not great and was kind of corny imo, and their writing/storyline wasn‚Äôt even great either. i understood the overall message but i thought the plot was just messy at some points. it felt like no one really had a purpose, it was just barbie suddenly realizing she wanted to become human. i really really wanted to like the monologue and the montage of women at the end, but i felt like it wasn‚Äôt explained/written very well so it lost it‚Äôs emotional impact. 

overall, i‚Äôm forgiving the at times messy plot because of the way the movie made me feel, the happiness i felt in barbieland, the nostalgia, and the acting from margot and ryan.",2023-07-22
"I'm not the best at catching all the small tidbits in a movie, so I'd like some help if anyone can provide it. I am a man.

The speech from the Mother about what women deal with, and how it is used to de-program the Barbies took me out of the movie for the few minutes it was applied. Not because I don't understand societal pressures on women, but because I didn't catch how these pressures were displayed on the Mother, or even Barbie, on a societal level. I'm not connecting the dots between Barbie's issues where she's failing to be the toy she's meant to be and how we're suddenly on all the tiny social rules women have to follow, nor how those rules would fix the Barbies since they all live in a Utopia with none of those pressures.

Did the movie build up to that speech well? Was it just liked by everyone because they relate to it? Outside of that section, I enjoyed everything about the movie.",2023-07-23
Just like a man to completely steal the show in a Barbie movie.,2023-07-23
"I liked it. It was funnier than I thought it was going to be. I liked Barbieland, the dance scenes.  Margot was perfect as Barbie and Ryan was great and funny as Ken. I love how the guy says patriarchy still exists they just hide it better. And the Kens playing the guitar thinking the Barbies just love sitting and watching them for 4 hours.....lol.

It's a fun, funny, colourful movie, not to be taken too seriously, with a great message that kids will see too, both boys and girls, and explains the problem of patriarchy to kids in an accessible entertaining way.",2023-07-23
"I'll come off the bat and just say that I had a lot of fun watching Barbie. Although Oppenheimer is the better of the two, Barbie made a better impression on me because of its tone, themes, and passionate cast. You could tell from the introduction that the film's entire cast and production team had an amazing time making this film. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu are having the time of their lives filming their scenes, and they don't attempt to hide it either. 

As for Margot Robbie, Barbie cements her status as one of Hollywood's most gifted, modern-day character actresses. She is the life of this film and it's rather uncertain that anyone else could have elevated the starring role like she had. There are small scenes where she enhances the emotional impact of the circumstance her character is placed in. She will no doubt be seeing a number of nominations this fall and next winter.

Now, let's discuss the story. Barbie is about the title character going on a journey of self-discovery after experiencing a bout of unorthodox symptoms. Turns out, the girl who used to play with her is undergoing a midlife crisis. Now, it's up to Barbie and a stowaway Ken to make things right. 

The film presents its story in a linear fashion with two distinct POVs in Barbie and Ken. There is a lot of comedy and weird ""out of time"" moments both leads face, but the crux of the film is how both react to their experiences in the real world. Barbie develops an existential crisis when she realizes that her female-led utopia is actually molded by a board of men. Ken, who's being revolves around Barbie, is changed by the male hierarchical nature of the real world and he returns to Barbieland with his newfound ideology in hand. The film ends with a direct repudiation of the patriarchy that is conveyed through a speech and a proceeding music video set to a tune that's reminiscent of Queen's ""Bohemiam Rhapsody."" The story is enrapturing. Not one scene divests the audience from the film, especially when tensions ramp up. 

Greta Gerwig deserves as much adoration for this film as Margot Robbie. Her approach to this film is unique, fantastical, and heartfelt. The use of dance numbers contrasted against some emotional moments keeps the film afloat. One thing I appreciated that Gerwig did is the use of costume changes for the emo zoomer teenager, Sasha to convey the growing mother-daughter bond between Sasha and Gloria. The history lessons and easter eggs are nice too.

Overall, Barbie offers an exciting time in the theater. It's an excellent film that conveys a message of identity within a gender dominated society. Ryan and Simu are having a blast in this film, and the energy the cast gives off enhances the film. Margot and Greta are no doubt the heart and soul of this film, respectively, and they both succeed in making an enjoyable, fun film from a toy and its legacy. See this film at least twice.

"After seeing Barbie, which I liked well enough, I KNOW there will be a sequel and frankly I think they should flip it and explore the male/boy side of things with G.I. Joe and how guys (or rather me and my brothers) played with toys buy burying them in the mud, drowning them in water, blowing up the enemies. And also explore how those stereotypes effected us.

It would be really interesting to see Barbie enter another realm of toys different to the one she ""grew up in"". And examine how boys and girls handle things playing together and apart.

And it starts with the whole concept that boys toys are called action figures and Barbie is a ""doll"". And how barbie (and the dolls) have many roles but but with G.I. Joe there and most other action figures there only two roles either hero or villain. There is no lawyer G.I. Joe or teacher, or dancer, or painter or chef etc. Just army dudes who are good or bad.",2023-08-01
"I think when presented it seems like a basic film- plot and a lot of underlying elements of social constructs.

However, all the stuff that was done prior to that in which some people are saying was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for ken to feel/have happen was a great example of how females feel IRL! I mean ‚Äúomg a world where men aren‚Äôt appreciated?!?!‚Äù imagine how we feel.

That said, people are complaining about how the Ken's are treated as an underclass, and while it can be seen that way, I thought it was a play on the bimbo stereotype and how women were portrayed in old-school films, for example the James Bond movies where Sean Connery would tell a woman to go away because it's time for ""man talk"" and then slap her ass as she was walked away.",2023-07-23

For a movie about Barbie‚Ä¶it was good.,2023-08-08
"Comedy was pretty good and Ryan Gosling carried hard, however the message feels extremely confused here. The film very obviously tries to express topics such as feminism, patriarchy, power, and gender roles, however I feel like the way these themes are addressed is strange.

Ken somehow single handedly brainwashed everyone in Barbieland with some books, which created Ken's Kingdom, essentially the male mirror to Barbie land. The Barbies serve a similar role to what the Kens originally did. They seemed to be pretty happy with what was happening, but didn't seem to have free will, similar to the Kens in the original Barbie land.

Instead of the film actually exploring the issues in a patriarchy, it just boils the entire thing down to the Kens doing ""Manly stuff"" like having trucks horses and beers. It attempts to make a parallel to how things originally were when the Barbies were in charge and ""every night was girls night"", but now with Kens patriarchy ""every night is boys night"". However when the film concludes, instead of going for something equal at the end, they just opt to go back to the matriarchal version of Barbieland, with the Kens eventually getting more equal if the Barbies feel like it, ""Just like women in the real world""

Why do they even do this? The whole point of feminism is for women to be equal to men, not to create a female dominated society where the Kens are goofy muscleheads who can't do anything. If Barbie land is just the female version of Ken's kingdom then why does the show portray one as right and the other as wrong? Why not settle for something equal?  I know it is supposed to mirror real life and reverse the gender roles on feminism movements, but still I feel like this was unessesary.

My other issue was that the film very casually brushes over and glorifies what is essentially emotional manipulation. Like one of the main plans that happens is for the Barbies to lead one Ken on, then during an intimate moment start texting another Ken, to make them angry and to manipulate them to fight each other so they don't get to vote the next day. And the film fully endorses this and it's seen as a good thing to do. Yay, great lesson for the kids to learn.

Overall I liked the movie but I feel like it would have been better if it was less serious and calmed down on the social aspects. This whole movie feels like they started writing a script about Barbie entering the real world, but then they decided to add ""fuck the patriarchy"" in there as well, but they didn't implement it well at all.",2023-07-21
"Am I the only one who hated the movie? The jokes were so childish, the 'real world' emotions that Barbie felt were filmed in such a stereotypical way, and they made everything too over the top? The whole thing basically was just like ""oh the patriarchy is bad!"" - no shit. But it didn't make any efforts to go further than that? I just feel like Greta (i.e Little Women) is much better at storytelling than this... I don't know. Maybe I'm just miserable.",2023-07-21
[deleted],2023-07-22
"I felt like the movie was such a missed opportunity to deliver a great message because it failed in its execution.  


Ryan Gosling absolutely stole the show as Ken, and I found his arc and character much more interesting compared to Barbie and wish we had gotten a longer and deeper look into Ken's psyche and the relationship between Barbies and Kens. Also felt the film's resolution went by too quickly and could've been improved with more nuance into the more sinister aspects of patriarchy.  


Instead the movie got too heavy-handed with the messaging and missed the boat on 'showing' instead of 'telling'. That entire speech on patriarchy, while absolutely correct will still not land as well as Great Grewig might've hoped, which ultimately is a problem.  


A little more subtlety and nuance would've gone a long way into making this a much better film and landing its core message better.",2023-07-23
"I found it really average :/ Would give it 6/10. My friend and I left the theater agreeing that it was fun but we wouldn't go see it again. 

I thought it was funny for the most part, but I'm not seeing where or how it touched so many people. To see reviews saying they cried or Barbie nailed how it felt to be a woman was weird cuz I didn't feel that way at all as a woman. I also don't get the praise for America Ferrera's character.I feel like they didn't flesh her out at all or her daughter. They don't explain why shes having thoughts of death and depression. They kind of brush it off with her saying shes weird and dark, but those sound kind of serious so I thought there would be a story there. Even her daughter they introduce her as this queen of mean that Barbie is warned about but never follow up on that... So I guess shes just mean because she's a teenager? Like the characters have no motivation. They are just plot devices so Barbie interacts in the human world and so they can help deprogram the other Barbies. 

Then honestly, it wasn't super woke. I will say it got awkward and too on the nose somewhere in the middle. It just became word salad about patriarchy and being a women. It made me roll my eyes. I think they were already hitting on the point by being funny and just telling the story like earlier in the movie. Even so, I wouldn't describe it as this feminist weapon against men. Just slightly annoying with the not subtle social commentary. Then, the rest of the movie is just for laughs. My favorite character was Ken honestly. Ryan Gosling nailed the role and made the movie entertaining. Margot Robbie was great too but again too many on the nose scenes with her.",2023-07-24
"This probably is not a popular opinion I guess but I was somewhat disappointed with the movie. I went in knowing it would be a fun and feminist movie but I couldn't connect with the movie. It felt messy? The mother- daughter duo were just introduced, there was no time spent on developing their characters or making them familiar to the audience. I honestly don't know what their purpose was. When the mom gave that speech, it felt very generic and not very genuine idk. I had so many questions. Why was the mother depressed ? Did the kens put a spell on the Barbies? How did the speech break the spell ? Because for barbies all these real world women trouble would be completely foreign. I get what they were trying to show I guess but felt it was all over the place. Ryan gosling stole the show! Margot was amazing as well but I feel like she should've delivered the main dialogue because the Americas delivery wasn't very impactful I guess. Margot could've delivered the hard hitting emotional dialogues better imo. Please tell me I'm not the only one üò≠ Barbie being Greta's movie I was looking forward to it because I really liked her previous 2 movies that I watched which portrayed feminism in a subtle but very powerful way. This seemed like a big miss to me but the sets and everything was amazing. It was a good fun watch I guess.",2023-08-03

"Incredibly convoluted.

The message of empowering women was SO INCREDIBLY on the nose and preachy that I started to think it was a satire of a satire. Perhaps I gave Gerwig and Baumbach too much credit because even when analyzed two levels deep the message is still so unclear and confusing.

Gerwig has already written incredibly personal stories that place the viewers into the characters shoes before. Barbie feels so much more distant compared to characters from *Lady Bird* and *Little Women.* This film has way too much telling, and no showing. It‚Äôs sad because Gerwig has already proven that she can make a personal, subjective experience with previous films.

"I think this movie offers a delightful fantasy experience with its clever satire, attention to detail, and intriguing outer and inner story arcs. While the second act had some flaws and occasional pacing issues, overall, the movie succeeds in captivating both teen and adult audiences alike. The portrayal of Barbie's self-discovery journey and the message of acceptance and empathy resonate well. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the movie manages to keep viewers entertained throughout. It's a refreshing take on the iconic character, reminding us of the importance of embracing life's complexities and finding beauty in both its highs and lows.

**There‚Äôs one line in the movie that I didn‚Äôt catch that I have been thinking about recently. That specific line was said by the voice-over, which I think was Helen Mirren (?), that mentioned something about Margot Robbie as an actress. Was it something about the decision of casting Robbie as ‚Äúthe perfect Barbie‚Äù? I can‚Äôt really tell. I think it was in the second act, but I might be wrong.

The film‚Äôs hilarious but it also has a solid message within, even if it comes off as preachy at times. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are just the perfect pair. Wish that more big companies will let filmmakers give their creative spins on different existing IPs",2023-07-29
"I'm pretty surprised by how bad it was. Great sets, great costume design, but ultimately a very compromised and thematically incoherent film. Ryan Gosling may have been the best actor in the movie, but his acting was ultimately one-note.

I think there are elements of the movie that could have made for something great. The subtext of the opening homage to 2001 is that Barbie was not only a product of the sexual revolution, but someone who helped usher it in. Young girls (""moms"") are portrayed as playing with baby dolls, only to smash them when a giant Margot Robbie appears. Beautiful, sexy, and more free with her body, the scene efficiently communicates that the pill allowed Barbie to shape beauty standards, but also who women could aspire to be. The rub, of course, is that Barbie ended up reifying new patriarchal expectations of women. That the film ends with her saying, ""I'm here for my gynecologist,"" shows that the effect of women being able to control their reproductive health is on Gerwig's mind. The movie, unfortunately, is just not as interesting when it communicates its ideas through dialogue. It can't follow through with what it sets up in that opening minute.

I found that the movie's pivotal scene‚ÄîAmerica Ferrera's speech about the double standards women face‚Äîto be poorly acted and written, like a TikToker plagiarizing a Twitter thread that was published in those halcyon days when we thought Hilary Clinton would beat Donald Trump. It was cliched, unconvincing, and hollow, much like the dialogue between Ferrera and her daughter. My fianc√©e and I couldn't believe that Gerwig wrote such a false mother-daughter relationship, when *Lady Bird* opened with one of 2010s greatest scenes. We were also baffled by the film's resolution in Barbie Land.

Particularly with a trans actress like Hari Nef cast, one would think that Gerwig would be more interested in challenging gender roles. The happy ending in Barbie Land undercuts whatever she tried to say. Barbie Land as a matriarchy is of course supposed to make men reflect on how women can feel boxed in under a patriarchal system, but the film happily concludes with women having much more power than men, acting just as oppressive as men in the real world. Were the movie thematically coherent, if it actually had something to say beyond platitudes, it would show a world where men and women live in a society where things are equal. I don't know what that would look like, but it would be far more interesting to see what Gerwig thinks is possible in a movie with sets as fantastic as this, instead of one that is dully like our own.

I'm very disappointed in this movie, and Gerwig's future work makes me sad for the state of the industry. I'd much rather her make grounded, honest films like *Lady Bird*, with solid budgets, than ""subversive"" adaptations of corporate IP. *Barbie* today, Netflix's *The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe* tomorrow. It is a long march through movies that are marketed towards adults, but which have all the complexity of tossed off children's novels.",2023-07-21

"This movie didn't land for me really at all.  I loved Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken.  There were a few genuinely funny moments as well.

Additionally, the main message of this movie seems to be that men are keeping women down and that women can empower themselves by manipulating men?  I like to think that I'm pro-women but this felt like it went a bit too far.

"There are so many parallels between the Barbie movie and The Matrix movies

Barbie is actually Neo.

There were other characters that are an homage to Morpheus, The Oracle, Agent Smith, Cypher, the Architect, just to name a few. 

I think particularly one scene that stuck out the most from the Matrix was when the oracle points to a sign hanging on the wall that reads ‚Äúknow thyself‚Äù in latin and much of the Barbie movie seems to center around this theme. 

There have been many iterations of the Matrix as we know from the conversation between Neo and the Architect. 

The first Matrix designed by the Architect was perfect but it‚Äôs doom was inevitable (just like the first iteration of barbieland). Barbie inevitably becomes depressed Barbie and the whole world comes crashing down.

The second Matrix was based off human history to accurately depict human nature, rife human hubris (the proposed Ken-land). Which also fails.

The answer to a subsequent matrix was ‚Äústumbled upon by another, a more intuitive program‚Ä¶ to investigate aspects of the human psyche‚Äù where the subjects in the matrix accepted the matrix if they were given a choice.

"Greta Gerwig‚Äôs Barbie is the perfect concoction of summer blockbuster and satire which goes through a hilarious tale about A barbie who believes herself and existence to have solved the woes of women, but enters the real world to see otherwise. The shock and the satire create for a fun filled ride along the way.

The most beautiful part about this movie is that it never takes itself seriously. There is not a more than two minute sequence that takes itself serious. It‚Äôs the perfect comedy that acknowledges many of the flaws of the society we have built, it‚Äôs inequalities, consumerism, capitalism, sexism, and more.

I truly appreciated that the point of the movie doesn‚Äôt end up that patriarchy is bad as someone may expect with how Barbie understands the real world. The movie moves onto show Ken recreating a patriarchal world in Barbieland which stems from him feeling oppressed and living in the shadow of Barbie. There is a necessary discourse laced with the right amount of fun satire through Ken‚Äôs journey. He is always in the shadow and his existence has no meaning without Barbie, which he deserves to change. Everyone has that right to be themselves, and as a society we should thrive to create a world which is moving towards such equality but as with everything this takes time. The movie acknowledges this reality in a beautiful way towards the end saying hopefully the status of Ken‚Äôs will come equal to that of women in the real world. The smart dialogue which packages the satire and the themes of the story truly helps it.

The movie deals with the idea of dominance and the film wraps this idea with a story that shows you why we should move away from someone having the upper hand. This is all topped off by the literal ending (I loved how meta this movie got) given to Barbie where it shows that we truly can be what we want to be. The movie does this all in a tone that at times feels like I am navigating through r/ELI5 rather than in a movie. Regardless the move has some layered writing with witty dialogues and satire. It doesn‚Äôt try to change the world but show the world as it is for the most part though the overarching narrative does nudge us towards progress for creating an equal and happy society.

The world of the film is beautiful. Greta Gerwig excelled in creating this world of Barbieland and how they represented Mattel (was thoroughly surprised by the level of criticism they got away with giving kind of shocked me). The colors popped as much as we wished it too, but I was a little worried about whether the hot pinks and bright colors would get too much but surprisingly never had that issue. I was sucked into the world and had fun every second, didn‚Äôt even remember that I brought snacks to eat. The board room design was also really fun and had me laughing at how the board members operated, loved Will Ferrell in that role.

The soundtrack of this movie is unexpectedly good. I loved every second of the song they broke into in between the Ken War. They didn‚Äôt miss the writing even in song. I can‚Äôt help but remember the lady behind me in the theater who couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. I was waiting for the It‚Äôs a Barbie Girl song and was so sad I needed to wait til the credits but happy it finally arrived. My mom who listens to little Western music came home and asked me to play the songs which is a great sign.

Honestly need to talk about the performances. Margot Robbie was Barbie, I can‚Äôt say anything more. The movie says it well with a note by the narrator honestly calling out the irony considering Margot Robbie. Ryan Gosling have one of his best performances as Ken, never even thought this would happen. I was surprised by the amount of weight his character had. I was mad that I didn‚Äôt know Michael Cera was in the movie, and was so happy and loved every second of him as Alan (makes sense that I wasn‚Äôt aware of his presence in the film). Will Ferrell is a legend and he has little screen time but kills it with what he has. America Ferreira was just great as a mom who is just leading a plain life but wants something representing her as the most common kind of person. I loved her venting which brought the Ken-struck Barbies back to their senses, it‚Äôs my head canon that it was improv as well. So many great performances, a sign of a fantastically made film which is all I expect from Greta Gerwig.

Overall, it is a well made summer film that surprised you with some great satire and fun. It was a great movie to watch with my family and have fun together with characters and themes that stay with you.",2023-07-24
"No one knew what Greta Gerwig was going to do with ""Barbie"" and in the end she did everything. In the good way. Best way I can sum up the movie is ""Barbie finds herself"".

"I thought there were fun elements to the movie, but overall the story and execution were a little off throughout.  Judging from my theater, which was packed, I‚Äôd say most felt the same also.  Not a lot of big crowd reactions as I had hoped.

"Warning: Many spoilers.

I really, really wanted to like this movie. I'm a big fan of Barbie and fashion dolls in general (I make OOAK dolls) and there's been so much hype in the doll community about this! But I spent most of it just... disappointed.

First, some positives. There's so much attention to detail in regards to set accuracy and Barbie history! The obnoxious neon rollerskates were so perfect. The fridge being filled with stickers was so funny. The way Barbie brushed her hair and teeth was a great visual gag. All the costumes and many props are based off real Barbie items, and some of them are very obscure. It was fun looking at all the eye candy. 

The Barbie and Ken lineups were beautifully diverse. Although people usually picture Barbies as blonde, nowadays there's a huge range of body types, heights, and skin colors, and it was great seeing that recognized.

And there were some genuinely funny moments. Alan's moment in the spotlight, the nods to discontinued dolls, and the entire concept of Weird Barbie were great.

Also, wow, a lot of the actors were giving 100% and it shows. 

However, pretty much everything I liked were related to sets, costumes, and references -- mostly cosmetic. And I'm upset about that, because dangit, I really wanted to like this.

So... The movie sets up the Barbie world as very unrealistic, overly idealized, and silly (as it should be), but the real world is equally silly. There needed to be a strong contrast between the idealistic, perpetually perfect world of Barbie and the ""real world."" But there isn't. (Aside from colors, they did a great job on that.) The Mattel employees are like a parody (tickle fights??), but... the Barbie world itself is already a parody. 

The ""real people"" don't really have any logical character growth or motivations. The teenaged daughter hates her mom, so her mom is thinking about death? Why? And how does it get resolved? We never see them even talk it out. It's just... suddenly fixed at the end. 

And now, the big message. This is meant to be a feminist movie. The thing is, feminism is... not about women being above men and taking over everything. Yes, the patriarchy is real and a problem, but the problem is simply reversed in Barbieland -- and even in that idealistic world, they can't find a solution that involves equality. Heck, Ken is supposed to be funny for feeling dissatisfied that he doesn't have a house, he's not allowed to have any career, or that his own girlfriend treats him like an inconvenience. Those are big issues! And it makes sense he feels unhappy! But none of these issues are solved at the end. The Barbies just celebrate that they took back the power, and the Kens have basically nothing again.

Speaking of Ken, he just... wasn't likeable. Ryan Gosling was giving it his all, but the character just went from pathetic to obnoxious and back to pathetic. (His musical number was great, though.) Honestly, Pixar handled Ken's character better in Toy Story 3. He should be Barbie's unwaveringly dedicated supporter, satisfied to do nothing but adore his beautiful girlfriend. (And she should... actually like him? She doesn't seem to in this movie.) 

I think they could have handled the Barbie world in a funny, satirical way, while still respecting (and developing) the established canon that people enjoy. And I think they could have also made powerful commentary on lack of equality in the real world, while still having a Barbie-centered plot. Unfortunately, this movie didn't accomplish either. And I'm sad about it.",2023-07-22
It is interesting to see how people with not a favorable opinion of the movie are getting downvoted into oblivion.,2023-07-22
"Honest thoughts, I think I made a mistake watching this a day after Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is in a higher tier artistically and was much impactful and made it more difficult to take in Barbie.

I'd give Barbie a 6.5.

Cons:
* I found it hard to parse the point or message of the movie. Felt like there was a couple conflicting lines that were competing for each other.
* Margot Robbie was a bit flat in the movie. Even when she was supposed to be sentimental and feeling it didn't  necessarily hit, although maybe this was by design. 
* Not sure what several parts of the outside world added to the movie. What did Will Ferrel's character actually contribute to the film? He was hardly a villain. Or Ferrera's daughter beyond a half scene?
* Brief cameos didn't really add to the movie. And the movie was overmarketed, which I think is skewing reviews.

Pros:
* Set and costumes 10/10, great take on the Barbie world
* Music and sound 10/10. The musical scenes were great, and I think Greta can tackle a full on musical. 
* Ensemble cast generally did great. Standouts are Weird Barbie, the 2 main Kens and Allen
* Hysterical moments in between, especially in the Kendom part. 

I'd recommend watching Barbie before Oppenheimer and with at least a couple days before watching it. I'd recommend this as part of a cultural event, but I don't think it'll have much replay value",2023-07-23
"It's pretty funny how all of the film's supposed ""subversive"" stuff is just milquetoast mid 2010's social commentary that's been showcased endlessly in all major media for the past decade, meanwhile the only character with an actual arc, and the one who gets all the big moments, is just Ken. 

If people think the ridiculous culture war around this movie is bad now, just wait for the awards season when Gosling is the only one getting any attention.",2023-07-23

"Saw this last night and was shocked at how good it was. Of all the directions they could have taken a fever dream Barbie movie, a PG-13 social commentary on feminism was a pretty bold move but they pulled it off incredibly well. Definitely movie of the summer.

"This film has been in the works since 2009 and given its time in the works and the brilliant marketing of this movie's release I couldn't believe how unfinished and underdeveloped the screenplay felt. It felt more like a film centred on a draft rather than a final version. There were some scenes and jokes that were brilliant however the screenwriters insisted on taking on too many complex themes at once, leaving them unsatisfactority explored and left the plot feeling jumbled in trying to keep up with them at times.

The exploration and conclusion of the existentialism theme felt criminally base-level given how hyped this element of the story was. I could perhaps have been more satisifed with the conclusion of this theme had the philosophical assertions been explored to a greater degree, but if anything I felt sad for Barbie that she felt forced to leave behind an eternity of joyous contentment for an ephemeral life emburdened with struggle. It's a complicated subject to tackle & I feel screenwriters set themselves up for a near impossible task taking on existentialism as one of the main themes while also heavily leaning into other complex themes like gender struggle and consumerism, all while remaining playful and lighthearted. This theme didn‚Äôt even necessarily need a conclusion, acknowledgement throughout the screenplay of it‚Äôs impact on humans would have worked better for me than the attempt to consolidate the harsh realities of human existence. The film just isn‚Äôt ‚Äòdeep‚Äô enough to tackle that and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs Barbie, I don‚Äôt expect to leave with any philosophical awakening. Simply relating and feeling affirmed in my human emotion would have been enough.

Probably the most fleshed-out theme in the whole story was gender struggle. Barbie felt like the perfect opportunity to explore this theme in a campy and fun and clever way and they achieved this excellently throughout the plot, however the writers were evidently not confident in the audience's critical thinking capabilities when it comes to extracting and discussing this messaging from the screenplay without any spoon-fed lecturing. I'm a feminist and resonate with much of the struggles portrayed but I couldn't help but feel the movie took itself a bit too seriously in delivery at times when it would have been far more effective to simply playfully explore this power-struggle. I can't help but feel they ruined it by spoonfeeding what was already clearly substantiated by the screenplay alone. 

Gloria and Sasha's relationship were grossly underdeveloped. Sasha was completely unlikeable and seemed to treat her mother and everyone around her like garbage for no explicable reason. Had we had some insight on her own struggle with mental health, teenage angst and struggle navigating the appropriate level of assertiveness for each social situation, this could have helped, however her backstory is glossed over entirely. Gloria was more likeable and we get more insight into her struggles than Sasha's, however she also fell a bit flat for me. She struggles with complex feelings that the film simply did not have the time to explore and for me the overall lack of emotional intimacy with her as a character made it difficult to feel invested in her arc.

Mattel and their place in the story also felt like a glaring afterthought for screenwriters. Aside from acting as a gateway for Gloria and Barbie's eventual 'reunion' and maybe a few comedic jabs at patriarchy and capitalism they served very little to the plot and wasted critical time.

Even Barbieland, controversially it seems, felt quite underdeveloped as a concept. The map was tiny and yet it is implied that every Barbieland barbie has a real-world owner. Are the majority of owned Barbies simply not represented in Barbieland? Perhaps I‚Äôm being a bit pedantic here‚Ä¶I did really enjoy the the set design and costumes however, also found the casting was brilliant. I enjoyed Ken‚Äôs incel arc and his misguided hyper-fixation on horses and overall the film was enjoyable, but not as iconic and timeless as I had hoped it would be.

*Edited punctuation and grammar*",2023-07-24
"Thoroughly enjoyed the first act, but as the film went on it got worse and worse for my tastes.

The premise is wonderful: that this idea of a utopian Barbieland of plastic feminism is actually dystopian. So to actually empower women you need to go to the real world and learn to deal with the fear of change in life, depression, mother-daughter relationships, fear of ageing, etc. It's classical Bildungsroman with a very contemporary injection of perspectives. All of that was really good and shows how you can be whimsical but still tackle mature themes.

But then the film nosedives into disappointment. The mother and daughter relationship arc just gets abandoned without proper development. The Barbies' tactic of fixing Barbieland is by having them act out the worst type of stereotypically female emotional manipulation on the Kens. And the end-state of Barbieland is just a revert back to the plastic hyper-feminist dystopian dreamland where you wake up and do the same thing every day. The only characters that get ""liberated"" are Stereotypical Barbie and, very marginally, Gosling-Ken, who no longer has the singular identity of ""Beach"". (But he's still homeless! Have we not learnt anything after 2 hours of very blatant gender politics exploration?)

And then that whole Pinocchio ending just happens. The Barbie dreamhouse TV show is so much better than this disappointment.",2023-07-26
"I'm surprised so many people find the movie misandrist. In fact, it says a lot about how we are still so far from a fair society. It's only misandrist because it focuses in women and its role as part of a society WITHOUT any real love story behind them. I guess chick flicks are only acceptable if there's some male love interest they fall high heels for (pun intended).
If anything, I think it was more of an attack on how childhood magic is used to manipulate both girls and boys.

Anyway, I found the movie incredibly smart. Every single frame had some kind of thought or concept behind it. It was so layered, honestly one of the most ""brainy"" movies out there. To the point where it could be too much. I did not enjoy the ""packaging"" for those layers though, the action itself and the story was kind of boring.",2023-07-26
"This movie was a little too meta for me. It makes it hard to tell what the stakes are if you don't have any understanding of what's possible. I know I shouldn't take it that seriously but it is about serious topics. I also understand everyone's problem with the last act. The worst part is when the little girl goes ""What does Barbie get?"" as an extremely unnatural way to set up Barbie themestating to the audience. It reminds me of lines in poorly written musicals where you set up a song by asking a character how he feels. 

Ryan Gosling looks old for this. He's only 42 but he does stand out among a crowd of guys in their early 30s. It felt to me like his story was a woman's view of what masculinity is. Beer and muscle cars I get, but horses? Are horses supposed to be a man thing? They can be, but they can just as easily be for girls. 

What even is a boyfriend in Barbieland? Ken doesn't get to sleep over and Barbie never kisses him. How is his relationship with her any different from her relationship to the other Kens? 

Closer to Fine vs Push. I like Push a lot, but this movie sure doesn't. This movie would have been worth seeing just to watch Ryan Gosling do his Rob Thomas impression. Does anybody ""Anyway here's Wonderwall"" Push? Is that a thing? I guess it's easy enough to play. They sang Closer to Fine like four times in this movie and nobody *ever* tried to do the low split. That was very unsatisfying. 

I liked how the opening Lizzo song changed lyrics when Barbie started going wrong. Otherwise the original music does not do anything for me. Especially the Ken one.  

One direction they could have taken this, that they shouldn't have but it's funny to think about, is the Barbies realizing that their jobs are fake. Doctor Barbie doesn't actually heal Ken or have any medical knowledge, she's just a doctor to show girls in real world they can become a doctor. They live in a world where nobody actually needs to do work. Another thought I had that I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking is that nobody acted concerned that a strange pink cowboy woman was walking into a middle school and acting way too friendly with a random student. I feel like the reaction would be less ""Barbie is sexist"" and more ""this woman is a creep."" 

My favorite jokes:

* All the physical comedy in the first part with Barbie drinking from empty cups, the fridge being a sticker, the pools being solid, etc.

* Ken being exposed to masculinity by going up an escalator in Century City and seeing a giant screen display of Bill Clinton

* The two times in the movie they mention genitalia

* ""Nobody whose feet are shaped this way should wear these""

* ""I have a Jewish friend""",2023-07-29
"Barbie‚Äôs trailer and all the promotions were pointing in directions of it bra comedy and a goofy movie with barbie and Ken struggling to adapt with the human ways and find there way home.


But in reality everything was rushed and no character had any development and even the plot had mo plot. It was kinda of a message.

The idea behind the movie (what I took) was that no single authority is good for the society and ppl coz if only one type of ppl govern the ppl that have been left out don‚Äôt feel a part of their own land.

Will Ferrell and Ryan gosling were the only funny bit in the movie

The movie didn‚Äôt need to say women men every 10 seconds coz it was getting annoying. 

I really was excited to to see Greta, being a fan of her work and being one of my favourite directors whose movie I would watch no questions asked. Was kinda of a disappointment

I would say it was  a 6/10,with Margot being 10/10 and Ryan being 10/10 and the plot being 3/10",2023-08-10
"I can see the real world bits being a drag for some people but I love that Ken spent 5 minutes in it and decided the patriarchy was cool. That's fucking hilarious to me. And totally makes sense with how sad Ken is. But it's delivered with the perfect amount of wimpiness but a kind of vulnerability. Or maybe I just love Ryan Gosling that's a strong possibility.

And I think Robbie did manage to nail what was needed from Barbie in a movie where she kind of has to react to the weirder world around her while also explaining her naive worldview. She also nailed the silly bits of literally rolling on the ground too. 

And I do love that Skipper escaped before, the execs know about Barbieland and know that the ghost of Ruth lives on the 14th floor. There's some weird Toy Story X Men In Black movie I kind of want to see there. 

I would love a Mojo Dojo Casa House for Christmas. Or that Ken hoodie. I'm not picky.",2023-07-21
"Gonna preface this by saying I think Ladybird is an excellent film and Little Women is one of my favorite movies of all time (possibly top 5), so I was always planning on watching Barbie on premiere night before the crazy marketing or Oppenheimer memes even were a thing.

It fell a little... flat for me? I liked the movie overall but it's like a 7.5 for me. I think the overall message was great, the actors for the most part did a great job, with standouts obviously being Gosling and Robbie. Their imagination for the sets was outstanding, every one looked better than the other. Music was great. Greta Gerwig directed the FUCK out of every shot and I loved her dialogue as always. But it didn't have the ""it"" factor of Little Women for me.

America Ferreras speech was a nice moment but it doesn't even begin to come close to Jo's speech about being lonely, or Laurie's proposal, or Amy's speech about marriage being an economic proposition.

The Mattel subplot REALLY didn't need to be extended to Barbieland. The scenes with Ruth didn't really impact me except the ""Mothers stand still so their daughter can see how far they've come"" line.

Again, by no means I'm saying it was a bad movie. It was a very good movie that just fell short of being a great one by not quite striking the balance between pop culture silliness and genuine sentimentality.",2023-07-21

"Ryan Gosling does a really good Rob Thomas impression when he's singing that Matchbox 20 song, it's criminal that his version doesn't seem to be on the soundtrack.

Also I don't really know how I feel about the resolution to the movie basically being to make the Kens back into second class citizens (they're basically all canonically homeless), like I thought they'd go for a more ""wow it's shitty to have to be like that"" type of thing.

It did a very challenging thing: combining genuinely funny, surreal, and existential moments with having a message about empowerment and identity, while also pushing a corporate mythology about a much beloved toy. I could have done with less of the last bit, but when you‚Äôre making a big budget movie with a licensed product, you‚Äôre beholden to the product‚Äôs masters and you have to give a little. I actually credit Mattel for allowing someone to take such a weird swing.

I had a question that I‚Äôd like some opinions on: When Ken sings the ‚Äú[I‚Äôm just Ken](https://youtu.be/wwux9KiBMjE)‚Äù song, are we to take it as an expression of someone having self-worth but they feel crushed by a system that keeps them as an appendage the Barbies? ‚Äî like if the situation was in the real world, this would be a woman singing a song about how she is trapped by the patriarchy and feels like she has so much more to offer the world than superficial things. 

*OR* was the song a statement of male power in support of continuing the patriarchal system that Ken imported from the real world? In the moment, is Ken asking to be appreciated for who he is, or is he boastful and egotistical. 

I know that‚Äôs crazy to fixate on but I couldn‚Äôt get the question out of my head after seeing the movie last night.",2023-07-25

Didn't really feel like Barbie herself had a strong character arc, her decision in the end didn't really feel like a satisfying resolution.

Barbie returns to keep the status quo, Ken returns to change it. Barbie then has a emotional meltdown and other women/barbies have to take over in the final act of the movie. Ken even gets the big fight/musical number scene. The only moment in the movie Barbie shows any agency over her own destiny is when she chooses not to go back into the box and runs away from Mattel, but that doesn't change the course of the movie either because she still ends up back in barbieland all the same. idk, I was ready for the biggest girl power movie in 2023 but this felt so unsatisfying.",2023-07-22

"Saw with my blonde barbie girlfriend after watching Oppenheimer, was really fun. I don't think it's a film that requires a lot of analysis or a lot of viewings to understand everything, it was very forward with its point and delivered it really well with comedy.

People don't like how the kens were portrayed, but half the point at least is that women are presented as 1 dimensional clueless hot things for like...all of western civilization, so it kind of blows my mind we can't let them have a couple of movies where they do that to men.There's lots of feminists media I've seen where I agree with the point but they do it so badly and in such an unfunny way that I immediately cringe. 

Unfortunately that's been most feminist media for me.Barbie hit different though, because it didn't try to hide, and when it did spill it out in your face, it wasn't deceptive about it at all, and because of the tone of the movie, it worked. Plus it was just...funny.The end of the movie with the older lady was a lil too preachy for me but heck it did fit and I'm sure a lot of people liked how it made them feel.",2023-07-25

The jokes in addition were well written and the scenes were not just filled with stupid jokes like how we saw in Thor L&T.  Was great to see a movie with jokes and fun considering how all the recent movies were all action and stuff. 

The cast was perfect. Margot Robbie as barbie was a incredible choice (that 4th wall break about her was well done and smart), Ryan Gosling as Ken was just....perfect. He and Simu Lui killed their role.  Micheal Cera as Allan was great. He wasnt used too much, or too less but the perfect amount. 

The plot was well a bit thin but was well executed with good pacing, however the ending scene between barbie and the founder could be cut by a min or two. In contrast the ""Ken War"" has to be one of the best comedic musical scenes hollywood has come out with. That was just incredible to watch in the big screen. The set was just beautiful.  

Well done and executed on all levels, good pacing and great jokes. Good movie however I can see some people finding it bland or not good.

"It was alright but nothing special. The message was ok, but also pretty basic. Judging by other online reviews, the people who need to hear the message the most are the same ones who are going to see the movie and miss the point anyway lol. The bright colors were a nice hit of dopamine at least",2023-08-11
"While the plot flounders a bit, and I agree that the Will Ferrell/CEO thing was superfluous and didn't really add anything, I think rather than criticize I would like to credit Gerwig for accomplishing more as a director for the ""feminist"" movement with this one movie than has been accomplished in 30 years.

In summary,  what Barbie successfully does, in my opinion, through the great power of social satire, is illuminate the fact that men are not even capable of the great subterfuge historically attributed to them.  The movie holds a lens up to that fact that, in seeking the enemy, it is perhaps not men, but women themselves who give continue to give away their power by playing into objectification.   

Robbie and Gosling play their roles with just the right balance of humor and cultural awareness.  Have always loved Gosling, who has the courage to laugh at himself and all ""Kens"" and steals the show.  Rather than laugh and talk about how funny it was, and how on point, which it absolutely was, I hope it reminds women to choose not to conform or be objectified every day.  The indicator of great art is that it stimulates discussion.",2023-08-16
"Finally watched last night. Slept on it, read some reviews and now, I've come to the conclusion that this movie was just a money grab. A giant advertisement which skewed decisions being made with it's creation. They had an ending in their mind and worked backwards to make that ending possible. 

The real world is just as ridiculous as the barbie world and must be set in some other world besides earth. Maybe it's supposed to be created how a child sees the world at a young age? Possibly, but Will Ferrell needing a key card for the gate just lost me. Worst way possible to fill a plot hole. 

Overall, if you put real world realities aside, and see that this barbie movie is strictly between barbie and ""Gloria"", America Ferreras character, it doesn't have to be a perfect fit for your own perceptions. Gloria has a dark side which comes out with her drawings of barbie. Watching the movie through her characters eyes does make this experience a bit more enjoyable. 

Sure there are feminist and sexist tones throughout, but they were so ridiculous that it couldn't be what the movie was really trying to say. It's a story based on a doll created for women and they had to play the part. Anything else just wouldn't be true to the doll. 

If you see this for what it is, which I mentioned before, as a giant advertisement, you will enjoy the movie way more than if you try to compare it to your own life and perceptions",2023-11-19
"Loved this movie and didn't expect to laugh that much. Really appreciated the music, singing and dance numbers, and sets. Also what's the actual line, something like ""long distance low maintenance casual girlfriend?"" I died",2023-07-21
"Very funny and very thought-provoking at the same time. Lots of visual jokes - I think one needs to watch the movie a second time to get them all. I probably issed half of the references to horses.

The main characters all have their own story arc. Even the minor characters were lovingly drawn, and I got the impression that a lot of joy and love went into making this movie.

Not everything ends well but there is hope. Sometimes perfection does not exist, not even in Barbieworld. 

I loved the scene in the kitchen >!where Barbie meets her creator for the first time without knowing it.!<

I'd love to give it a 10/10, but I don't think I can rank it more than an 8/10. They could've really elevated the movie by cutting the whole Will Ferrell subplot, which doesn't really have a big impact on the plot, and replacing it with a deeper exploration of the main theme of gender equality. The movie didn't fall into the old trap of ""making progressive statements about a topic while failing to actually integrate the topic into the plot in a coherent and significant way"", but >!I did feel it was a little lazy to have the patriarchy just kinda happen and then be resolved mainly through voting and a rousing speech, especially considering how important the issue of gender quality was to the main plot.!<",2023-07-25
"Actually, it isn‚Äôt the case that before Barbie little girls played only with baby dolls.  The Vogue doll company sold a family of small dolls including the famous Ginny doll (she was about 7 years old); Ginny‚Äôs baby sister, Ginette; Ginny‚Äôs older sister, Jill (a teenager); Jill‚Äôs best friend, Jan; and Jill‚Äôs brother, Jeff.  Jill, Jan, and Jeff had adult bodies, although, of course, they lacked genitals.  Jill and Jeff were billed as brother and sister (hence, not dating), and it was sometimes hinted that Jan was Jeff‚Äôs girlfriend (his prom date).  

The Vogue dolls, and, in particular, the Ginny doll, had beautiful outfits made with attention to detail.  

There was also a beautiful miniature adult doll manufactured by the Ideal company called the Revlon doll.  She also came with a brassiere and panty girdle, and she also had nylon hose.  She was essentially a fashion doll, having the look of a well-dressed young woman of the 1950s.  Many of the garments made for her were beautifully sewn.  I think also that the Revlon doll may have also come in a larger version.  The miniature doll may have been a prototype for the larger doll.  

My aunt gave me a Revlon doll when I was about eight years old.  My friend had a Jill doll and, I think, a Jeff doll, too.  There was no such doll as the Barbie doll at that time.  I think that Barbie was first developed in 1959.  

Most dolls at that time were larger than the Barbie doll; for example, a baby doll could be the size of a real baby.  I think that small dolls like the Vogue dolls, the Ideal dolls, and the Mattel dolls were relatively new on the market.",2023-09-16
"as a woman, the barbie movie really didn't do it for me. it screams of an overly simplified and whitewashed, rainbows and butterflies portrait of feminism that's a far cry from reality. in the real world, racism and poverty are deeply intertwined with the struggle for gender equality. the movie paints the picture that if women just stick together, stay strong, and have big dreams, we can defeat the patriarchy!!! but haven't women been doing that already this whole time? the fight against sexism looks vastly different for a disabled, poor, queer woman of color vs a financially privileged, able bodied white woman. the movie has plenty of diversity, but paints their struggles as all the same, using them as little more than token minorities. it's quite patronizing, but a lot of people will never be ready for that conversation. it was cute and all, and i'm always for female empowerment, but it is not the feminist masterpiece people are praising it to be. for such a ~woke~ movie, it really wasn't very woke at all.",2024-01-24

"Ow, my head hurts from being hit over the head so strongly by the message",2023-07-21
"I was rather disappointed. I had higher expectations. It did not live up to its potential with that cast. It wasn't nearly funny enough. Ryan Gosling overshadowed Margot Robbie, who to be honest was the only reason I went to see it. 

I think it went in and out of the double entendres and side humor too frequently. It couldn't decide what it wanted to be. I had hoped that it would be more like the '90's Brady Bunch movie, which was near perfection. It needed to be both lighter and darker.

I think the feminist awakening and the male backlash were both a little too heavy. I think it was a worthy issue and perspective to take head on, but if they had kept it lighter, the potential for humor would have been much greater.

In one other area, I'd like to compare it with the Ghostbusters reboot, which was a much better movie than its detractors maligned it as. The female perspective was fine; the problem was they were completely outclassed by Chris Hemsworth, who owned every scene he was in. Similarly, Ryan completely outshone Margot in this one, and it became the Ken Movie. Margot needed to be let loose. She need to bring a bit of Harley and a bit of evil into the role.

Those are my main thoughts; sorry my writing and expression aren't better as I have difficult writing on mobile. I'd give it 2 stars out of 4.",2023-07-21

Meanwhile in the real world there are hordes of fragile and triggered men who are seething uncontrollably about the Barbie movie and cannot let it go. They ironically are becoming the very Kens that the movie was making fun of.",2023-07-22
"A good, humorous film weighed down by it's excessive social commentary. I knew it would tackle issues like feminism, beauty standards and the patriarchy, but I didn't realise how overbearing it would be. At times, it almost felt condescending. Don't take me wrong, those issues should have been highlighted, but a part of me wished we spent a little bit more time with Barbie, Ken and their wacky adventures in the real world before moving onto that. I still enjoyed it overall, just wished there had been a bit more balancing between the two tones.

As I predicted going into, Gosling was the best part of the film. They couldn't have casted a better actor for the role.",2023-07-22
Not only was the movie extremely fun but it seemed to trigger all the right people. An absolute win in my eyes.,2023-07-23
"It was a decent movie. The jokes were hard-hitting and the movie itself was 'pleasing to the eyes' but the message was a bit confusing. I understand that the overarching message was something like 'be who you want to be' but you cannot ignore the obvious - yes, it's mean to men. 

I think one can make an argument that the treatment of kens is equivalent to women in real world but then, why didn't it talk about matriarchy in the same light as patriarchy? In the real world, there is a sense of what equal rights and opportunities are about. In Barbieland, kens lived in ignorance of their own rights. Throughout the movie, kens were the butt of the joke and portrayed as just dumb.

Overall, it was a movie I enjoyed but the flaws are obvious. 6/10.",2023-07-23
"It didn‚Äôt live up to the hype for me. I love Little Women and Lady Bird so much and had high expectations. Every time the script and plot leaned into the humanness of it all, I loved it. But then it would pull away and become silly again. There should have been more about the mother/daughter and less about Barbieland. Why were Sasha and her mom trying to save Barbie? Barbie is a toy and is fictional. Barbie should have been working to help the Real World. Barbie should have been a vessel to explore mother/daughter relationships, and the patriarchy/gender roles in the Real World. Some of the movie was really funny but a lot of the humor was very meta. It felt like you had to be in on the joke in order to get the joke. I was so happy when I picked up on America ferrera‚Äôs husband saying ‚ÄúSi se puede!!‚Äù Millennials and anyone that grew up with disney channel would get it. Some humor went over my head. Ryan Gosling/Ken was the star of the show, but is the takeaway of a movie about Barbie supposed to be Ken? I did pick up on a lot of messages about men‚Äôs mental health which was thought provoking and unique. I felt like the message was beat over my head and yet I still don‚Äôt understand the message‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Maybe it means it‚Äôs a good movie since I‚Äôm still thinking about it‚Ä¶.",2023-07-23
"I gotta say I was disappointed. Here is why:

1. Way too direct. They directly state the feminism stuff instead of showing it. Come on guys use some subtlety. Mattel wanted it to be blatantly stated I imagine for marketing appearance.

2. I venture to say that the barbies on the shelves are far less diverse than the cast. Most Barbies are white. I think mattel wanted their product to seem like they value diversity more than they do. 

3. The casting of a plus size actress bothered me when in fact, barbie does not have a doll that mirrors her body size. I think it should, but Mattel does not make that. They have 'curvy barbie' which, if translated to the real world, probably would have a bmi well within the healthy range, but is still like ideal placements for body mass. Like it's all in the hips, butt, boobs. She's got no belly and no love handles. Again, I think mattel wanted to make it seem like their product reflects plus size body types when they actually never made a doll for that. 

4. When I played with Barbies I remember we would make them fuck each other and harm each other. I guess they kinda alluded to that with weird barbie. But I would've liked to see that more. I think most little girls are not just having them participate in their careers and whatnot. Little girls are acting out their messed up inner thoughts with those toys for sexual exploration and violent urges. 

5. The Corporate execs were just kinda there. Again, Mattel didn't want it to go too far with the corporate dark side. 

6. The whole issue with dolls and little girls playing with dolls and how that relates to the patriarchy is that the little girls are not stimulating those complex parts of their brains. So even if you play with engineer barbie, you're still just playing dolls. You're not actively thinking through spatial patterns or building things with your hands that will later help you advance in science and math fields. This was not addressed. Mattel, give the kids like a puzzle to solve or something to build with their hands while they play with barbie. And then pay me for the idea.",2023-07-24

"I'm not sure why some men are all up in arms. Not every story has to be relatable in my opinion? I'm a guy and although the Kens ultimately didn't ""win"", I found the movie to be incredibly charming, meaningful, and worthwhile. I understand why people say the message was muddled, but to me, that represents the female experience perfectly, and I thought Robbie/Ferrera explained that pretty well. Was it a 10/10? No, but I was smiling ear to ear I think the entire time.",2023-07-22
" I'm kind of surprised at the amount of people who enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch! The acting, costumes, set and music were all incredible. The story on the other hand, made no flippin sense. I was REALLY disappointed when the movie turned into a ""boys vs girls"". I didn't understand why the writers chose to pivot away from the original plot of ""finding the girl who is sad and helping her"" to making Ken the villain. 

Where it started to fall apart for me was when Barbie finds Sasha in the real world. Sasha makes a valid point that stereotypical barbie is an unrealistic example of a woman and puts too much pressure on little girls. But the thing is that Barbieland is FILLED WITH non-stereotypical barbies! And none of the criticisms that Sasha mentions are really addressed in the film. The film just pivots to barbies vs Kens and forgets the mother-daughter relationship it was trying to repair. Not to mention the ending made NO SENSE!

I think the movie would have been better if the focus was on that original problem: that barbies don't look like every little girl or boy. The film would have been better if at the start of the film, every barbie was a stereotypical barbie. And after barbie visits the real world, experiences the sexism and misogyny and sees the undue pressures her image is causing if she somehow helped Sasha accept herself or took her back to barbieland to help her change the stereotypical barbies into unique barbies. The same plot of Mattel trying to stop barbie could have been left in, and in the end Mattel could have seen that unique barbies/kens were selling better than stereotypical ones, thus advertising Mattel's actual changes to the barbie brand.

But that's just me.",2023-07-26

"Without the ability to be truly critical of Barbie, this movie does not rise above an ad and the corporate goals made it a bloated mess.

In the real world Mattel bought a German ""call-girl doll"" named Lilli, made for pervy adult men, and re-branded it Barbie. To cover for a very long controversial history this very Mattel funded movie made cartoonish silly billy execs (weirder than Barbie) to take the fall. It's a very clumsy and pointless (other than PR) addition. - Will Farrel needs to catch Barbie, why?

Without this ad agenda (complete with 'make sure it ends on a pro Mattel message'), this could have been a great exploration of gender roles, etc. (and not require a pile of extra characters and ghost saviors).

It's better than the usual brand-first movies (a bit weird there are Barbie actresses with body types they don't actually sell), but disappointing that it is very much in that genre.",2023-07-21

"Excerpts from my Letterboxd review:

In journeying to the real world, Barbie not only wrestles with objectification but learns to stop seeing herself through others' eyes as the object, finally standing on her own two (flat) feet.

Elsewhere, the concept of Ken as a stand-in for all the insecure men who treat women as mere extensions of their ego ‚Äî well, it's sublime. Indeed, this dress-up, toybox world is perfect for skewering the performative antics of self-styled ""alpha males"".

As absurd and cerebral as the film gets, Gerwig finds a wellspring of emotion in the nostalgia of childhood, specifically the idea of Barbie as the idealised adulthood children think they will grow into. The conflict between the pristine utopia of Barbie and the painful, this-is-water realities of adulthood forms the film's beating heart ‚Äî Margot Robbie captures the conflict with soul and gentle grace, at times calling to mind her angelic version of Sharon Tate.",2023-07-22
"Pretty good and thoroughly enjoyable, but not great IMO. Very funny in places, Ryan Gosling especially was delightful. I thought the conclusion that the world needs a Barbie doll that addresses the issues women face in the real world, such as cellulite and juggling careers with their family life was bizarre, considering the purpose of a doll is essentially for children to have imaginative, escapist fun, which was incidentally the most successful aspect of the film. I don‚Äôt have children, but I can‚Äôt imagine that the concept of playing with a doll that is divorced, has two children, an office job, bills to pay and PCOS would be particularly entertaining for them. Overall, I had fun, but I greatly prefer Little Women.",2023-07-22

"Overall I really enjoyed this movie-- the Barbie nostalgia, amazing sets and costumes, and the surprising amount of sometimes very harsh self aware humor were great. I felt the goal of empowering women and acknowledging where society is failing them was well communicated.

America Ferreira's speech is awesome: an affecting summary of the contradictory roles women that society expects them to perform-- all while Barbie, a physical representation of that oppression, is breaking down from it as well as the thought that she was built off of it. But, as the characters mention afterwards, by putting these struggles into words, we now have an understanding of how insane these expectations are, and that we can choose to be free from it.

I think where this movie starts to fail is when it comes to Ken and men in general. His story and arc were really messy IMO, and it sucks because the movie started to touch on some really interesting ideas here that I wish they had expanded on:

1) I don't think they communicated that Ken was an incel for Barbie til later in the movie (I interpreted the ""every night is girls' night"" as the dolls' general obliviousness to sex). Even near the end though, I didn't feel like Barbie and Ken's reconciliation felt right. Barbie apologizes to Ken for taking him for granted, but she has nothing to apologize for-- she makes it clear that they're not together or that she's into him, and she should have the right to spend her time the way she likes.

The whole scene is actually really counterproductive, because women often acquiesce to men IRL because they feel bad for letting down a guy who likes them. I wish that scene had gone more along the lines of Barbie drawing a clear boundary in their relationship and defending her choices, while at the same time encouraging him to move on, gain confidence in himself, and learn more about himself as a person.

(edit: I read some more thoughts on this apology, and that it's more about how men feel lost or marginalized in a feminist world. I agree that sometimes feminism sidelines men and that that sucks, and I wish this had come across more clearly in that apology scene.)

2) The way conflicts were solved was also very toxic. The Barbies literally emotionally manipulate the Kens into fighting one another to foil the election. Not that any incels are gonna see the Barbie movie, but this is like pure incel fuel-- they hate women and think of them as tricksters, and it's also shitty to represent the Kens as bumbling war-obsessed jealous idiots.

This is such a huge failure IMO because it provides yet another poor example of how to healthily talk about problems between the sexes. I would have preferred that the Barbies (after all getting deprogrammed) successfully win over the patriarchy Kens' respect, and that they rebuild Barbieland together.

The icing on this shitty cake is when the Barbies humorously tell the Kens they can't be in the Supreme Court, and will have to start at the lower courts. WTF? This excuse-- oh sure, we can be equal, but you need to start on the bottom rung-- is used on women IRL and it fucking blows. (And no, I'm not advocating that women be insta-promoted or hired without the relevant knowledge/experience for a job, but pointing out that women to this day still do not hold many positions of power, and are relegated to lower positions)

3) Mattel pokes fun at itself in some surprisingly subversive ways, but by the end of the movie never actually answers for some its more heinous crimes. It's a funny scene when Will Ferrel bumbles over how there are no women on the Director's Board, yet we see no resolution to this issue. When America Ferreira suggests the idea of a regular Barbie to help with womens' self esteem issues, it's written off as not being lucrative. 

The translation of Barbie and Kens to women and men also doesn't quite work, because Ken IS an accessory to Barbie because that's just what the toy is... so unless Mattel is intending to make Ken dolls just as prolific as Barbies, the message doesn't really land right.

Overall, I think it's a good movie, but the discussion around gender roles is still extremely complicated, and for how self deprecating it gets at times, I wish it could have provided a more honest and healthy example for how to deal with these complexities in the real world.",2023-07-23
"The movie was amazing. Witty, meta, perfect timing and the most fun I remember having on a movie theater in a long, long time. 
On a side note, I know more than one fully grown adult who didn't understand the movie.

"As a filmmaker and a queer pastel princess, I was so so so excited for this film. Campy movies with bright colors, outlandish designs, and dark humor are always my favorite. I was ready for the darkly funny Stepford Wife/Pleasantville vibes that the trailer gave and went in full pink regalia with my friends. 

  
**Pros:** It was really funny in a campy way, had an important message, and the set + costume design was amazing. I want every single outfit and every piece of furniture in my home. Ken being an insecure incel had me rolling the entire time. America Ferrera's speech also destroyed my heart. There were also a lot of really beautiful moments like Barbie soaking in her surroundings that I wanted to see more of. 

   
**Cons:** It felt like everything was just rushed through, which made the message and the character arcs feel really surface-level. I wish they took more time to build up to Barbie's realization. For ex: Instead of things changing basically overnight, having weird things build up little by little to a point where she can't ignore it anymore. I  also 100% agree with the feminist message, but I wish it was executed in a way that wasn't so spelled out. I think showing the contrast between Barbieland and America Ferrera's experiences in the real world would've been more impactful. Or if they showed more of Barbie struggling to navigate the real world while Ken slowly discovered more about the patriarchy. IMO, it would've been better as a two-part movie. I feel like only Ken got a real character arc and the room to shine as a character.

While I did think the script was funny, I also don't think the writers knew the type of humor they were going for. It seemed like they wanted to do a satire/dark comedy, but didn't know how to approach serious topics like gender inequality and womens struggles without being on-the-nose. Tbh I wish it was written the way Addams Family Values was. It was able to blend dark humor, campiness, and bitingly smart commentary about class and conservatism so well that you didn't even realize it until after.

In conclusion, is it the witty, deep satire that I thought it'd be? No. But I did have fun and will watch again next weekend in a ridiculous pink, fluffy tulle gown. This is my review that nobody asked for :')

completely unrelated side note but holy shit Hari Nef looks like an entirely new person with red hair. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was her until I looked up the cast haha",2023-07-24
"As a an adult male, I thought this movie was great. It poked fun at gender roles and gender in society as extremes in both genders and the overall theme was a place in society as equals and not some extremism feminist movement men bad thing.  Humor was amazing and clever and the adult jokes were awesome , reminded me of Shrek. The beach off scene in particular. 

I would have liked to see more real world interactions and I‚Äôm not sure why they made Will Ferral character mentally challenged. But overall it was great. 9/10

I also think people are taking this movie way to seriously and framing it as some gospel for feminism and young women etc. This film was a satire about gender roles in society and have could easily been an SNL skit that was rated R. Stop trying to over analyze and politicize everything and just laugh and enjoy it.",2023-07-24
"I loved this movie and loved the way it made certain points.

The movie has one clearly obvious scene and one or two other nods to the matrix depending how deep you look in to it. (Ruth as the oracle, mattel execs being agents)

I think referencing the matrix helps drive the direction of the points they were trying to make about society being blind to systematic oppression. Just like Neo was originally blind to the matrix (even though it felt off). He had to choose to see it and took the red pill. Much the same as barbie had to choose to see the real world and how it functions with men dominating most positions of power. Thats what barbie was blind to. Not the existence of two worlds but that the flip side of the coin in the real world made her have uncomfortable feelings and that is how Ken feels in Barbieland. 

Furthermore, after Barbies retake power they dont bring things back to normal, they give Kens some positions of power and Barbie says to Ken that not every night is girls night. This shows that Barbie has learned from her experience and empathizes with Kens position in Barbieland.

There are other themes that are important to note as well but **systematic oppression taking away a person‚Äôs agency** is the big one. The ending and the specific language used by Ruth and Barbie solidify that for me. They talk about what being a human is, not necessarily a woman and what it is that all humans want (to create and feel that we have made a meaningful impact on the world).

I think Barbie having an existential crisis isnt really a theme but more of a symptom of the mothers life. living in a world built for and by men and the real existential crises in real people that exist in a world not made for or by them. And it makes sense why people would feel that way. 

Before watching the movie I attributed higher rates of anxiety and depression in women to just the way women work. now im considering that maybe its a symptom of a bigger problem and not ‚Äòjust the way women are‚Äô. (Theres tons of research on this but i pulled a semi recent meta analysis to bolster my point here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892592/)

Its sad that we can be blind to these things but its important to constantly try to make it better. 

Full disclosure Im married, hetero, white, cis, atheistic, college educated, and male. I have typical male gendered interests. I understand why Barbie would make men feel uncomfortable. But the point is that the problem is still ongoing and it is not in the past and you can‚Äôt just bury your head in the sand and ignore problems just because they make you feel bad.",2023-07-24
"It was decent, I kinda wish Ken(s) got a more satisfying resolution. 

And before you say ‚Äú it‚Äôs a Barbie movie, it‚Äôs about Barbie‚Äù I ask that you watch Wreck-it Ralph. A movie about old games, obviously geared towards a male audience and older, and it has a great resolution for the female side character Vanellope. She was a great character with problems, and her story was about feminism and how she didn‚Äôt fit the stereotype of cute girls into girl stuff. Her story didn‚Äôt take anything away from how good the whole movie was. This could have been Ken.

Movie was fairly funny, great acting and costumes/settings, and some interesting ideas but just didn‚Äôt end in a satisfying way and it was a little preachy. A 9/10 or 10/10 film to me is Everything, Everywhere All At Once and I wouldn‚Äôt say Barbie is anywhere close to that.",2023-07-26
"am i the only one slightly disappointed with how they wrote out the ending for the Kens?

to preface, i absolutely support the importance of having an identity outside of your partner and i don't think this message was bad at all. i just wish that rather than have barbie being the one to tell ken that he's enough without her, they had the two ken groups come together and engage in meaningful discussion about how they're feeling. this would've shown the importance of platonic male friendship and male support (something that is lacking in our current society or often made fun of when men talk about their feelings with each other and we all know the effects of toxic masculinity).

i feel like they had such a huge opportunity to teach a valuable lesson in what it means to be a man and how to approach/handle male communication in a healthy way. What they did was bring barbie into the picture and depicted her as overshadowing ken, made it her responsibility to tell ken that he's enough. it took away from a really good opportunity to depict that it is okay for men to talk about their feelings with each other, and support each other emotionally without getting bullied or made fun of. i'm thinking of the scene where barbie tells ken that it's okay to cry - i so wish that another ken had told him this, i think it would've made the scene so much more impactful if we saw men reassuring each other that it's okay to feel emotions and guide each other through that process.

i wish this was the focus for the kens at the end (and they totally could've done this in a light, easy to watch way following the style of the movie), men supporting each other and communicating with each other without shame, rather than the message that they put out of ""i'm enough without barbie"" because i feel like this can so easily be misconstrued to ""i don't need barbie to be ken"", and boys/men these days can definitely use a lesson or two on how to treat women (and that's a whole other lengthy discussion).",2023-07-27
"I have absolutely no idea what was going on with the ending (once Barbie entered the blank white dimension) I felt it was basically jumping the shark in the sheer absurdity of its direction, and the CEO was such a poor sideplot that should have been cut down substantially if it was going to lead to nothing of substance at all. Loved everything else though, what a bizarre experience",2023-07-27
"I really liked it.  It seemed more like it was having fun with all the gender war stuff than pushing any kind of message to me.  Ken was really funny and the mom acknowledging unrelenting thoughts of death Barbie made me laugh out loud.

The slapstick stuff and nonstop gags wore on me a bit, but otherwise it was a pretty unique movie with some heart and solid humor.  Glad I went and saw it.

Seems like people are taking it way too seriously.",2023-07-28
"Im not sure why I cried the entire time. It was embarrassing. Was with two platonic friends a boy and a girl. It really moved me. I always was blown away by this director though, from Frances ha to little women. Even her husband or partner or whatever,  his movie Marriage Story made me sob the whole time too. He did squid and whale, which I watched as a much younger person, and it impacted me then too",2023-07-28
"It's unbelievable that Ken steals the show in the Barbie movie. He goes through a far more interesting character arc than Barbie. [Every time Ken wasn't on screen, I was literally waiting for Ken to be back on screen.](https://youtu.be/S-6F1O6RcYY?t=15)

I'm not gonna bother making sense of the plot or story or world building. I realized it was an absurdist, surreal comedy and just go along with it. My only complaint is that I wished the messaging was just a *little* more subtle. Less is more, you know?",2023-07-30
"I saw it today. It was fun and absurd, but it was also kind of sloppy and didn't really seem to have an actual point. For a movie that dealt with some pretty serious subjects in a very direct way, it didn't really have coherent commentary on the subjects.

Ken literally says that he did a patriarchy because he liked horses.

It was weird, but it was an enjoyable movie to watch.",2023-08-06
"I think the barbie movie‚Äôs view on feminism is fair

I would go as far as to say it‚Äôs a more mediated approach to the discussion.

In the barbie world, the roles are reversed in terms of men and women, by the end of the movies the barbie said that the kens going to have to slowly gain authority which eventually would equal the barbies.

While the movie ends with the barbies ‚Äòwinning‚Äô, it is not anyone‚Äôs victory, just a shift view, and we know from speech that they will eventually be equals.

Back on the real real world side the roles are flipped, so the statement becomes that women will have to slowly earn authority and autonomy until it eventually equals that of men. 

the state of power in barbie land in the beginning and the end stays the exact same, but everyone agrees that kens would have been worse off if the event of the movie didn‚Äôt happen. 

 the event in the movie sparked a discussion that ultimately lead to both the kens and the barbies understanding each other and in turn themselves more.

Isn‚Äôt that what we should have in this grand discussion? Empathy?",2023-08-07
"I felt the movie low key blames women for the patriarchy. The Barbies allowed the Ken‚Äôs to establish a patriarchy out of nowhere. When they wanted to end it, they worked together to end it. If patriarchy exists, it‚Äôs because women allow it and it‚Äôs their job to stop it if they don‚Äôt like it. 

None of the Barbie‚Äôs are mothers. No shit they have careers and interesting lives. Maybe, just maybe, a woman‚Äôs role in bringing children into the world and getting them on their feet sets her back a few steps and cumulatively over generations the patriarchy gains hold.",2023-12-28
"Just saw it. I thought the ending was really disappointing. They should have suggested that the kens and Barbies work together as equals moving forward but instead, they decided to be petty and keep them relegated as second class citizens like in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. Annoying as hell.",2023-07-21
"Gerwig hiring Emerald Fennell to just stand around at the side of the frame and be ignored was hilarious.

"The script did an amazing job subverting expectations at every corner, pretty much flipping the power dynamic between men and women like three times in the first act without making it feel forced.",2023-07-23
"So comments on here are confusing me a little.

I thought the Kens represented men in the real world that are waking up to realizing what patriarchy has done to them. And the reason they wouldn't allow men on the supreme court in Barbie Land was because the Kens didn't embrace patriarchal institutions, i.e. college degrees, mentioned a few times. And they started to reject patriarchy by the end of the Ken War, and then fully rejected it by the end of the movie. Barbie Land, run by the real world patriarchy and so it mirrors the real world in it's patriarchal institutions, isn't there yet and that's the reason the Kens can't be on the supreme court.

Some comments on this thread though are saying the Kens represented women in the real world. Which would then make the Barbies represent the men and the patriarchy? So, in the end, the patriarchy wins but it's starting to fail as the Kens (women) and Barbies (men) become more aware of themselves?

On this point, what role the Kens are playing, I thought I had it but now I'm not so sure...",2023-07-23

"Was the daughter character supposed to come off as obnoxious and needlessly edgy as her role?

"I watched barbie today and I have a lot of feelings about it and I'm unsure as to whether I even enjoyed it or not but that's a separate issue.

In regards to ken, is his lack of character development (to a degree) meant to be a reflection of women's portrayal in the media? With one dimensional relationship based identities being a prominent trope of female characters. I am right in thinking that? or was it simply just meant to be playing into the stupidity of patriarchy... if so is that not hypocritical, in the sense that a society run by  ""one dimensional women""  would not make a good society or is that the point. 

Also re: ken, the placement although very funny of 'I'm just ken' felt like it was in the wrong place? Should it not have happened after the initial refusal from barbie? As opposed to after the destruction of barbie land, like it doesn't make sense to me that singing a song about being enough after ruining the society the barbie's had made that was although not necessarily equal but functional to a degree to it's main patrons, the barbies (Ultimately a children's toy, a matriarchal society makes sense if it's aimed at women) anyway why do they arrive at self realisation post destruction, would it not made more sense to have that song before Kendom was brought to life? like ken realises he's enough and then takes charge? this understandably would throw out the whole time line of the movie in regards to the real world visit. Please any opinions or thoughts are welcome.

Like any great film with such a build up, something is just niggling at me, and I'm not saying I am disappointed at the end result of the film but it does leave me with more questions than answers and plot points that didn't seem to come to a conclusion.

On the plus side, the portrayals of women's trials and tribulates and America's monologue were phenomenal. The symbolism of barbies interaction with the old lady on the bench and just overall emotional journey I went on throughout the film was pure awe. I have not watched a film for a while that made me emotionally ache the way this one has. 

Perhaps that in itself is self explanatory and something that has only just click now, and it's silly for me to even mention this if it's abundantly obvious to everyone else. But i thought I'd ask incase I've missed the point completely. Any thoughts, feelings and opinions are welcome!",2023-07-30

"Saw the movie on Wednesday so I‚Äôm quickly forgetting details but I‚Äôll speak generally and say how much I love this movie. I had a general idea of the plot and I think I share that with other people that we knew Barbie goes to the real world and has an existential crisis/experience.  I think the trailer, cast, and general promo did an exceptional job at keeping the plot vague because I had no idea what was coming next. I saw one tweet from a random user about who could possibly be a villain but I didn‚Äôt pay it any mind because it seemed so off base, but it wasn‚Äôt! 

I laughed so much and enjoyed the emotional moments although I was very confused on where things were going. I let all the plot holes go and just sat back for the ride that was exploring the patriarchy, self worth, femininity, and horses. I‚Äôm hoping to see this movie again once the hype dies down a bit and I cannot wait for that day.",2023-07-22

"Overall, this was a lot of fun. Saw it at the drive-in with my wife for an extra dose of nostalgia. Plus, she‚Äôs 30 weeks pregnant, so we really enjoyed Midge (Pregnant Barbie)!

I realized about 90% through the runtime that the ‚ÄúReal World‚Äù plot didn‚Äôt really matter. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I expected, but I thought Barbie going to the Real World and fixing something was going to be the main plot line, but it sort of felt irrelevant by the end. The story was more about Barbie and Ken, in Barbieland/Kendom and figuring out who they were. Which was great. I could have done without the mother/daughter/Mattel employees and just had a deeper dive into Barbie and Ken. Going to the Real World was just a way to introduce the patriarchy to Ken, which they could have got to in other ways. 

Still really enjoyed the whole thing, though! McKinnon was great with Weird Barbie, and Cera as Allan. Depression Barbie was hilarious. Loved Ken discovering ‚Äúmasculinity,‚Äù the obsession with horses, ‚ÄúI am Kenough,‚Äù the beach off with accompanying dance number‚Ä¶Gosling was absolutely fantastic as Ken.

Physicist ken.


Also he literally had Jean Tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend. He loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things, people call him a dilletante, womanizer and insecure, neurotic.

There's even an early scene in the movie where he's pursuing Jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off.

"Really good film, it's rare for humour to land for me as much as Barbie did. 

The one thing I wasn't a massive fan of though (and maybe others would disagree) was that Ken only reflected on his ideology being wrong after he was defeated. It felt a bit weird that the film asked us to feel sympathy for Ken when a few minutes before he was cool with hypnotising the Barbies into basically being slaves (I suppose Ken is dumb enough to have not realised what he was doing but still), he basically only started reflecting on himself because he lost. It would have felt more genuine if he'd come to the realisation that what he was doing was wrong whilst still in control and then because of it he and the other Kens could have decided to vote against their own constitution change. On the other *hand doing that would probably mean writing out the Ken battle scene, and that was far too much fun to not include in the script.",2023-07-24

"Just saw this yesterday and loved it. It‚Äôs the best work I‚Äôve ever seen from Robbie and Gosling works overtime to justify his co-billing. In a way, this movie is what happens when you tell a lot of extremely talented and smart creatives to play with their Barbies and their dreamhouses again, and see what happens. If they‚Äôre really putting themselves and their experiences into that sort of playtime (and btw, anyone catch the Jacques Tati references?), you‚Äôre going to see a lifetime of pain and anger emerge. It‚Äôs just the way we humans roll.

It‚Äôs probably the one and only big-budget IP-oriented film that will ever even remotely resemble Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which used Barbie dolls to tell a story about sublimated misogyny that was so caustic, all copies of it were ordered destroyed by the courts. Barbie holds out hope here in moving past stereotypes and roles and embracing one‚Äôs humanity, frailty and mortality.

Had plenty of hilarious scenes, busted blokes' chops heaps, and the message behind it was surprisingly self-aware and poignant and worked within the medium, rather than pulling punches or completely demonising men to get the point across, it was done with tact. I thought it was pretty good and just the right amount of goofy. I can see why Ben Shapiro felt emasculated by it, Ken looked better in the black shirt pants combo. Margot killed it, Michael Cera was a favourite with myself and my friends who I went to see it with, it was great. Would see again.",2023-07-26

"I felt like it was kind of dogging on masculinity a little bit personally. I‚Äôm glad that those who enjoyed the film got to see a movie they enjoyed, but I personally didn‚Äôt feel too good about myself by the time I exited the theatre. Just my opinion here, not trying to start any arguments or offend anyone",2023-07-21
"Very funny.

But I did not like they shamed Ken for wanting love. They invalidated him and made him the villain.

Completely missed the mark on its own message",2023-07-21
"The irony isn‚Äôt lost on me that a movie about feminism was absolutely deadlifted by its male lead. Gosling/Ken was far and away the best part of this movie, and did a really good job of hiding the clouded messaging and poor setup for the final scene payoff.",2023-07-21
"Honestly? I couldn‚Äôt stand it. 

My friends all liked it, and I thought the casting/costuming/set design was great. But I found the script TERRIBLE. The jokes felt tired, it felt like it was trying to be feminist but it almost felt patronizing and insulting to the audience‚Äôs intelligence. Yes, I know women can be doctors or moms. I know that patriarchy is bad. I know all of these things and the 3 minute monologue from the mom just felt redundant. Maybe if I was over 45 and unaware of most of the feminist ideology of the past 10 years, this would feel powerful and good, but I was just disappointed. 

I think I had high expectations so it just really fell flat for me.

I also don‚Äôt think that the way in which it alienated men was accurate or useful. There are a plentiful number of valid criticisms of the way that men operate around women, and it instead chose to be critical of things that I felt like were more like bullying than a constructive commentary or even fun. 
Additionally, to a male viewer that struggles with seeing women as people to begin with (there are so many teenage boys whose minds are currently being rotted by the likes of Andrew Tate), this does very little to offset the narrative that all women are evil and just view men as things to be used. 

The male characters were completely flat, and while I feel like this was partially intentional, it made the empowerment of women it was trying to perpetuate feel disingenuous because of how exaggerated and pathetic the male caricatures were. 

I think I also am coming from a place of empathizing with the incel basement dwellers we have all come to know and love. The problem is that they‚Äôre so disconnected from reality, and their perceptions of the modern women are almost completely analogous with the beginning of the movie relationship between Barbie and Ken. I just feel like that‚Äôs a narrative that desperately needs to be dispelled and I can easily see this film being used as fodder by the far right propaganda machines that This is Society now and women just want men to be an accessory.

I did enjoy Ryan gosling as ken, and Margot Robbie as Barbie, and generally thought the casting was done well. It had some very sweet moments, but overall I did not like it.

TLDR: lukewarm feminism, unnecessarily alienating to men, weak script. But, some nice moments, aesthetically excellent.",2023-07-23
"The movie honestly felt like it was originally a SNL skit, but was left fermented and became an interesting tasting wine. Would be nice to have a blooper reel to see how often Ryan Gosling break character.",2023-07-21
[deleted],2023-07-22
"So many people saying ""haha so funny"" without even mentioning literally how deep it was... let's acknowledge all the messages behind it. It's insane how this movie hit on so many issues in today's society, the expectations, emotions, and being human.",2023-07-22
"I absolutely loved the first half of the film. I loved the sets, costumes, music, the outrageousness, the humour, the fun. Ryan Gosling was amazing as always. But I did not enjoy the second half of the film, for the most part (I still adored those essential elements I mentioned, like the sets, as they continued to shine throughout the whole film).¬†

My first problem with the second half is that the pacing really did not fit my taste. It slowed down a lot and the contemplative and deep moments went too far beyond for my liking. It felt very piled on, and definitely not the less-is-more style of the first half that I was really enjoying.¬†

Furthermore, Greta Gerwig‚Äôs particular feelings about womanhood, feminism, and gender just don‚Äôt resonate with mine anymore. I have grown a lot over the past few years, and my feelings have changed. I think we need to stop pointing fingers at men. It‚Äôs just pointless, especially as our society continues to push so much heavy messaging and expectation of traditional (harmful) masculinity onto their shoulders. Plus, a binary view of humanity is simply outdated and incorrect. And I just want to clarify that I know Greta isn‚Äôt trying to point fingers at men here. My impression of her message is that it‚Äôs time to free ourselves from all gender stereotypes, which is great. But the entire speech from America Ferrera, as well as the subplot of the Barbies taking back Barbieland and saying they ‚Äúdisinfected‚Äù the dream houses after the Ken‚Äôs were there just felt like more stereotyping.

Even though it‚Äôs happening at a glacial pace, Canadian society, at least, is making real strides towards liberation from gender stereotypes. We need to invigorate this movement by promoting Men‚Äôs Health funding and campaigns, discontinuing the use of the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù and switch it out for ‚Äúharmful/outdated masculine stereotypes‚Äù. We need to let the men in our lives know, as often as we can, that we don‚Äôt expect or need them to be strong all the time. We want them to feel connected to their emotions and express them. We don‚Äôt need them to make a lot of money. We don‚Äôt need them to just ‚Äútough it out‚Äù through injuries and hardships. And so on.¬†

Feminism means equality of all genders. So make sure to check yourself that you‚Äôre treating everyone in your life like another human, and work on edging out any conscious or unconscious gender biases you have. These are my beliefs, and watching Barbie really rubbed me the wrong way, so I can only think that Greta‚Äôs beliefs are just too different than mine for my liking.¬†

If the film had just been fun; a chase through the real world to capture Barbie and Ken, epic musical numbers, and hilarious references to the dolls and how we played with them, then it would‚Äôve been a 5 for me.",2023-07-23
"I went to see it with some friends yesterday and we all agreed that the story was weak and every other aspect was perfect. We enjoyed the music, the costumes, obviously the set, even the acting and the jokes, but all the feminist speeches felt very forced and none of use liked Gloria and Sasha (and her husband was so random!).

Don't get me wrong, we liked the general message of the film but also agreed that it was executed badly.

EDIT: And Allan should have had a special ending too!! He wanted to escape Barbie World and also become his own person and he just disappeared into the background again",2023-07-23
Shit. I‚Äôm worried if I watched the wrong movie or I‚Äôm low-key depressed. This film was bang average! Comedy was so forced.,2023-07-23
"I had very high expectations and I feel a bit disappointed overall. The barbie aspect was very cleverly portrayed but the feminist aspect although a good message felt too preachy and half baked. As a woman, I thought the movie would tug at my heartstrings but it didn‚Äôt get there. I wish the story showed me more of how patriarchy affects women by actually portraying it on screen rather than saying it. The flashbacks Barbie kept having would have been a good medium for that but they had no cohesiveness",2023-07-23
"Anyone feels like the more you watch or think about this movie the more it falls apart. Liked this in first viewing, now it doesn't feel as good as before.",2023-07-24
"Barbieland is pretty funny and I really enjoyed the heck out of it.  When I want to go see a fun summertime popcorn movie, this is what I want.  But people acting like it's some sort of subversive work of art are fooling themselves.  Barbie is a two hour infomercial for Mattel and, weirdly, General Motors that is targeted at women in their 30s and 40s that feel trapped in American capitalistic wage slavery as a feel good flick that let's them blame their lack of personal success on everything but the real villain, capitalistic wage slavery.",2023-07-29
"Barbie Barbie Barbie.

I really didn‚Äôt get the point of the movie. It felt like they had a bunch of good ideas that couldn‚Äôt  develop enough in the time allotted. Pardon the pun, but it made the movie feel plastic. 

Theme 1: Barbie discovering she‚Äôs a toy/ someone is making her feel this way (so who is playing with Ken??)

Theme 2: becoming okay with not being perfect/ becoming human 

Theme 3: Barbie land matriarchy vs real world patriarchy

Theme 3: Ken not feeling satisfied with life (mirroring women‚Äôs experience in the real world) and then finally being ‚ÄúKenough‚Äù. But he still doesn‚Äôt get his own house, or a better relationship with Barbie, or anything other than what he already had‚Ä¶ this feels like the opposite of feminism. (Also, there was nothing about normalizing boys playing with dolls, and I‚Äôm super disappointed)

Theme 4: mother/daughter relationship issues (I felt both their roles were written very shallow even with the big ‚Äúah ha‚Äù speech from the mom).

Theme 5: mother is having thoughts of suicide/existential crisis which leads Barbie to have these thoughts and cellulite? Umm, what?

Theme 6: weird Barbie not being accepted by the other Barbies. And pregnant Barbie! (So many missed opportunities with this for character development!)

I have so many questions and I feel they glossed over so many issues that were brought up. Anyone else share this sentiment?",2023-08-09
"10/10. This movie was everything i wanted it to be and more. A lot of posters are complaining about its lack of subtleness. While there certain themes thrown in the viewer's face, there was also layers of feminist theory and intersectionality baked into every layer of this film. 

Ultimately, I think think Barbieland is supposed to represent the women (and more specifically white feminists) who believe the feminist movement has already won- think the ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù type. So many women argue now that the feminist movement is done, equality has been achieved- ignoring the barriers still in place for many women, especially those with intersecting identities. 

That‚Äôs why it takes America Ferrera‚Äòs character and her daughter, women with intersecting identities, to teach Barbie that her brand of feminism has not helped or solved all the problems for every women. By the end of the movie, Barbie‚Äôs decision to leave Barbieland and go to the real world represents how she‚Äôs accepted this reality and no longer wants to live behind the veil of ignorance. 

It also represents how this ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù feminism is commercialized and sold to women. Like how Mattel and its executive board of men still control Barbieland behind the scenes, girl boss feminism ignores that men still hold much of power in the world. And tagging #girlboss on IG photos doesn‚Äòt change this. 

This movie is also clearly criticizing white beauty standards. This is illustrated by America Ferrera‚Äôs character, a Latino women, sketching a blonde white women and later telling Barbie ‚ÄùI can‚Äôt be you.‚Äù This is commentary on the impact of media that has traditionally presented white beauty standards as ideal has on non-white women from an early age. It also shows the impact of unattainable beauty standards on even women like Barbie- or real life women like Marilyn Monroe- who do fit these ideal standards.

America Ferrera‚Äòs speech at the end that cures the Barbies is literally the concept of double consciousness first theorized by W.E.B. DuBois, a notable early civil rights thinker and activist. There‚Äôs so much more that I could dive into, but whoever wrote this script is clearly well-versed in feminist film theory. I could write a master‚Äôs thesis about all the theory presented in this film.   


Lastly, I find it laughable that people think the end of the movie invalidates the message of the film. Barbieland reverses gender roles. So this represents how in the real world, even when feminists ‚Äúwon‚Äú battles like securing the right to vote, it still took decades for meaningful change to be implemented. Expecting that change to be immediate when gender roles are reversed is irony at its finest. They‚Äôre missing the point that both the patriarchy and feminism are institutions and ideas people invented to deal with living in a shitty world. There isn‚Äôt a magical way to fix it- we saw how everyone was negatively impacted in some fashion by both the gender roles and systems in the real world and Barbieland. However, by acknowledging this dynamic and emphasizing with each other, we can begin to fix it.

I think this movie did a fantastic job in bringing to light criticisms of both feminism and the patriarchy. It uses satire in a very similar way to the Scum Manifesto, which is going to going over a lot of people‚Äôs heads. Regardless, I loved every minute of it and am glad this movie is bringing these conversations into  the spotlight.",2023-07-25
"Honestly, the men getting roasted was the best part of the movie. ""You've never seen the godfather?"" ""can you restart it and talk during the entire movie?"" That was comedy gold!

Holy fuck was this so boring.  What on earth was all the hype about?,2023-12-17
"Huge stinker! Negative: Boring, bad pacing, terrible and nonsensical plot, cringe inducing pandering. The sequence where they enter the real world, get arrested with no repercussions, and then seemingly teleport all over LA was horrible. No world building or explaining why Barbie World exists, how and why the dolls and humans are able to travel between them. Will Ferrell and the evil white males were a total afterthought and a completely unnecessary story element. That chase scene in Mattel HQ was awful. The horribly insufferable daughter that wins the most slappable character this year. The ridiculously melodramatic ending that closes with a lame genital joke. Positive: Robbie and Gosling performances were good, and a few other standouts like Cera who deserved more character development. Overall I'm shocked not only that Mattel allowed the Barbie brand to be assassinated like this, but this was really the best they could come up with? Gerwig is more hype than substance, really not that talented. Move over Ant-Man, Barbie is the worst movie of the year.",2023-07-21

Work at a theatre and I can tell you right now Barbie will make a billion dollars. Already beaten Spider-Man: NWH‚Äôs previous record for most admits in one day.

I liked the movie but people defending it like they were involved in the production are unhinged. It's a movie about toys made by a multi billion dollar toy company who made the film to sell more toys.,2023-07-23
"I said this in a reply elsewhere related to a comparison with Oppenheimer, and thought it would be worth posting as its own thought:

Maybe nuclear bombs will still destroy all of civilization, but even that would be a natural extension of the patriarchal imagination suggested by the Barbie film.  What is Oppenheimer but a bunch of Kens playing with toy soldiers and fireworks?",2023-07-23
"I think it was exagerated.

The movie could have had a really good direction. I liked the first half but then everything seemed really forced to me.",2023-07-23
"I'm a feminist guy and I loved the message, and find it funny when grown men online call it ""anti-men"", projecting much? lol of course Barbieland won't get from Matriarchy to equal rights in a day, just like our world still didn't moved away from Patriarchy, that was literally the message! and I'm listening to ""Just Ken"" in a loop, I just love this song so much

Then again, I wish they just give the Kens their dream Wild West world! they don't even seem to have houses, of course, don't have them take over Barbieland, but why not have their own section? honsetly, I would love if they actully make a wild west toy line of the Kens, and finally give Ken the horse we want (Obviusly he don't want to be a ruler, he want to be a cowboy!) and his own dream Wild West Casa-Dogo-House! it mean, it's basicly free money!",2023-07-24
"I literally can‚Äôt believe that Mattel approved this, and I mean that in a good way.  A PG-13 Barbie movie that pokes fun at the company and the toy, and also is buried with messages of rejecting capitalism?  Holy SHIT.

"The movie is working on a lot of levels and sometimes I don't know if it juggled them all. There's the literal level, a story of characters with motivations. Then there's the corporate satire level, where jokes are making meta digs at the Mattel company. And then we have the analogy level, where it's talking about patriarchy, society, and manhood and womanhood.

And sometimes the Kens were analogies for manhood and sometimes analogies for how women are treated in the Real World. So, opposite things. And I just couldn't always tell when they were switching.

Overall I really liked it though.",2023-07-21

"I would not think this movie is bad but it did not exceed my expectations. I think this movie is playing a safe ground touching on feminism, even though there are still a lot of men overwhelmed and feeling attacked by watching the movie. It touches more on the journey of self-discovery and equality rather than what is being marketed, about feminism. The way they touch on feminism is too surface. I kind of wish the movie could be sharper or more savage in advocating feminism. Overall, I would rate it 6/10.",2024-03-23
"Feels like every time there's a movie with a Ken in it, he's a villain. It's kind of overplayed at this point.

Edit: I should clarify I meant Villain like ""Antagonist"", not as in he's evil. I just meant that Like overall it's a pretty good characterization of Ken in this film but for me, it's a little eyeroll-y because any major film that's like a comedic take on the Barbie franchise... the first thing they do is make Ken some sort of doofus antagonist y'know.

Ken is pretty much never the antagonist and is always on Barbie's side in basically any Barbie media outside of movie's like Greta Gerwig's Barbie or Toy Story 3.",2023-07-21
Thought the second act kind of dragged and was a bit preachy but overall would recommend,2023-07-21
"I appreciate the resolution to the Ken VS Barbie conflict at the end.  I read that most people prefer if the Barbies didn't support the status quo and created a new government that included men equally. 

However, this would give us an all too easy fairy tale ending where everyone lives happily ever when in reality, happily after doesn't exist.  A happy and perfect resolution only serves to make us feel good in the theatre and forget that we still live with the status quo once we exit said theatre.  I find this fairy tale ending highly patronizing.

Women still have to work harder to even stand out for a promotion against a male competitor.  Women get generally paid lower and are usually not in positions of power compared to men.  Hell, women have even less bodily autonomy in the US than men.

If anything, this is a realistic ending.  It's an ending that is designed to encourage discourse and to encourage everyone to challenge the status quo in hopes of a better future for both sexes.  After all, if stereotypical Barbie can create waves in Barbieworld, so too can we in the real world!",2023-07-22

I enjoyed the movie very much but there is a lingering feeling that I could have enjoyed it more with people around but sadly they were close to none. 


 I felt like it could have been way more fun, along with keeping the message intact, but the movie doesn't feel like it has high and lows (imo) don't come for me.

"SOME SPOILERS AHEAD‚ÄºÔ∏è

I‚Äôm going to be honest, I think this is one of my new all-time favorite films! It was such a creative take on the doll we all know and love. The attention to detail in the set and the fashion was iconic (it made my inner child happy!!) I love the historical elements of Mattel embedded into the film. And the writing was sublime‚Ä¶ the dialogue between the characters and the overall empowering messages from the film that the audience could relate to. We all struggle with insecurities to some extent, so I appreciated the theme of self-love/acceptance. My other main takeaways were: you shouldn‚Äôt spend your life trying to define yourself through someone else, enjoy the simple pleasures in life, knowing your worth, it‚Äôs ok for both men and women to show vulnerability, you are not defined by your career, confronting mortality, and recognizing the beauty of imperfections/pain. Another detail I loved was the diversity of the cast‚Ä¶ since Barbie is supposed to represent girls that can be anything, it was nice to see the idea of various  backgrounds represented. 

Margot Robbie IS Barbie. I couldn‚Äôt think of a better person to play this character. Ryan Gosling honestly was the star every scene he was in. I loved his rivalry with Simu Liu (that dance off scene was iconic‚Ä¶ or should I say beach off üòâ) Don‚Äôt get me started with the horses üòÇI was laughing way too hard üò≠üêé Alan and ‚ÄúWeird Barbie‚Äù were super fun characters. America Ferrera‚Äôs dialogue was amazing. I also loved the cameo with the ‚Äúcreator‚Äù of Barbie and the dialogue between the two of them. The ending resonated with me and made me tear up a bit! I think this movie will stand the test of time and become a frequently revisited classic. It‚Äôs a perfect balance of wacky fun and depth. Completely worth the hype. Beautiful film! 5/5 stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",2023-07-25
"I enjoyed it, Ryan Gosling lifts this movie to a new level, he was great. It could have had less of a ""men dumb and bad, women smart and good"" preachiness in my opinion. >!Kens are treated like shit and in the end, that doesn't change at all. I also didn't like the monologue about how being a woman is sooooo tough.!< Kind of tired of the feminist narrative that's not about showing how women are capable, but rather about showing that men are trash and the rest of the world is to blame for all your problems.",2023-07-22
"Let the downvotes rain, baby! I called it - Ken was the villain at the end, the whole movie was commentary on how women and men should go their separate ways, how men can only be incels or misogynists and that women are the future. Let's get this straight - Barbies have all of the power, Ken discovers what feels like to be in power and wants this for the people like him as well, switches how things are in Barbieland, Barbie turn Kens against each other and everything goes back to how it was with the Barbies in charge. What exactly this tells us? Did I miss the point? Also, Ken learns that he needs to be independent from Barbie while literally still being second to Barbie, who breaks free and becomes a ""human being"". Because women are the enlightened, the future, while men are these idiots who can not live without women and have to still learn to be independent. I have to call all of my single male friends, who have refused to be in a relationship, because women are high maintenance, and let them know that they are the peak of what men can be. ""But this is only about incels!"" Yeah, right, like the whole feminist movement lately have been anything but ""men bad, women best"". 

After this brief feat of rage - I support the message, though - my existence does not depend on a Barbie, I have to be my best self for me and my happiness should not be tied to another person. I am still not sure if feminists wants us to be equal in society, but at least Ken at the end had a redeeming and ""empowering"" moment and did not die as ignorant villain, for which I should be thankful, I guess.",2023-07-21
"This just didn‚Äôt work for me. The first 20 minutes when they are in the Barbie world was great. They hit all the notes and understood the satire of the movie. Quickly it spirals to some preachy self righteous lecture circuit about Margot Robbie not feeling fulfilled or wanting to be all powerful? I was confused by the messaging and thought they didn‚Äôt really know what they wanted to accomplish or realistically say? Should women rule the world or should men? They throw in a Ken find your own path effort at the end but this is after we‚Äôve seen the Barbies saying under no circumstance should Kens think to hard past the beach. They had ideas and wrote around them instead of knowing how to accomplish their story Just wasn‚Äôt for me, I will be on the short side of this.

Robbie looks like Barbie and Ryan Gosling steals the show and looks as if he was made of chiseled well sculpted plastic. The Will Ferrell subplot is unknowingly confounding  to me, just why? The Ferrell schtick is TIRED and again what was that entire subplot about, it had no pull to it and if you eliminate it completely nothing is lost. Even American Ferraro and her wiser then thou kid was a story that they didn‚Äôt really flush out past, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get back so we can get to the Ken takeover story line‚Äô. In the end the mom gives a speech and suddenly Barbies rule the world again? Which is the counter opposite of what they opposed with the Kens rule? That‚Äôs the best they could come up with? It seems they want to say: be yourself, but be what‚Äôs been designed for you to be(after all the Barbies profession are predetermined), and don‚Äôt let mean rule, but really women shouldn‚Äôt fully rule either? Idk, and when all else is lost Rhea Pearlman will speak to us, prolonging the movie for 10 unneeded minutes, about the joys of the human species‚Ä¶ But wasn‚Äôt Barbielands messaging to be who you are which was a Barbie? 

The Ken thing with Barbie not being interested in him is confusing also‚Ä¶ so if you are a noble prize winner that‚Äôs what you are. If you are president, that‚Äôs what you are. But if you are literally Barbie and Ken, we‚Äôll Barbie doesn‚Äôt need to be with Ken. Which fine ok, but doesn‚Äôt that mean the noble prize winner should be able to be anything she wants? Idk. 

In a day where I saw the story of the man who created the atomic bomb and Barbie I really didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be lectured more by the later.

I loved the costume design and some of the messaging was great, but I have this awful unshakeable feeling of disappointment I think? Im still processing. 

Some things that stood out to me - what was the whole thing on cellulite? What was the point of that? Barbie literally escapes to the real world to ‚Äúfix‚Äù her awful cellulite and flat feet? Then when she gets into the real world and compliments an older woman for being beautiful - it felt so‚Ä¶contradictory? 

Another thing that keeps bugging me is the way the society kind of ostracized the pregnant and weird Barbies. Isn‚Äôt the point of a female-empowered society to empower all types of women?

Lastly I totally thought the ending was going somewhere else. I loved that Mattel in the real world was grey and depressing, lacking color and ran by all men. I 100% thought that the end was going to have Margot Robbie walking into the Mattel corporation and seeing the grey cubicles turn to color and women being on the corporate board and Barbie ultimately taking a hand in actually empowering young women like she always thought Barbie could do. 

Maybe I was expecting too much? Or maybe I just didn‚Äôt understand some of these pieces, but at least the movie was a fun watch and it hit some good points in its messaging.",2023-07-23
"I was pretty disappointed with the movie after all of this hype. I felt like it was a lot of ALMOST‚Ä¶ almost funny, almost female empowering, almost individually empowering, almost smart. 

The Barbie sets and the costumes were what took this movie to the next level IMO. They were masterful. The story itself was boring. Also America Ferrera‚Äôs monologue about the plight of women, while accurate, took me completely out of the moment of satire, comedy, and inference. I really think AF, her daughter, and the entire Mattel staff storyline should have been left out. They made the story feel very clich√©‚Ä¶ but not intentionally so.",2023-07-26
"The first few minutes got me curious as to what the big social commentary would be. Following that came an hour and a half of what I felt like was an extremely shallow, moderate, and even safe critique of patriarchy. The movie promised a lot but ended up making the same 'patriarchy is bad' and 'capitalism is kinda lame' quips every modern sitcom director seems to love.
I felt that it was lacking, superficial, and ironic as it may be, plastic.",2023-07-27
"First of all it took me days to figure out what bothered me about this movie. I had been thinking about it nonstop so that is a sign that this is very important movie. Also there was plenty of moments that had me laughing out loud, and I mean like really laughing, so I can't say that I hated this movie because I didn't, but I also didn't love it like I was hoping to. I did not find it very deep and several important moments irritated me, like America's speech in the middle about the contradictions of being a woman (and I am woman). While true, I found it cringeworthy and extremely lazy writing, like ripped from a twitter rant five years ago. 

I finally figured out why the speech, and most of the movie, bothered me so much. Hear me out:

I have mentioned the the film didn't feel deep (honestly it felt like it should be called Feminism for Outer space Aliens). Part of this is because they way they stop the Barbies from being ""brainwashed"" by patriarchy is to give them the speech. But the truth is the Barbies have never lived in the real world and only experienced patriarchy for like a day, and they even allow it to happen! Of course they explain this with one convenient line about them having no defenses to it like the Native Americans did with smallpox or something. What?? Ok...Anyway, so they're broken out of the spell by have these contradictions explained to them even though they'd have NO concept of them whatsoever. Meanwhile, we have an AMAZING start to the plot: Barbie (because of America's character) is thinking about death. Why did they drop this?!!! What a missed opportunity! IF they could have Leaned into this universal, existential feeling then they could have framed patriarchy within mortality and therefore shown it to be the complete waste of time it really is. We're all gonna die, why be such an asshole? Etc. Then they could have explained THAT to the Barbies AND the Kens, too, and it would have felt so much deeper and more universal.

Also like many people mentioned it did feel hypocritical to me in many ways, and this could have helped that, too, I think. I honestly think Gerwig and Baumbach did the best they could under the circumstances probably (Matel trying to create a Marvel universe, essentially, and become hella rich, while trying to be cool and culturally relevant) so I don't fault them very much. The film is very much worth seeing. I do also wish Ken had a better ending. That he could have self-actualized a little more. Ryan Gosling was so funny in that part and they kind of did him dirty. He should have realized his dream of working with horses.",2023-08-05

I dont think this movie will be as polarizing as the comment section here suggests. Most people that would be upset wouldn't be watching a Barbie movie in the first place.,2023-07-21
"I had fun and I thought it was really funny at times.

It's also a movie about Barbie dolls. Like, you could imagine a little girl in our day and age coming up with a scenario on saving Barbieland from the Kens.

And I think that's fun.

I don't think the double standards will age well though, but it's a movie for women and girls about Barbie. There's a message there and it rings true in many ways. That said all men being portrayed as dizzy, bumbling idiots didn't sit right with me anymore than it sits right with me watching old media and seeing girls being portrayed as dizzy, bumbling idiots.",2023-07-21

"The movie was amazing, but I just had my worst cinema experience.

"I was starting to become worried about three minutes before they went back to Barbieland. That was the only time my interest wasn‚Äôt at 112% (and even then it was at like a 93%). Would they really spend the rest of the movie with Will Ferrell chasing Barbie?

And then they immediately go back to Barbieland and any fear I had was immediately put aside. That last hour of the movie, when Ken is revealed as the ‚Äúvillain,‚Äù is the hardest I have laughed in the theater in a LONG time. Just non-stop jokes that fired on every cylinder for me. 

To top it off, it‚Äôs genuinely SO fucking serious too? America‚Äôs monologue and the scene with Ruth at the end were so insanely touching and moving, but it all works so well. 

This is a masterpiece of a movie, on both comedic and dramatic fronts. No notes.",2023-07-21
"Marketing felt very misleading to the actual film. An enjoyable movie, but the 2nd half went into an entirely different direction than what the trailer portrayed.

First half kept the film fun while conveying some deeper concepts. Then you see the barbie's become brainwashed to forget their lives & worship patriarchy. The executive board plays no meaningful contribution to the plot. 

The overall message of the film was beaten to death by the end. Clearly conveyed before 15 minutes of Ken having an existential crisis & Barbie's conversation with Ruth. 

Not sure why the film pushed for that PG-13 rating either by adding only a couple explicit lines. Still a fun movie with a good message, just it missed the marker numerous times.",2023-07-21
"Did anyone else find the ending to seem like the result of too many cooks in the kitchen? The writing seemed to just go all over the place with no real meaning and resolution that left you kinda like what did I just watch? What was the purpose of all this? 

I‚Äôm also going to suspect there was probably more planned with the Mattel CEO‚Äôs that got shutdown by Mattel. I was actually mostly surprised how much they were ok with given how strict they are as a company.",2023-07-21

"I clearly wasn't the intended audience for this film. Hopefully those who were excited to see it received what they wanted. It seems at least that many commenters really liked it. I'm still a bit perplexed as to how, but everybody has different tastes and this just wasn't mine.",2023-07-22
"I feel as though this film is being held to a weird higher standard than a lot of the other blockbuster films based on established IP that have come out over the last couple of years. Sure, it's not as good as The Lego Movie, but it was more interesting than a lot of the other films this year (The Flash, Shazam 2, Black Adam, Indiana Jones 5, Fast X, Ant-Man 3, Super Mario). 

I'd say it was somewhere between a 7 and 8 for me, but still one of the better bigger budget films I've seen this year (I think only Spiderverse is clearly head and shoulders above it for me. Maybe Evil Dead Rise if I can count that).",2023-07-23
"It's more a Ken movie than a Barbie one, he has much more development than Barbie and can't help but root for him in his journey of looking for self worth and not be treated as an accesory, it's basically a rebellion against their tyrant oligarchs.",2023-07-23
"A lot saying the feminist message is outdated, would have preferred a more in-depth exploration of feminism or taken it a deeper direction. But, like, it was advertised as and was a fun and light comedy, and I thought it touched on more serious and reality-driven topics well alongside the comedy. And everything else - aesthetic, acting, soundtrack etc - I think is undeniably flawless. It made me laugh and cry and met all the expectations I had from Greta Gerwig.",2023-07-23
I feel like my partner and I are the only people on this app that straight up did not like this movie. I was personally over the tone and style about 10 minutes in.,2023-07-24
"This is coming from a woman that has seen the Barbie movie. I'm not on board with a lot of the messaging but in this movie. Overall it feels like an appeasement and simplification, ultimately people are celebrating it as a winning message for women. Which is a shame because they aren't thing beyond what is on the screen.

Barbie has never been allowed to be a mother. Why is that? In my life I have a successful career and I am a mother, although the world can make it difficult at times, why are we...and why isn't Barbie allowed to have both? Mattel has never let Barbie be a mom yet it's  very real issue that women face in the modern day and age, where we are force to be one or the other. Why isn't there an astrophysicist Barbie with a kid?

Second the movie showed different kinds of women and Barbies. But in real life while Barbies on the toy store shelf come in different ethnicities and cultures sure, but they all look perfect with unrealistic bodies. None of them have realistic body shapes and sizes.
The movie does nothing to address the undue pressures of beauty standards and prefection that Barbie has placed upon women for decades now. 

There is a weird barbie in the movie ""because she was played with too hard"" she is barbie that doesn't look perfect with odd haircut ect. Reinforcing the idea that there is a normal way to look and a non perfect outward appearance is ""weird"".

All this to say it's a movie and it overly simplified a lot in terms of messaging. I don't think anyone should take took much away from it.",2023-08-02

"Liked the movie but the ending felt weak. They could've done more with the Ken character.

Loved the Snyder reference though. WB hates the cult with a burning passion LMAO.",2023-07-21
"Just saw the movie and I loved it! Even though it might not have felt very nuanced if you make your own perspective on the film it can give a very powerful message. Women are still held down by the patriarchy and faced with struggles everyday, but we continue to live and find love in our surroundings even with that pain. The reaction to the movie proves that things that are geared towards a more female perspective are still strongly misunderstood and undervalued. 
 I also liked Ken‚Äôs story I feel like a lot of people are underestimating it. Ken was a victim of the patriarchy even though he didn‚Äôt realize it like a lot of modern men. I feel like it can tie to how men who are trying to understand what the patriarchy is  can take it to mean that they‚Äôre supposed to have some extreme amount of advantages over women and that it means their lives are supposed to be perfect. So they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs real because their lives aren‚Äôt perfect. Now he believed it but he believed that it should make him all powerful. He wasn‚Äôt talented at anything that made him important and he was angry that Barbie didn‚Äôt love him the way he loved her and thought the patriarchy would fix it. He only felt valued when a woman loved him or when he was important, like modern men he uses hyper masculinity when that‚Äôs having the opposite effect. He doesn‚Äôt try to understand his feelings and value himself as an individual. It just shows how toxic masculinity or the patriarchy hurt both parties not just women. Not only that but Ken is used as a mirror about how most women are treated in other media an accessory. Overall it can be a very introspective film if you choose to look at it closely. This isn‚Äôt a perfect analysis but just how I felt about it art is subjective after all!",2023-07-21
"this film was SO FUN !! and surprisingly powerful. I shed a few tears towards the end and really, really enjoyed the movie!

Margot Robbie was incredible as barbie and Ryan Gosling was a great Ken! Kate Mckinnon as weird barbie has me dying laughing. Loved it",2023-07-21
"First act was great, second act was pretty good, third act (outside of the Ken Battle which was brilliant) was kinda meh. A little too on the nose and I felt it sort of undermined it‚Äôs own message. 

Very solid 8/10.",2023-07-22
"If Ted Cruz didn't like the dotted line, just wait until he finds our there's a transgender Barbie",2023-07-22
"I actually liked Kate McKinnon in this ngl. usually her schtick of being awkward and weird doesn‚Äôt work for me. in fact, sometimes it‚Äôs downright cringe and gets on my fucking nerves (see: [her tribute to Hillary Clinton when she lost](https://youtu.be/BG-_ZDrypec) (I voted for Hillary and Trump can fuck off, but c‚Äômon. this was cringe.) and [her verizon ad.](https://youtu.be/MzEAJwKdVEc) but I must concede that it did work well for Weird Barbie and she was used sparingly to where it didn‚Äôt get old.",2023-07-22
"In addition to the metaphor of Kens being treated in Barbieland how women are treated in the real world, I think that it‚Äôs interesting to note that the patriarchy/misogyny shames boys for playing with dolls/Barbies. The Kens are underdeveloped because for so long and even still now, boys were told Barbies and dolls were ‚Äúgirl toys‚Äù‚Ä¶From who I‚Äôve interacted with, the people who miss the metaphor are the same ones who are telling their little boys not to play with dolls, ironically making them the reason Kens are treated like that in Barbieland.

I think the Kens taking over is also very symbolic of growing up in society as a girl. You grow up with your friends‚Äî guys and girls‚Äî and someday the boys you loved turn into misogynistic men. Like when did you start hating me? Why? And no, not ALL guys. Alan (slay King) is representative of the guys who stand by us even when things get rough. 

I loved this movie and I could literally talk about the layers to it all day.",2023-07-25
"I had a fantastic time. It mocked without being overly preachy or condemning and it communicated it's messages through an entertaining lens.   

Ryan Gosling was everything I'd hoped he would be. Nominate him for an Oscar at the least.",2023-07-26
"I expected a bit more of the movie. It was okay, funnier than expected, but everything seemed very on the nose. I was hoping for some more double meanings or hidden messages.",2023-07-28
"THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH KEN. TOO MUCH KEN AND TOO MANY CONFLICTING IDEAS.

The movie opened up a lot of ideas to explore--- Feminism, Body image, Misogyny, Sexism, the Patriarchy, Mother/Daughter relationships, Capitalism, Corrupt Justice System, etc.   
  
And ALL OF THOSE got completely erased because of KEN.  
  
So Ken had basically gone back to Barbieland to turn it into Kendom because he really really liked the patriarchy. The movie showed this also in a comedic way, and made it seem like the patriarchy was something so silly. The patriarchy was just men being shirtless, fur jackets, and beers. In fact, the patriarchy was actually THE WOMEN'S FAULT, because none of this would have happened if Barbie didn't have ""girls night"" every night!!! So suck on that Barbie, because guess what? All the other Barbies are happy that they don't have to think and just massage the Ken's feet.  
  
Now I understand that all the Barbies were like.... brainwashed or something? But they didn't even explain that well and made it seem like women LIKED being part of the patriarchy unless someone snapped them out from it. That's untrue. No women likes the patriarchy and we're perfectly aware that it's happening.  
  
Anyways, you at least expect Barbie to step up and save everyone BUT NO, she begins to cry about how she's ugly??? And just lies down and does nothing??? I was really confused as to why Barbie kept saying that she was ugly???  
  
And its not until Sasha's mom gives the ""girl-power speech"" for Barbie to snap out from it. But the ""girl-power speech"" is literally something from an instagram post. It's copy pasted from old tumblr. It was all ""Women have to be skinny but not too skinny"" like... yes, that's true, but also you're really reducing everything into this sappy speech of what a middle schooler realizes. If you remember Greta Gerwig's Little Women, the speech that Jo does near the end of the movie is much more in depth and explains a lot-- while the ""girl-power speech"" was barely even making a statement.  
  
And somehow that speech saves all the Barbies. And then they hatch a plan to distract the Kens--- and do so by completely grabbing all the stereotypes of what a women is versus what a man is and squeeze it into 10 minutes. It was all very just ""femininity belongs to women and masculinity belongs to men! Haha!"" Like in 2023? Come on.  
  
Anyways, Barbie gets Barbieland back and Ken begins to sulk. He starts saying that he lost interest in the patriarchy when it wasn't about horses, and that he just didn't know who he was if he wasn't part of Barbie, all that jazz. I have a lot to say about this scene specifically.  
  
First, WHAT THE HELL? It was just 5-10 minutes of Ken crying, and Barbie having to calm him down by saying ""Oh Ken, we know you started this patriarchy thing because I dismissed you. It's not your fault. You can cry now. We understand."" Like NO, because A) Ken knew what the patriarchy was about, he didn't do it for the horses, he did it because he wanted power over Barbie. and B) MEN BEING REJECTED IS NOT THE SAME AS WOMEN BEING OPPRESSED AND HARRASED EVERYDAY!!! FRAGILE MASCULINITY IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PATRIARCHY!  
  
Barbie had a line where she said ""I think I owe you an apology."" I was like... why? I thought maybe Barbie was going to apologize for leading Ken on because it was obvious that she didn't like Ken in a romantic way--- she literally said ""I don't like Ken the same way he likes me"". But then she started apologizing for having girls night and not appreciating him enough? What? If a man starts the patriarchy, are we to blame his girlfriend for not paying attention to him?  
  
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WHOLE SCENE AT ALL? I'm still confused on why Ken was so angry enough to oppress the entire Barbies in Barbieland, I'm confused why Barbie had 0 character arc and was apologizing to Ken, and I'm confused why Ken didn't even learn anything after that. He didn't apologize for doing anything-- he just threw his jacket away and went down the slide while being like ""I'm Ken!!!"" like we know, get out of the screen.  
  
and Finally, the ending... you expect everything to get resolved, but it doesn't. The male CEO of MATTEL continues to make money off of women and also contributes to capitalism by making an ""Ordinary Barbie"". The patriarchy in the real world was not affected/changed whatsoever. Sasha and her mom is magically best friends now. Everyone forgives each other. No one likes Pregnant Midge. And cellulites are ugly.  
  
But then Barbie, for some reason, wants to become human??? And I thought, okay, maybe Barbie wants to go back to the real world because she managed to defeat the patriarchy in her world, so maybe she's becoming an activist Barbie or a feminist Barbie! And then it just cut to another joke, haha, and the movie ended.  
  
I think the movie had a lot of potential, and it actually brought up a lot of subjects to the table--- but managed to end it without a proper resolution. If you asked me what the sole message of that movie was, I couldn't tell you. At this point it's fragile masculinity! I thought the movie would be more about Barbie, not Ken. That motherfucker got a whole song and dance break. Barbie didn't even get that. I mean at the beginning there was a party scene, but even then it was focused on how Ken wanted her attention. It was just all about Ken.  
  
I don't know--- I probably expected a bit too much from a movie from a multi-billion dollar brand that's trying to promote Barbie dolls. I should probably just be grateful that there were some golden moment near the beginning.",2023-07-22

"Ryan Gosling was the funniest part of this movie for me. Him practicing how to say no by imitating the guy had me laughing for way too long. The ‚ÄúI am Kenough‚Äù shirt. The odd fascination with horses. That ‚ÄúSUBLIME‚Äù. I kept seeing criticisms of his casting before the film came out and, in response, I kept telling people to watch The Nice Guys. 


I like the film, but, as a feminist who genuinely believes in the message it tried to get across about women just getting the short end of the stick no matter what, I think the way they went about doing that was too‚Ä¶ on the nose? Hollow? I‚Äôm not sure what word to use exactly, but I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of how it was handled. Either way, powerful message.

The Ken songs at the end felt out of place.

No one laughed at the Mattel Executives. They were painfully unfunny.

The mopey little girl became happy without a real explanation.

The Nicky Minaj song, unsurprisingly, sucked.

I did enjoy the Space Odyssey tribute.  And the dance party where Barbie thinks about death was pristinely directed. And a great Dua Lipa song to boot.  But then it sort of fizzled.

"Greta gerwig has done something genius

She aimed the movie towards movie intellectuals who'd understand subtle jabs at feminism, patriarchy and current world order but in doing that has created a movie for everyone

And she knows how to make a movie like barbie

The movie had me smiling for its entirety while also hitting me with too relatable shit at time amd also simultaneously highlighting feminism issues Which are valid. 

The final act again is a greater parody which on a superficial look will look like a manifesto of feminism but any able minded person who looks closer will understand she's just criticising that too much of anything is shite and world needs balance of both. 

Also Ken is done beautifully they explored rom com angle through him and led to greater themes and it worked. 
Man is going to be very relatable for too many people.",2023-07-22
"The movie was ok. Really went off the rails for me at the end where they decided to spoon feed the morale of the story in Barbie heaven/ fourth dimension and ending scene with Barbie going to gynecologist? What? 

I wish it just stayed campy and stupid but tried to do too many things in one movie. 

Also correct me if I‚Äôm but I really thought the end result would be equality but instead went back to a matriarchal society. Very weird.",2023-07-22
"I liked it. 
Simple, shallow and yet nice message. 

Related to both Barbie and Ken throughout the film. 

Obviously aimed towards women, but there are some nice messages for men too.

Very fun movie I don‚Äôt know why people are taking it so seriously.",2023-07-22
"I really enjoyed the movie. I absolutely love how they went all in on the absurdity and surreal humor. 

The ending was actually a lot different than I expected. I was waiting for both the Barbies and Kens to learn from the experience, as they had both been the oppressors, and form a more equal society, moving away from either extreme of toxic masculinity or femininity. Essentially the Barbie Land ends up going back to being a dystopian society instead of changing at all. It's a pretty dark ending if you really think about it. Now the Kens know what it's like to have freedom but are forced to go back into a life of submission to the Barbies. 

I feel like maybe the intent was to show Barbie Land was just as flawed as the real world, which is why ""our"" barbie wanted to escape it and be a human. But it was sorta disappointing that everything that happened was basically for nothing, and the Kens just go back to being second class citizens. Especially because we see they aren't evil, just misguided, and they feel pain and emotion just like the Barbies.",2023-07-23

"I saw it last night and I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought the message was muddled. I got the impression we were supposed to be rooting for the Kens, until the ending. A sentence I've read in countless feminist articles is ""loss of privilege can feel like oppression"", which I figured was the point. It was an allegory for the real world, until it wasn't. It seemed like it would have been an easy home run to have Barbieland becoming an egalitarian society and acknowledging that both the real world and Barbieland treated *both* sexes unfairly in different ways. Instead, during the climax, did Gerwig *want* us to root for the Barbies -- the ""oppressors"" -- over the downtrodden Kens? It lost me there. Maybe they shouldn't have made Ken so likeable.

It felt like they wanted the Kens to represent both Andrew Tate's brand of ""red-pilled"" ""masculinity"", so we had a villain to root against, *and* an allegory for women prior to having many rights and freedoms. So how does that work?

Also, during the whole ""Ken discovers patriarchy"" scene, as funny as that was, they made some weird choices. Some of their depictions of patriarchy were just men playing sports and Sylvester Stallone in various fashionable outfits (which you'd think Ken would already have in Barbieland). If it was Stallone during Rambo 2 or even the end of Rocky 4, I'd get it, but I don't get how ""men existing and doing things"" is patriarchal. I do get that the idea was that patriarchy makes Ken feel validated in a way that he never had before but if patriarchy is supposed to be the villain to be defeated, maybe I shouldn't have been thinking ""aw, look at how accepted patriarchy is making Ken feel! Good for you, Ken!"" Dismantling patriarchy and smashing the patriarchy are often touted as feminism's goals but the movie presents it being beneficial in some ways.",2023-07-22

It's definitely not lighthearted and while there are plenty of attempts to be comedic, it just didn't work (Ryan Gosling aside).

The bigger issue though is the never-ending spiel of how-hard-it-is-to-be-a-woman, which frankly doesn't resonate at all in 2023. I could literally feel the theater cringe any time the movie delved into that (which is often). The western world has bent over backwards over the last 50-odd years to ingratiate women into all aspects of society.

There are a few here that shares his sentiment, but the vast majority seemed to have really liked this and finding things enjoyable about it beyond it being just a fun time.

If his scenes were cut then we could have had more time of Ken and Barbie exploring the real world. They both make the switch just a little too quickly. Performances are great. Design is great. Dance scenes and songs were great but too few.

One complaint is how several of the jokes were spoiled by some of the trailers and by the narrator during the movie. Did we really need to be told that Barbie floats because it's like if a kid were picking her up? Would the audience have been able to infer that from a gag?",2023-07-21

"I only had a few complaints: that Will Ferrell and minions should have been cut after the chase scene, they didn't add anything and felt inconsistent and under baked. 

Also America Ferrerra's monologue was too long. I agreed with every point and it still made me glaze over. It should have been redistributed in smaller pieces >!to be used to wake each Barbie up. That way they could show that she had as many reasons as there were Barbies and could come up with something unique for each of them without ever running out of talking points. Done all at once it felt more like a grocery list than the ""getting everything off my chest"" moment it was supposed to be. The way they had her list it all out at once and then only took ""waking up"" shots for the un-brainwashing montage while leaving you to assume that she was repeating everything again didn't feel right, it felt disconnected. Using each point on a different Barbie would give each line its own weight and the audience time to process it individually.!<",2023-07-22

This movie was actually dope.,2023-07-22
"I get the core message, but I struggled to find myself enjoying the movie because the story was so much ""and then this happens, and then this happens, and then this happens"" and so much pointless fluff. I just found myself asking ""why is this even happening"" half the time.

Like what was the point of Allen kicking the shit out of the Kens to escape, only for them to go back to Barbieland and for Allen to never leave? What about the old woman whom Barbie complimented for being beautiful? I thought that was going to lead to going back to something else(maybe her deciding to become human?), but it just happened. Barbie complimented an old lady. Sweet, but why? I know the Scooby-Doo chase scene in the Mattel building was played up for laughs, but it felt like we could've spent a couple minutes doing something else, perhaps expanding on the relationship with the mother and daughter. Also, why was there a dragging scene of the kens fighting and then doing a dance number about how ken they are? That scene just went on and on and on and it was driving me crazy. 

It was an okay movie. I think, however, with the brand they had and the message they were trying to convey, it could have been portrayed or maybe better. 

That being said, costume and set design, plus the actors cast, were near perfect. There were some jokes that got a chuckle out of me. The 4th wall Margot Robbie actress breaking made me laugh, and ""I am Kenough"" was awesome. Every time Weird Barbie was on screen, I was chortling, and speaking of characters... I do feel the mothers speech about women in the 3rd act and the message was very impactful. If only the mother's character left enough of an impression for me to remember her name.",2023-07-22

"Honestly, movie was a ton of fun, absolutely loved it, plenty of laughs. In my cinema we had a good mix of dudes and girls, the dudes were fuckin cracking up with some hearty laughs. So glad it's been recieved well.

I actually got pretty damn emotional during it, like if they stepped up the love just 1% I'd probably have been bawling. I'm not sure why, not sure if it's because I'm about to have a daughter but it really got me, and I've seen the same said elsewhere.

But seriously, parents, can you stop taking your 6 year olds to 12+ films. Jfc, this movie wasn't appropriate for them whatsoever. Also they're really annoying.

>!I guess, seeing a world ran by Women, whereby men come second, and then seeing that destroyed by men spouting those Podcast grindset lines, really makes you do some inner self reflection on your entire setup.

>!I think they could have done more. Mattel wasn't seen as some evil corp? More ignorant and silly, not sure if that was to get the film greenlit or something. Ken not apologizing for everything he did didn't sit right with me either. But I just know if it did, we'd never hear the end of it, so perhaps it was good enough to at least get a conversation going?

"Barbie started off being fun because it was childhood nostalgia and dressing up in pink, it was an experience not just a movie. But it ended up being a movie that felt like a balm on what happens to women in the real world. The real world is horrifying, in our country, in every corner of this world, horrible things are happening to women, constantly, every day. So to be able to go to a place where women are free, can literally be anything they want to be, are supported, and are supportive felt surreal to see. It made you feel everything you go through on a daily basis, everything you overcome and ignore so that you can lead a normal life. America Ferrera‚Äôs monologue was amazing and in the words of Ryan Gosling‚Äôs glorious Ken, to remember that you are Kenough! That is just what I needed in the moment.

"I really wanted to like this movie, but I was genuinely just kinda lost throughout. It went from existentialism, gender roles, then to feminism, then to patriarchy, then to existentialism and then poof. >!barbie is human!<.

For example, >!I was expecting the plot to flow a lot like Elf or Enchanted in which someone from fantasy comes to face reality!<. It didn‚Äôt tho - which is fine - but I was struggling to keep up with what was going on and what exactly the main plot was cause there were like 5. 

Add the fact that I didn‚Äôt really understand a lot of the references‚Ä¶and well‚Ä¶it was just a bit of a bummer.

As someone who adored Barbie while growing up and considers myself a feminist, this movie resonated with me deeply. It beautifully depicted the complexities of humanity and the immense pressure we all face.  
  
What I appreciated most was that it wasn't anti-men; instead, it skillfully shed light on the harmful messaging that society imposes on all of us. The film's intention seemed to be promoting empathy, encouraging us to view things from different perspectives and walk in someone else's shoes. Overall, a thought-provoking and meaningful experience!",2023-07-27
"The easiest way I can describe this movie is with 2 words: Wasted potential.

I am easily in the opposite camp of whatever group this movie was trying to appeal to. I didn't want to watch what I assumed was going to be a dumb bimbo movie. (Un)fortunately I was dragged to this by a friend so I went in and tried to enjoy the movie.

And honestly I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought. It was a somewhat smarter movie than I initially thought and the camp was if not mediocre then at least adequate. The production was insane even though most of it was filmed in a pink hellscape. The actors put up a hell of a job and did their best. If I think of this as a movie, then it's pretty decent.

Except its not trying to be a movie for the sake of it. It wants to be smart and intellectual. It wants you to think about what you saw and reflect on it. The problem is, it is all over the place in what it wants to say. It wants to empower women but has to do in the most tell don't show way that it turned right around to preachy and cringey. It tries to show Barbie joining the human world as a big deal but the movie just shows that she had a horrible time in the human world, which just makes Barbie look dumb. Speaking of the human world, it takes up substantially less time than one would think, which honestly makes me wonder if parts of this movie were cut for time. 

Thing is, I do think if this movie were longer, more could be done with the messaging and storytelling. But also I am glad it wasn't longer because by the end when they just revert everything back to normal and Barbie goes to the human world, I find myself asking what was the point of all that? Worse, as a guy, I feel like I've just been told off for crimes other guys have done to girls. If they had just tried to focus on something rather than try to cover everything from female to individual empowerment to why the patriarchy is bad, this honestly could have been a great film. As it stands, it's a frustrating movie that wants to be everything when it doesn't know everything and which thinks it's smarter than it is.",2023-08-15
"This was one boring movie. I wish I could like it. The themes seemed fine but the execution was shoddy. Gerwig couldn't drive the impact home. STory and characters all were unengaging.

"I respectfully did not enjoy all of the Barbie movie. 

The characters were generally annoying and I found most of the plot points to be offensive to both genders. Though, It kind of resolves this by the end. It had some funny moments. Demonizing both men and women as a bunch of unempathetic stupid assholes as a core theme, implying that woman has to apologize for a man‚Äôs bad behavior, or implying that women in the real world are not doing enough (but have to overcome their faults? It‚Äôs Opposite Day,you wrote the script into a corner.) No. I don‚Äôt agree that men are responsible for all of a woman‚Äôs problems. That‚Äôs ridiculous. No, I don‚Äôt agree that women are stupid subservient assholes either. Who was this movie meant for?

The final joke in the movie after the cheesy as fuck finale leads to Barbie being empowered to visit a gynecologist (and then everyone faked laughed together. fun.)

It‚Äôs fine. 5/10.

Go watch Oppenheimer instead.",2023-07-22
"I really enjoyed the film, it was a colorful romp with a lot of visual intrigue and a solid bunch of actors and jokes. The film is very heavy-handed with the themes of matriarchy vs. patriarchy, but this is a Great Gerwig film, what did you expect? This is not a bland corporate ""please everyone"" film, and that's on purpose. 

Honestly, this feels like a vent film. The monologue toward the end about the duality of expectations for women resonated hard for me. It's nice to hear those sentiments out loud, some of them I had internalized without realizing it. In regards to Ken, I started out in the first scene thinking ""Man, Barbie should really be nicer to Ken,"" but in truth she was establishing a firm boundary with a man she didn't have feelings for. The fact that Ken went off the deep end because of that is *his* failure, not hers. Barbie has to go out of her way to defuse Ken's emotional burden at the end of the film, and even then he tries to re-route her kindness into a relationship, to the point of forcing a hug on her. Ken is the epitome of a Nice Guy, he won't take no for an answer and is explosive if he doesn't get his way (once he realizes that is an option.) Both Barbie and Ken deal with a lack of purpose, but it's Barbie who turns that into something constructive rather than destructive.

Also the soundtrack is a banger, several songs were written specifically for the movie and they are great tie-ins (the opening song, Dua Lipa's 'Dance the Night Away', Billie Eilish's 'What Was I Made For', Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with ""Barbie Girl (With Aqua)"")

Edit: A fun fact, ""Magic Earring Ken"" is a real doll from the late 80s/early 90s. Designers wanted Ken to be ""modern and hip"", so they went to clubs to see what guys were wearing. Only problem was, they went to gay clubs. In the movie he wears a Ken necklace, but in the credits you can see his original design with a ""circle"" necklace. Let's just say it was a ring, but not for your finger... ;) The doll was quickly pulled, but is now a collector's item and mascot for the gay community",2023-07-23
"6/10. I'm not sure how Greta Gerwig feels about Barbie, but it felt like another Velma (incept better) in this case it felt like it was taking this beloved character and using this character to voice an opinion on society. It was funny in some ways but after a while it seemed most the jokes were insults towards the Kens/men in general and towards Barbie for being imperfect at first. I came in to the theatre, as did many others, expecting this fun, enjoyable film about Barbie and Ken in the real world but came out with mixed messages. It's very memorable and the set and costume design is awesome, props to that team but the messages were a little too much. Also I'd hate to be a kid watching this, I don't think they'd understand a lot of it. It would have been much better if both Barbie and Ken shared a land and a house instead of all the Ken's being told no that they couldn't have cool important jobs like the Barbies.",2023-07-23
"I looked forward to Barbie, but it did not live up to the hype. Watching it once was ok. I would not watch it twice.  


The good:

* Funny jokes and ideas
* Set design
* Acting was good, especially Ryan Gosling. Where the acting lacked seemed the fault of the writer.
* It was cool that Mattel approved such a self-deprecating movie

The bad:

* The flow of the story
* The character development
* The message and emotions seemedforced

This movie had great skin but no bones. It had great jokes, great acting, and a pretty good but cheesy song. But the story was not compelling and felt forced. I never felt connected to any characters. 

The scene where Barbie and Ken enter the human world is clunky. Their realizations about the human world were fast and not believable. The movie Life Size depicted Eve's introduction to the human world with more grace. The first time Eve discovers real food, her reaction is hysterical, and you believe her. She is reacting to the world in only the way she knows. To be fair, I last watched Life Size when I was probably 9, so I am likely misremembering. 

But, when Barbie and Ken enter the Human world, they encounter very cliche events, and their reactions and realization are too immediate. I did love the joke where Barbie thought the bathing suit lineup was the supreme court. But then Barbie immediately gets catcalled by construction workers and responds like a feminist professor pointing out they had an undertone of violence. The situation was cliche, and it didn't make sense for Barbie's character to instantly assess a situation she had never been in. It seemed very forced and obvious, like it belonged in an improv scene.

In one scene, Barbie breaks down, crying that she isn't pretty or smart enough. America Ferrera gives her a pep talk about how hard it is to be a woman. This scene felt so out of place. Barbie's breakdown seemed unexpected. At no point in the movie did anyone expect her to be smarter or tell her she wasn't pretty. It was unclear where this breakdown came from. America's speech also seemed out of place. It felt like a substitute for conveying a message through the story itself. She talks about the complications of being a woman, but nowhere in the film do we see her or Barbie face those complications.

Similarly, the scene at the end where Barbie wants to be human seemed like the directors were trying to force the emotion.

I expected the movie to combine Legally Blonde's feel-good pink-filled feminist plot and Zoolander's quirky outlandish jokes. While the style of the movie was unique, the story itself did not come together nicely. It's disappointing because it could have been so good and unique with a more fleshed-out story.",2023-08-07
"Oh yeah, women ""just pretend"" to be bad at every sport lol",2023-12-25
"Really disappointed. 

The movie ends with the Barbies perpetuating the exact treatment that women of the real world face except against the Kens. Is that really the takeaway message here? That it‚Äôs okay to treat the Kens as less than in Barbieland since women are treated as less than in the real world? Seems like a huge missed opportunity to relay an inspiring message of true equality.

On a more positive note Margot Robbie absolutely knocked it out of the park. She was amazing here. 

Edit- You guys can downvote me all you want but it doesn‚Äôt change that the fact that this is *literally* exactly what happens in the movie. I hope with some time and distance you can see that.",2023-07-30
"I don't get why everyone loves it. The jokes weren't funny, it was too preachy, and the story was awful. Like why did it have to be all dark and sad? And the story is that there's the Barbie world that's like when kids play with Barbies, but also they can cross over to the real world, but also the company is aware that they're real and humans can enter the Barbie world, but then Ken brings back the patriarchy like it's a disease and Barbie doesn't actually like Ken. Greta Gerwig had the chance to make some changes to the Barbie lore and she decided we should know Barbie is not actually into Ken? Why do there? I'm not saying everyone needs a love interest, but why break up an established couple? Did we really need that lesson about finding yourself outside of relationships from Barbie and Ken? Did we have a problem with Barbie and Ken being a couple?

Maybe what I disliked the most was how they painted their brand as if the Barbies ""believe they've fixed feminism and made everything perfect for women"". Who here, before seeing this movie, thought of Barbie as a brand that believes it fixed feminism and made the lives of women better? Not me. They're like ""oh we're so naive and well-intentioned, we thought we did great for women and girls, but in this movie we acknowledge that in fact our brand isn't that perfect"". But I'm just like ""no, I never thought you were naive and well-intended and trying to save girls, I always thought you were just trying to make money"".",2023-07-22
[deleted],2023-08-02
"Ok but imagine going to *a Barbie movie* and your takeaway is that it didn't cater to men enough. Everyone complaining is literally proving the point that women can't exist or share experiences anywhere without men trying to make it about themselves. 

I thought that it was actually quite nuanced on the take on Ken, and their entire relationship was really interesting to me. Loved the scene where he told her it was his house as a mirror of what she'd said earlier. Loved her not knowing where the Kens lived. Loved her apologizing to him for treating him like an accessory and gently pointing out that he can figure out what he wants to be without the external validation of a woman. That's something that a lot of people really needed to hear.

Folks getting all bent out of shape about the lack of Kens on the *Barbie supreme court*... I'm sorry I can't stop laughing.",2023-07-21

"My mother just uncovered a nice little connection between the Kens and horses which may seem obvious, but only when she said it it clicked for me. 

I could not explain Ken's obsession with horses to myself entirely before being reminded that there is this mythical (Greek) creature called a ""**centaur""**, half man, bottom half horse. 

In my native language, Croatian, the word is spelled and pronounced ""Kentaur"" which makes the connection even more obvious, unlike in English. Centaurs are one of the symbols of **manliness, virility, male fertility** which help connect the two (Kens and horses) in the movie. 

Plus, the name, especially in Croatian, seems to be too similar to be a coincidence, if they did any research on the symbolism of horses, I feel like they must've stumbled upon the Centaur and a non-English pronunciation/spelling like Croatian, or the original and most likely choice  of **transliterated Greek (ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ --> Kentauros)**

"The more I think about this movie the more I wish it had invoked a disconnect between the barbies that were designed to sell clothes and the barbies with careers that were supposed to empower little girls. Our barbie‚Äôs existential crisis could‚Äôve been boosted by her feeling out of place as a barbie with no career or purpose in Barbieland, slowly being phased out. In fact, they could‚Äôve even shown her doll form in the real world as an older model passed down to Sasha from Gloria or even Gloria‚Äôs mother, as a representation of the first generation of girls who played with Barbie. Our Barbie‚Äôs malfunctioning not only because of Gloria‚Äôs mid life crisis but also because her doll form is showing signs of wear and tear. It probably could‚Äôve made Barbie crying over being ugly more impactful if there was a shadowy place in Barbieland for all the weird and broken barbies that Barbie was scared of being exiled to because she‚Äôs now imperfect.

I found Gloria‚Äôs suggestion of an ordinary Barbie kind of laughable and underwhelming as an ending but I do think there was a way to have a similar beat and hit harder. Have her suggest ordinary barbies that don‚Äôt have to be hyperfeminine or perfect or need to be everything because it‚Äôs putting too much pressure on young girls like Sasha. There‚Äôs space for tomboy Barbie and flat footed Barbie who likes sneakers. And the career barbies can realize they don‚Äôt need to be defined by their careers. President Barbie can be Totally Hair Barbie if she wants to be and vice versa. The Kens doesn‚Äôt need a Supreme Court seat but they can start by being given their own careers and jobs in Barbieland, helping ease Barbie‚Äôs burden of feeling like they need to be and do everything.

And I said this in a different comment but I really wish they had acknowledged Allan and Midge are a couple and done more with Midge than treat her as a gag (really, why wasn‚Äôt she with the rest of the discontinued barbies?) It would‚Äôve been funnier to reveal Allan is the only male doll with a successful relationship while the barbies and kens are in low commitment long distance limbo. Or worse, having  a modern Alan doll that‚Äôs completely separate from his 1960s version who‚Äôs in a relationship with pregnant Midge. Allan doesn‚Äôt have his 1960s Midge.",2023-07-26

"
Am I the only one who was so disappointed with the Barbie movie??? It just came across so preachy and just TOO on the nose. Overall it felt like they had so many ideas and wanted to shove so many messages and themes all in one movie and absolutely none landed a strong impact. 

Like I don‚Äôt even get what the overall message was of the film because it was just too rushed, the plot was so chaotic and nonsensical. Overall watching it, it just felt like I was watching the rough draft. Literally every scene they just HAD to spell out what misogynistic, patriarchal, unjust thing happened and then FURTHER DISSECT THROUGH DIALOGUE. To me that‚Äôs when you admit you have a shitty film if you have to spoon feed every message to the viewer. 

Like can they not trust us to understand through their acting what the message is??? I would have loved if they told a simple story about a mother and daughter troubled with injustice and adversity and having Barbie reflect this through her slow and SUBTLE transformation and keep the BULK of the story with Barbie navigating the real world instead of this random back in forth between the worlds??? The mother and daughter literally just felt like a random accessory to the film when they should have been the focal point. And then make Mattel such a huge part of the film when their purpose is so unimportant?? Also just unfunny. I love Will but didn‚Äôt laugh at a single joke he said because again it was just TOO FORCED. And then bringing the actual CEO for the tearjerker at the end, but how can I cry when I don‚Äôt even know wtf I‚Äôm crying for? ‚ÄúMothers stand still to see their daughters grow‚Äù um did we even get to fucking see that? Then the cliche ass montage of old times family videos of daughter running and old women smiling while a cringey Billie Eilish wannabe sings in the background. Did not do a damn thing for me. 

Just too many subplots, characters, messages shoved into a short ass film. It just lacked any depth or impact. It‚Äôs about QUALITY, not quantity. By trying to list out ‚Äúevery‚Äù issue a woman goes through in a random speech in the movie from a character that should have felt important but wasn‚Äôt because you didn‚Äôt take the time to give her any sort of backstory other than a measly flashback felt just so lazy and just not good. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was so excited for this film and it did have many great qualities and did mean well but in my humble opinion fell SO SHORT. It‚Äôs becoming a theme with a lot of movies. They underestimate the impact a simple story told WELL can have rather than trying to save the fucking world and bring peace between the genders through an hour and a half Barbie movie.",2023-07-26

"I was honestly really sad about the Barbie movie. The adverts surrounding it were misleading, and the movie turned into a feminist parody with no solid plotline. It was like it was trying to be political and comedic simultaneously, but the writers got lost. If they had wanted to make a feminist movie, I feel like they could have touched on some other subjects rather than just briefly discussing them in an empowering speech (that wasn't that inspiring). 

For example, Barbie didn't actually help Gloria with her real-life issues; they just magically got resolved through the power of taking down 'Ken-dom'. Gloria was struggling with serious things, such as thoughts of death and anxiety that she hadn't made the right career choices. Barbie didn't comfort her about her body changing (the cellulite, for example); instead, she felt almost selfish because she just wanted to fix herself. These are real issues that everybody faces throughout their lives, not just women but as the film was made primarily for woman empowerment it feels odd that this was not addressed. Because of course Barbie doesn't age she doesn't have these issues but there still could have been scenes where Barbie realises that she doesn't fix every women's issue just by having a ton of careers and clothes.

Because of course, Barbie doesn't age she doesn't have these issues but there still could have been scenes where Barbie realises that she doesn't fix every women's issue just by having a ton of careers and clothes. ed this important issue under the rug. I think it's great to see so much diversity in the dolls and the movies but the diversity can't be acknowledged without realising that it didn't always used to be this way. Multiple movements have pushed for Barbie to become diverse, she wasn't originally created like that which is what makes it such an important moment in time for women everywhere. 

Another thing that wound me up about this movie was they managed to surround the major plot points about a man: Ken. How on earth did they make a movie about a woman surround a man? I completely understand the whole point of Ken's character was supposed to represent how women feel in the real world: overlooked, ignored, powerless etc. But I also feel like the story could have gone a hundred different other ways. I am not bashing on Ken or Ryan Gosling for that matter, he had great character building but why did we need so much of it? Why couldn't the movie have been about Barbie and Ken discovering patriarchy in the real world and both characters discovering the good and bad elements of it? When I say this I refer to Ken more than Barbie. 

One thing the Barbie film did not do enough of was address the discontinued Barbies. Aside from the odd joke, the film completely didn't utilize them enough as key feminist elements. For example, Pregnant Midge and Growing Up Skipper were just lines to make us laugh. How amazing would it have been for Barbie to stand up for them? To say 'there is nothing wrong with having a baby without a husband' or 'puberty is nothing to be ashamed of'. (This comment does ride off the knowledge that you know Pregnant Midge was discontinued for having a wedding ring on) If anything the movie projects ""You can be anything you want - just none of these things or you will get discontinued!

To be honest, there was nothing wrong with the ending but also nothing right with it either. It just kind of left a dry taste in my mouth. For one thing, a 'normal' Barbie? I don't really see the point in that. One of the main things I loved about Barbie was that everything she did was an achievement, whether it was a career, adventure, etc. She changed from a normal pretty girl with a boyfriend to a woman with multitudes of potential. There was nothing ever wrong with being 'normal', but there is reason to celebrate her achievements. As Margot Robbie said in one of her interviews: ""Barbie went to the moon before women even had credit cards."" I am not saying Barbie was the sole influence behind feminism but god just seeing a doll doing something you couldn't must have made women think, ""Hey! I want that too!"". 

The move to make Barbie human wasn't really something I was personally interested in. I don't understand the flashes of people she sees at the end or why she wanted to become human. I suppose it was to feel 'alive'? If someone could explain this to me that would be great. 

I just feel like the movie didn't hit home with me because it was moving between two goal posts, trying to feminist and trying to be funny. There were obviously moments were is succeeded like when Ken was playing guitar on the beach and he was like ""I am going to play for four and half minutes and stare awkwardly into your eyes"" - I feel like every woman has been in that position or something similar. However aside from those few moments of reliability, the movie just had too many balls in the air and couldn't catch them. 

Feel free to disagree with me, my opinion isn't only the correct one and maybe my standards were too high but I just thought it was going to be super funny or super feminist which would have been fine either way. I think maybe I need to watch it again to get more of a grounded opinion of it but right now I am not it's biggest fan.",2023-07-24
"As a guy I thought it was a 'good movie', loved the visuals, really liked the overall world building, and humor.  I absolutely loved about  75% of it.  Only a few missteps keep it from being a great/perfect barbie movie:

1. The unbearable brooding fem-natzi teen archtype. Being that I was a nice teen growing up, it sucks seeing writers shoehorn the overly-smug negative-teen (who also hates thier extra sweet loving parent) archtype into movies where it serves no narritive purpose. The daughter was unnecessary, and really served no purpose plotwise.  Either cut her or at least make her a bearable side character.

2.They leaned into the feminst angle too hard. While I am not a proponent for modern feminism in general, I do think the male vs female, ""Partriarch"" vs Barbieland was funny and could have continued  to fine throughout the movie if they would have just kept it light hearted and tounge and cheek, as these are concepts that Barbie and Ken have to contend with during thier exposure to the real world, and later during thier existential crisis'.  But by the time the mom started monolouging super hard with a feminist twist at weird barbies house, it took a fun movie into cringey eyer rolling feminist propaganda territory... 

Up to the point in the movie,  I was thinking how it would be a fun movie to watch with my kids (boys and girls), but after the narritive went full on anti-male, and the Barbies started to seduce the Kens and cause infighting/war... I changed my mind.  Not a message for kids on how to treat the opposite sex. 

Also, its always been a part of Barbies narrative that Barbie and Ken were an item, and have broken up maybe once. They could have played on this but... hollywood. It didnt make sense that Barbie showed NO interet in Ken.  

TLDR:

- 99% of the cast did a great Job.

- Great Visuals and Humor

- Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. And stole the show.

- Enjoyed Will Pharrell

- Overall a good movie that could have been GREAT, but was *slightly* maligned by hollywoods need to make everything a political statement.

"I was pretty disappointed with the anti-men undertones in some of the plot elements such as the focus on the production company being all men and the general gaslighting of ken's behavior, but i think that in the end it managed to deliver a nice message about self love. Despite that, i enjoyed the movie a lot and the art direction was by far my favorite part of the movie!",2023-07-22
"A couple of things that bother me about this movie - after seeing all the Kens portrayed as stupid and the real world patriarchy portrayed as buffoonish morons, we get the scene with Gloria‚Äôs husband where he‚Äôs mocked for learning a language by his daughter and wife - then again later when Gloria is driving she mentions/implies a older cooler boyfriend than her husband taught her to drive. It‚Äôs a small thing but it‚Äôs just shows where the writers head was at, that even when there‚Äôs zero narrative purpose for it, the male characters exist to be mocked and shown as losers who their female counterparts aren‚Äôt really into.

Another point is the scene where Ken is crying - Barbie is telling him it‚Äôs alright to cry and the movie seems to be trying to send the message that it‚Äôs alright for men to cry and not be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù, and yet - the scene is played partly for laughs. Contrast that with Barbies crying scene which is show seriously and as a sympathetic tender moment.

So Gerwigs movie is contradicting its own point. It‚Äôs alright for men to cry, but men crying is also funny and a subject of comedy to her. (There‚Äôs even a funny song where Ken sings about his fragility). So which is it? Is it alright for men to cry or is it high humour when they do? Does Gerwig herself know or understand the contraction in her narrative choices for this movie?
I just find that aspect of the movie is really unintentionally representative of feminist confusion/hypocrisy.",2023-07-31

"I have some things to talk about ""Barbie"" and another film, being ""Fight Club"". SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL.  
Also please note I watched the film yesterday, and thus may have forgotten some things/misremembered. Thank you.  
>!Barbie is a genuine companion piece to Fight Club. Both films in a sense encourage/may encourage a particular gender to become stronger and more capable, particularly because they are being held down, but in reality both are just using that as a way to appeal, to talk about much more important and far more nuanced points. In particular I have also felt Fight Club is really a film about Cults, while Barbie is about Power Dynamics in general. That's why it may seem that Barbie is mean spirited. Because it's main goal is not to be a role model for people to be. It is trying to show real world dynamics, not just in regards to gender but also media and social classes and even false perceptions in Hollywood, and leaving the door/doors quite literally open to far more stuff (the hallway of doors in the Mattel building). It's one of the smartest films I have ever seen, but it hides it all really damn well, so as to most folks watching it don't get bombarded. But it's truly there.
I think Barbie is trying to be a crash course in power dynamics, with particular focus to gender but also the other things as well. In Barbieland, Barbies are powerful and thus posses many of the same traits as powerful men in our world. They are cocky frankly, and not good people. Kens meanwhile are submissive to Barbies, who treat them as shit. But Kens are also not necessarily the best of folks. AKA the real world. This gender reversal stuff is obvious, but what I think folks are missing is that this is actually a key to decode the whole film. The moment you do that, you realize in reality the film isn't trying to be purely feminist message, but actually far more interested in how things today are playing out. And have been and will keep being. ""The real world"" here still isn't completely the real world. I mean I know that is obvious, but it let's you realize the points made in it are also trying to be satirically done.
In particular, Margot Robbie's Barbie (hence forth just called Barbie) can be considered to be a powerful/sheltered person realizing issues of the real world, and understanding the depths and nuances of it. Akin to the Buddha one can say, especially with a character saying ""my savior"". Ryan Gosling's Ken (hence forth just called Ken) I feel is a more satirical critique of Hollywood and Media, with it's overt messaging but not understanding the truth and deep nuances of it, which will actually make things better. This is extremely well showcased by the critical scene in which Barbie and Ken do show up to the real world at the Beach, and Barbie feels threatened not just by of course the awful cruel men, but one can also view it as her feeling threatened due to the unfamiliarity of it. Like a rich kid walking through a bad neighborhood. I feel this is most powerfully represented by Barbie stating she ""has no genitalia"" to the construction workers while Ken saying he has ""all of the genitalia."" And the construction worker's reaction being ""okay."" Now one can say this is obviously a way to represent how Barbie shouldn't actually be subject to the comments imposed upon her, but I also really really feel that this is a hint to indicate that ""hey guys, it's not just sex"" which is absolutely obvious when Will Ferrel shows up.
Now before I fully open that can of worms, I want to talk about Ken. Ken I feel is representing/a way to learn the powers men have in reality (duh), but also how many women are currently being in Hollywood and media. ""I have all of the genitalia."" Bingo you know. Particularly, I think Ken represents (I am going to get so much shit for this) negative folks who are supporters of Feminism who, such as many people and particularly actresses in Hollywood, are toxic by trying to demean men. ""Patriarchy"" is a substitute word for Feminism. Remember, its all a big gender reversal. Of particular note is how even then, a thing about Ken's actions is how the other Kens in Barbieland actually do become smart and educated and aren't completely useless at all anymore. Sure they abuse their power, but they aren't idiots now. It is akin to showing that positives even out of that toxicity is emerging, including int our own real world.
Okay, now time to talk about Barbie again. So Barbie is very much a representation of rich and powerful folks. She just gets her new clothes with Ken and then runs away not paying for them, like how many view rich folks doing today. The kicker being how innocent it is for her. But then she relaizes the struggles of normal folks and how WOMEN AND MEN are struggling. More evidence to suggest that the film even if it shows women being unfair towards men (at leats Barbies to Kens), this film doesn't hate men. But then comes the moment she meets the key to all of the films great intentions. She meets Will Ferrel.
Will Ferrel's character is really important. His pink colors and power clearly symbolise he is like Barbie. One could also say his emasculation to an extent is a nod to Fight Club, and believe me there are far bigger nods then that (the color pink it self is a big one). But Will Ferrel is representative of the Status Quo most of all. He represents how he deeply cares about things being the way they are for power and corporations. They want things to remain, cause they have figured out ways it can benefit them in frankly nuanced manners, but still don't want that equilibrium disturbed as they are lazy now. They may even be aware of reality (he refers at the end to know Ruth), but as long as she is hidden away, that's okay for him. Reality isn't of concern if it doesn't impact the image crafted. Now there is some falsehood in this as Mattel literally in a sense is letting this film make Barbie into a feminist icon, but I feel that is represented as well with companies not being complete idiots to laziness if more profits can also be achieved. Its a unique thin line they traverse. They are both creative and lazy, greedy yet helpful, changing and static. They are enigmas, that frankly even they don't understand in how they impact the world, and are imapcted by it too. But one thng is for sure, and this gets more into the hollywood side of things. A powerful and un-nuanced image is appealing, with Will Ferrel shooting down the idea to have both Barbie and Ken well represented.
Okay I relaized I skipped actually tlaking about Barbie (kind of stream of conciousness here), but to talk about her I need to talk about Ken again. One of the scenes that caught my attention is when Ken talks to a guy and hey says the patriarchy is very well hidden. This patriarchy I don't think is a substitute for feminism in this instance, but actually refers to have male power nowadays is hidden. But it then does something really brilliant in my opinion, and has a scene I think years from now will be referred to as one of the greatest scenes in movie history. The scene when barbie meets ruth in one of the hidden rooms. Ruth tlaks about her power, and is literally HIDDEN. The main point of the film is present their. Power dynamics are way way way more complex then portrayed in general media. We all know this as well. It's just a question of who ends up in the spotlight. This hidde quality is amplified in Babrieland after the Ken's take over, with the Barbie's secretly reasserting power while being hidden. Of particular note how this is represented in the real world is by Will Ferrel as well. He is a harmless man, beholden to Women's interests. But the patriarchy is now hidden too.
Finally, I want to talk about Alvin and the family Barbie is trying to help. These folks are the real people, who like Will Ferrel also don't understand their true power, yet kinda may as well. I will be honest, I feel I need to watch the film again to make truly conclusive points regarding them, but some ideas is younger generations impatience and also young childrens vulnerablity to media, but also how positive role models exist trying to do the best they can. A healthy power relationship. A mom and her kids. Feel kinda shitty to call this a power based relationship. Other things maybe how Alvin is really awesome, but is screwed in both eras of Barbieland. How the common person is always in the dumps, women more so in reality, but men too. The film nicely showcases this by showing how men out of power are still better off, but still not as well of as powerful folks in general.
As far as allusions to Fight Club, there are literally two references to it with men saying let us help reflecting the ""WELCOME!"" ad and the literally ""you are not your"" type of speech, all the more confirming this film's wish to be a companion piece to Fight Club, which is needed I feel (taking into account Fight Club is my favorite film). As far as other things, there are so many more little if not big things but for now I think this is a lot. This film is way smarter then people are giving it credit for, which is why I felt it was important for me to write about this.!<

"Just got home from the movie and God it was a blast. I smiled through most of the movie and caught myself bursting out laughing too. 

Only part I'm still kind of on the middle on is America's monologue. I liked the message of the movie, but I liked it when it wasn't being so serious about the delivery. It gave its message for most of the movie without breaking its comedic routine. The movie just leans so much into humor though that it kind of caught me off guard. Not a bad thing, but when you try to dance on that fine line between being serious and comedy it can be hit or miss. Luckily, I think the movie JUST stays on the line with it though for me. Overall I loved it.

Every time Ryan was on screen I cracked up. The Kens in general were just plain silly. The watch bit killed me. And once I found out they actually sold the ""I'm Kenough"" hoodie, I instantly bought it lol well played Mattel.  Great movie overall!",2023-07-25

Where as the misogynistic men are afraid of a movie that send this message that females should have equal rights, want to control women. They can't stand this movie, because they don't want women to have have equal rights,  powers.

But again, I didn't get from this movie at all that there was hate towards men, the women want to be more powerful than men.

People get triggered by this movie, ARE the problems in our society!! Frankly sad and embarrassing as a fellow man reading their retarded asinine hateful opinions *Sigh*",2023-07-23
So based on what yall say patriarchy is bad and Kens need to stop being so steotypcial and Barbies need to help them but it ends with going back to the status quo instead of man and woman work together like we do right now?,2023-07-23
I liked it. Barbie has always been a political statement. I'm a man but not a traditionally masculine man so I suffer from the patriarchy as well. I was bullied. So I kind of feel for women since they've been getting the short end of the stick for thousands of years,2023-07-23
"I liked Barbie but surprisingly the crowd full of mostly women didn't seem to like it as much as me. I was laughing more than them. The part where America Ferrera gives a long monologue about how ""Women can't be this but gotta be that, too this but too that"". All I heard was a woman behind me sigh.  That monologue seemed to just pause the entire movie and be like ""ok just incase the audience doesn't understand what we are trying to say, we will have a character explain it to the audience as if they don't already know"". 

Even though I still enjoyed it, there were just so many moments that felt a little over-the-top. Like when some guy on Malibu beach slaps Barbie's ass and then she defends herself and her and Ken go to jail. Only to be followed by 2 cops sexualizing Barbie in the most unrealistic way. It's parts like that which make the movie just not as good as it could have been. That scene in jail was only there to have 2 cops comment on how hot Barbie is, it's not even a joke or anything so it just seems pointless besides ""Aren't men pigs?"" 

So while I did like the movie, it is definitely full of so many poorly landed jokes which felt almost awkward in an almost full theater with 80% women. I expected the entire crowd to applaud at the end, but when ""Barbie"" title popped up at the end, only 1 lady clapped.",2023-07-25
"For me it was... a meh story carried by everything else. The actors were fenomenal, the costume and stage designers nailed it and the dancers were a joy to watch on the big screen. But then comes a problem with the story I have not seen mentioned: it did not decide what it wanted to be. Too many mature and kinda flat jokes to be for kids of all ages, and an in-your-face feminist message that made it too much for those that wanted a light watch and not enough for those seeking an actual deep commentary on society. The only one left is to view it as satire and just roll with its nonsense when characters act based on plot (or joke) convenience if they even matter at all. If it just picked a side and developed that it would have been a lot better.

Power to those that got emotional and felt a deep conection to the characters but for me it did not, even when I really wanted to. So, given that art is subjective in its enjoyment, I think this is one of those movies that can only be graded individually by whoever watches it. And also that someone might not like it for other reasons than being a triggered alpha male.",2023-07-27
I didn't like it because it didn't make me smile and got bored too quickly. The only thing I liked were the 80s neon outfits.,2023-12-14
"I read the wikipedia article's ""plot"" section and i swear to god it sound so horrifically exaugurated like it was made by one of those ""anti feminism"" channels that spew garbage, and i was so shocked to know that is the ACTUAL PLOT OF AN ACTUAL MOVIE MADE BY HOLLYWOOD i literally had a laughing fit lmfao",2023-07-21

One of the best movies this year and one of the funniest I have ever seen,2023-07-22
"Easily one of the most joyous cinematic experiences of the year. A frequently hilarious, fiercely imaginative, achingly heartfelt, whip-smart comedy that gleefully satirizes the Barbie brand ‚Äî and takes razor-sharp shots at the Mattel corporation, to boot ‚Äî while doubling as a sincere love letter not just to the dolls but to the women and girls who grew up playing with them, warts and all, as well as to womanhood in general. Perfectly chosen ensemble cast.",2023-07-23

"Solid 7/10. Really good ending scene, but I'd change 3 things.

1. MORE ALAN.

2. Plan with Ken's getting Jealous, and fighting to miss the vote was wierd. Should of Ben more subtle, and funny. 

3. I was pretty sad that they barely had anytime in the real world. I was kinda expecting a ""elf"" movie, where Barbie and Ken are out of place in the real world like Will Ferrell in elf. However, it seemed like the whole film was in Barbie land with it barely showing Ken and Barbie in Real World. I really felt like they could have let Ryan shine in the real world with more masculine men humor, and Margo have more time being in a mans world. It's like they were there for 3 scenes and rushed back.... I wish it was more of them adapting in the real world and less barbie land.",2023-07-28
"All that girl power, but Barbie can just walk away? That kind of spoiled it for me.",2023-08-01
"Feels like it steps on a lot of its social commentary, back pedaling and overstepping, on what seemed like clear subtext - but, I suppose it's subjective and opinionated what one got out of the movie. You have literal manipulation as a turning point, only to reverse that into Ken not being sure of who he is? Not bad finding oneself but how the story got there was, from a thematic point of view, a bit backwords. Anyway, a few funny moments, a well-thought out movie regardless of what one took from it. It had a nice aesthetic thanks to clever production design. Ryan Gosling is very good.

Also, poor Allan. Movie just shat on him.",2023-09-15
I‚Äôm not complaining but that felt like a super long SNL sketch,2023-07-21

The first act Is some of the most fun I‚Äôve ever had wathcing a movie, the third act was also a great time, the second act in the real world with will Ferrell? Phew that was a head scratcher",2023-07-22
Anyone else think they should get rid of upvoting/downvoting on these movie discussion threads? I want to know what people think both good and bad. People who didn't like the movie even if they express that politely are getting their posts downvoted so they're hidden.

Borderline expected Ken to start quoting Jordan Peterson,2023-07-23

Right amount of fun and satire while also Making A Point. That‚Äôs impossible. I feel like I can‚Äôt talk shit about the pacing or messy plot because we‚Äôre all supposed to like this one! 

Idk, how I felt about the movie kinda proved its point which is cool. Liked how it was both silly and cerebral even if a lot of the jokes didn‚Äôt land with me.",2023-07-24

I think Sorry To Bother You did surrealism-as-a-vehicle-for-a-strong-social-message better. I also found it a bit boring, but i guess that's just me. I would of loved to see the Barbies remove all their makeup and drop their pre defined roles as barbies to see true freedom from their ""box"".",2023-07-31
I didn't enjoy the movie so much. Some parts where great rest boring and nonsense,2023-08-01
"I have such mixed feelings about this movie. The cast were amazing. This was possibly one of the best all-round performances I've seen, with Ryan Gosling stealing the show in literally every scene he was in. The direction and set design were also great. They went hard on the style and it really did work, particularly for the Barbieland sections.

But the writing was... just so hit-and-missy. The pacing felt all over the place, sometimes jumping from scene to scene like it wanted to skip through them, with scenes essentially just being rapid fire jokes with no downtime. Then we had scenes that dragged on for way too long and slowed everything down. The stuff in Matel felt like this, as well as the montage of saving all the Barbies from the brainwashing. I felt like I shouldn't have been bored, but I really was during that montage. And, on that note, i get to the messaging of the film. 

I really wanted to go into this with an open mind but it's hard not to see the issues with the theming, since they had the subtlety of a brick. Men are stupid. That seemed to be the main theme of this movie. I think this works for the Kens. All the Barbies and Kens are these weird, absurd caricatures and I think that absolutely works. Playing the hypercompetent Barbies against the dumb himbo Kens was a good commentary on how these toys are actually seen in real life. I liked it. The issue comes when the 'real life' men are... also all weird caricatures. 

Will Ferrell and all his goons (fun fact, 5 of the 11 members of Mattel's [current Board of Directors](https://corporate.mattel.com/investors/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) are women, but let's ignore that, because it doesn't fit what we want to say) and the construction workers and the cops and just *every male character* in the real world was just a weird strawman. And, again, I could get this as a general style, but the real world women *weren't* treated like this. Sasha, America Ferrera, Ruth, the doctor Ken talks to and the mum Ken talks to were all played as normal, real characters for the Barbie cast to bounce off. 

It just sits as *weird* to me the contrast between how the women were treated (real, complex characters with motivations who we're meant to care about) and the men (weird goofballs who almost universally exist to be the set up and/or butt of a joke). Oh, and a special note to the 'joke' where a brainwashed Barbie claims that the brainwashing made her feel 'overly invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League,' which is not only already a dated and not particularly funny joke, but also just a *terribly* flowing line. In fact, a lot of the quips were pretty awkwardly written and could have used another draft.

Beyond that, the moments where a character stopped to look at the camera and rant about how hard it is to be a woman felt hollow and preachy especially as, again, Ken's own insecurities and issues, which largely mirrored what was being said by America Ferrera, were played off as silly. Not only did these moments feel very soapbox-y but they were just... boring to me.

There is a lot to like about this film. There were a good few parts that made me laugh (the Pink! song reprise with the new lyrics was genuinely great) but there's also quite a few parts that made me roll my eyes or check my phone because it just felt like the writer using a character to rant, which isn't particularly entertaining to me.

This felt like it was going for the EEAAO brand of 'absurdist humour meets meaningful and emotional themes' and, to me, it failed. Because EEAAO used it's absurdism to carry it's themes, while Barbie stopped it's absurdism to monologue it's themes at you. 

Also, the Kens deserved more. The movie seriously took an abused underclass of citizens, had them revolt and take over, and then had the status quo restored and actively mocked them for being against it. Then Helen Mirren made some sort of weird revenge quip.",2023-07-25

What the fk did i just watched bruh,2023-07-21
"There were 3-4 parts in the movie which got big genuine laughs out of me, coupled with a combined 30-45 mins where I sat there thinking, ‚Äúthis may be one of the stupidest things I have seen this year in cinema‚Äù underlying themes were forced as well as the resolution being unrewarding and bland. 

Definitely a movie for people who value wacky social commentary over a real plot and character arcs. 

Unpopular opinion: Not terrible, but not a recommend",2023-07-23
"I liked the movie but the Barbies emotionally playing with the Kens towards the end was cruel imo. I was fine with the distraction plot line but once they were all at the campfires and guitars part and the Barbies intentionally ignored the Kens and tried to inspire jealously... that's just fucked up. Hurting someone to further your own gains is not right.

I think the ending should've had Kens going off to create Kendom next to Barbieland or ended with Kens and Barbies in equal position of powers. To those of you saying ""it shouldn't have ended like a fairytale"", I call bullshit. The movie spent the entire time hammering in the fact that Barbieland was *not* the real world. It would have been perfectly acceptable to have it end idyllically. The way it currently ended made the Barbie's all seem like hypocrites for denouncing patriarchy and yet using underhanded tactics to ensure matriarchy. ""Having Barbieland emulate the real-world but backwards"" might be a wake up call to the few dudes who actually realize what the message is (Women are still not represented equally in positions of power in the real world despite claims of equality) but by and large I think most men and women who see the movie are going to miss this message and just be put off by the glaringly obvious hypocrisy instead.",2023-07-23
"4/10 really disappointed actually started falling asleep near the middle of the movie.
Positives costumes and set. 

My girlfriend gave it a 3/10 she's korean hated all the propaganda. There a little less tolerating to all that over here in asia. Wonder what other foreigners will think.

Interesting side edit: it's scoring 5 amongst men in South Korea and 9 amongst women.

The reservation rating is also very low. So possibly barbie fans draging their men to it.",2023-07-25
"I‚Äôm not the target audience at all, but I thought this movie was pretty meh. The acid trip of Barbie land at the beginning was great. The comedy was also very good. 

The story was a little disjointed and it felt like I was being hammered with the message the entire time, which I never like in a movie. Subtlety is best. 

Also, a female empowerment movie does not have to put down men and masculinity to be empowering to women.",2023-07-25
"I'm a man 36 and went with 2 women.
It was pretty good, the feminism message wasn't as one-sided as I heard, pretty much ""both men and women should listen and care for each others feelings"".
One part I found a bit too much was of the real life woman who manages to un-brainwash the Barbies.
The whole people expect things from you and it's difficult and contradictory. Well shit, men have the same issues, different expectations but same results.",2023-07-26
I like how this movie comes out and everyone‚Äôs saying Barbie always was a pushing feminism and positivity‚Ä¶yet we‚Äôre bitching for years that barbie was awful and created unreal expectations set on women,2023-07-21
"The plot had a good start, but about half-way through it lost me. The end of the script seemed to have a hard time wrapping things up, and I think the movie sort of vilified men. Everyone is a victim of the patriarchy, and it poorly individualized men and their emotional agency with a lack of closure to their storyline in the movie. Not to mention, how many monologues did we really need to understand the message of the movie? 

It had a few funny punchlines and decent moments, but the storyline was a little messy and politically radical. I wish it was more... tasteful",2023-07-22
"This movie really needed to decide what the audience was going to be. The plainly-stated, preachy feminist themes were clearly spelled out for children, and it ended up dominating the plot in the entire third act, but a lot of the humor would go right over the heads of children that age. 

To a kid, it must be confusing and seem very random. To an adult, it‚Äôs condescending. It needed to commit one way or the other. 

Also, the plot was very disjointed. This would have worked better as the long journey to find the kid that owned Margot Robbie. Instead 20 minutes we were in LA was really pointless and in retrospect the trailer was a bait-and-switch in that way.",2023-07-22
"I found it to be a frustrating and unfocussed movie experience.

The movie touched superficially on several themes worth exploring (and for which Barbie was a fine starting point) but never committed fully to exploring any of them.

It all felt very self-referencial, I doubt that many people will see the world in a new way thanks to this movie.

Structure and pacing were also an issue, the movie felt very disjointed. Also, the world building felt rushed and contradictory in several spaces.

Humor often fell flat, the few really funny moments were all provided by Ryan Gosling's Ken.

Both Robbie and Gosling did great, but the script didn't give them enough to work with, imo.

The tone was also a huge issue for me. The movie seemed unsure whether it wanted to be scathing satire, silly goofiness or emotional inspiration and it honestly didn't succeed much at any of those.

I liked the concept for this movie but it didn't feel as if it went much beyond the concept.

I'm pretty disappointed.",2023-07-22
"It‚Äôs incredibly disturbing to me that people think this movie is ‚Äúnothing but politics‚Äù when the idea of Barbie in general carries the exact same theme as the movie. If you come out of this movie thinking it‚Äôs shitting on men for everything wrong in the world, I hope you can surround yourself with people that can help you understand why that‚Äôs entirely wrong.",2023-07-23
"I do think that the message of this movie is confusing.

For example, a lot of the discourse online discussing this movie isn't paying attention to the fact that the status quo set up at the start of the movie isn't supposed to be good.

Ken's line of 'Every night is boys night' is just cementing the fact that Barbie's treatment of the Ken's is wrong. But then at the end when it seems equality is reached one of the Barbie's completely undercuts it by saying the Ken's can have really low level jobs in the court or something, so Ken's are still second class citizens of Barbie land at the end?

So if this is an anti patriarchy message by showing that one gender ruling isn't right, then shouldn't it be an even playing field for both Ken's and Barbie's at the end? Or should we be taking away that it's okay to point out that the Patriarchy (or a matriarchy) is wrong, but it's fine to keep doing what's comfortable?",2023-07-23
"The Barbie Marketing Team definitely deserves a HUGE raise.

Seriously, they did a FANTASTIC job. I went yesterday to see this movie, and from the trailers I was expecting a fun lighthearted comedy movie not taking itself seriously, that follows a similar concept to the Truman Show or the Lego movie. 

It truly subverted my expectations when the movie halfway through turned into a Vice article about toxic masculinity and patriarchy. I thought the whole patriarchy thing was gonna be some side joke about Ken misunderstanding it and doing some minor shenanigans in the backround until Barbie or someone explained it to him then it would be over. I didn't expect it to turn into the MAIN PLOT of the second half of the movie.

I didn't get how Ken even brainwashed the Barbies in the first place, but the scenes of the undoing the brainwashing was especially funny! Like how they were repeating stuff you hear on Twitter or one of those ban-friendly subreddits about toxic masculinity that Barbies shouldn't even know about. I liked the meta-joke where they undo the brainwashing on a Barbie and get her to remove her dress/skirt because ""she's a physicist, she would never wear this"". The joke being, of course, that the movie is trying to be so self aware it becomes unaware by imposing how a woman should dress, especially a Barbie of all.

Some people seemed to not like the ending, like how they solved things by turning the patriarchy back into a matriarchy and not giving the Kens equal rights, but those people don't understand the message. Barbie world is like a mirrored dimension of the real world, with roles switched (real world of course meaning USA), so Kens being as powerful as women in the real world makes sense. Sure, one may argue something like how real life society, history and politics are way more complex and oppression of women is especially gone in the western world legally and culturally, and the now self aware Barbies with no complex problems could at any point make their world equal, but you shouldn't listen to these kind of people.

I don't know why the other guy and 2 girls I went with said they didn't like the political messages and couldn't relate at all, I think the movie definitely absolutely needed those messaged and that they really, really fit a BARBIE movie.

Overall, I think this movie was great and a must watch and is worth a 7 or an 8 using the french grading system",2023-07-24
"I keep telling myself, it was a fun movie but the more I think about it, the more disappointed I get.

Just for context, I am a 36m, so sure I wasn't the target audience, but believe it or not, in a house of two teenage daughters and my wife, I have been the most excited about this movie since I saw the first trailer. The trailers just looked fun, which is what I want to see, I want to see a fun movie.

I am not na√Øve enough to believe there wouldn't be a message in the movie for young girls, I even welcome it. My issue is, after 20min of the movie, all the upbeatness and fun of the movie disappeared. It turned negative and kind of just stayed there. Sure there were still some funny moments, but for the most part, it was just preachy and negative.",2023-07-25
"Are people missing the point of the movie? It isn‚Äôt trying to be nuanced about the commentary it‚Äôs providing. Its lack of subtlety isn‚Äôt an accident.

Did no one else think it was weird a movie about how bad the patriarchy is suddenly abandoned it‚Äôs female main character for half an hour at the end to give the biggest dramatic arc and character growth and biggest set piece to it‚Äôs male co-star?!? Watching this movie was like eating ice cream at the gym. And how did everyone who put on their pink mini skirt and high heels feel when the movie went out of its way to explain that Barbie and her over sexualization was damaging to young girls? The cognitive dissonance surrounding this movie in our current cultural landscape is head spinning.,2023-07-26
"This was a really weird movie. The whole thing was an odd and unfocused existentialist narrative that didn‚Äôt quite seem to know if it wanted to be a comedy or something else, the tone jumped around a lot. I liked the movie a lot, but I think a lot of people are going to go into it expecting an adult oriented Lego Movie and be very confused and bored after a half hour of not getting that. I give them credit for doing something different, as it would have been very easy to do a paint by numbers sort of film, but I‚Äôm not sure the whole Toy Story does Nietzsche vibe worked as well as it could have either.",2023-07-27
This was a total miss for me.,2023-07-26
"I just saw it with the wife and just didn‚Äôt ‚Äòget it‚Äô the messages felt a bit muddled and confused in what it was trying to say:

- Why was the real world so slapstick? (Where America and her Daughter were the only normal people really)
- The bloke who was clearly happy they were in a patriarchy and hiding it better‚Ä¶weird inclusion

- I don‚Äôt think the movie addressed the patriarchy well, it was a flat thing of ‚Äòmen have done this to women‚Äô rather than ‚Äòcenturies of history impact men and women‚Äôs behaviour‚Äô (toxic masculinity being reinforced onto men by both men and women)

-They made mentions of stuff which would‚Äôve been interesting to include e.g. how women cause problems for other women

-was this meant to be a movie about mothers and daughters?

-I don‚Äôt get why Barbie decided to be human at the end? (We had that one scene where she watched some men laugh and chatted to the old woman‚Äî-but didn‚Äôt seem to have any major changes other than that)

- America Ferrara‚Äôs monologue about women again made it sound like a thing that was purposefully done to them by men‚Ä¶when many of the things she talks about effect both sexes one ways (and then women have some issues men don‚Äôt, men have other issues women don‚Äôt‚Ä¶or experience the same issues in different ways-like showing emotions)



I‚Äôm guessing there was more story about mother and daughter in there originally and it got cut to focus more on Barbie? (And the dad just chucked in there)

It was very funny in places and I get some of the messages it was going for (as a psychologist who knows stuff about sociology too) but it was too shallow in doing them.



I think Little Women by Gertwig and ‚Äòeverything everywhere all at once‚Äô covered some of the stuff about society and mother/daughter relationships better‚Ä¶maybe even Legally Blonde does ‚ÄòBarbie feminism‚Äô a bit better",2023-07-27
they‚Äôre clearly make fun of the kens by keeping barbieland a matriarchy but having kens continue to be side characters with minor roles in society. the feminism is very focused on barbie and her self discovery it‚Äôs weird you‚Äôre associating that to ken when that‚Äôs not what happened at all. the barbies defeat the kens by manipulating them to fight each other and restore control over barbieland. not mention the amount sexism barbie experiences in the real world and also the mattel ceo being a reflection of them. this movie is very women focused and pro women. it‚Äôs so pro women that some men might see it as ‚Äúanti men‚Äù,2023-07-21
"I went into this movie excited. Been wanting to see this since last year when I found out about it. Our theatre even got all dolled up for the occasion, to include having a Barbie and Ken look-alike pose for photos with the moviegoers. It really was a spectacle!

All the good vibes died about 20ish minutes into the movie. It really just seemed like this was the directors hatred of men being brought to bear, as the Barbies seem vindictive and malicious, the Kens are moronic manchildren, and the end of the movie basically makes it out to be that the Kens and Barbies need to separate, which would imply that they think men and women should seperate. And that‚Äôs just one aspect.

I had gone into the theatre hoping to experience some nostalgic barbie land moments. To be filled with joy watching my favourite childhood versions barbie come alive on screen. To sing, ‚ÄúI am barbie girl‚Äù at the top of my lungs without a care in the world. 
Was that too much to ask for? 
But no. Instead, I got slapped across the face with so very many societal issues that I was just, SO NOT mentally prepped to deal with. I wanted 2 hours of sheer joy but instead got existential crisis. 
Yes, they were right. 
Yes, it‚Äôs nuanced topic that needs to be portrayed more.

Enchanted did fairy tale to real world impeccably well. Would be hard to duplicate that with the same success in my opinion.",2023-08-12

"The Lego movie is my favorite animated movie of all time. I put it top 5 movie of all time for me as well. 


I love how that movie is so creative, so funny, so filled with subtle commentary and how goofy it can be. I know it's one giant commercial for toys and I know it's made by a mega corporation kind of making fun of themselves but I don't care because it's such a joy to watch. 


When I saw that a Barbie movie was coming out made by Greta gerwig I knew it would be a similar idea to that. I figured he would be full of social commentary and generally harp on society today. What I was expecting was something subtle, goofy and funny like the Lego movie. However, the Barbie movie is the opposite of subtle in any way. The middle monologue in this movie made by the mom legitimately felt like a collection of tweets I've seen. And it was recited like it was a stage play it was so bizarre. It was so bizarre how this movie just felt the need to spell out every single theme every single time. Which is weird because this is Greta Gerwig and both her previous movies did subtly so well. 


I am also disappointed at how unfunny this movie really is. Each joke felt like an SNL sketch and the majority of visual jokes just felt so on the nose. This movie relied a lot on randomness for humor that I don't really think worked. It just wasn't that fun to watch outside of the first scenes in Barbieland.


This movie just felt so all over the place in the worst way possible and could've used a lot more subtle in its messaging that's for sure.the plot just felt so lost and uninspiring.I'm very disappointed in Greta I thought she would do better.


A quick side note is the daughter character was just so poorly written. As soon as she started yelling at Barbie the first time I 100000% thought she was gonna call barbie a facist and sure enough she did. That teenager was just a machine for buzzwords.",2023-07-23
I watched Oppenheimer and Barbie today watched Barbie last but tbh I wish I watched it first. I watched allot of reviews and people say they were surprised by the movies story. But the second they get to the real world it just became so predictable. Patriarchy and consumerism are evil. I understand the message the director wanted to convey but it was done so poorly. The movie requires no critical thinking skills cause it holds your hand and then just mansplains the message to you. Maybe that was point the director was going for. Not to mention allot of the characters weren‚Äôt fleshed out the mom and daughter honestly could‚Äôve been written out of the movie without hurting any of the story elements. It was a really funny movie tho and the ending was beautifully done but the journey that got us there felt like a different movie. You can‚Äôt just shit on a gender for 65% of a movie then switch up and say you just need to love yourself and not revolve your life around me. Like no duh captain obvious. Oppenheimer literally left me speechless but maybe that just got my hopes to high for the Barbie movie.,2023-07-23

"haven‚Äôt seen this mentioned yet, but after the Ken fight, Kingsley Ben-Adir drops the dumb guy Ken front and says in a very serious voice ‚Äúwe were fighting because we didn‚Äôt know who we were.‚Äù That made me laugh so hard and I think I was one of five people that did.",2023-07-21
"As a young man, I seriously didn't expect to get this invested with anything Barbie-related until now, let alone successfully pulling off a live-action feature-film based on ""Barbie"" for mainstream audiences to enjoy. This movie has a lot of heart and actually thought-provoking at times while also not taking itself too seriously. When news was first announced that a Barbie Movie entered production on April 2014. Tons of users including me weren't sold on this idea fearing it would end up like one of those cheesy Barbie DVD movies.

During my childhood, I used to avoid anything ""Girl related"" in fear of getting picked on or bullied by a few male students and friends I made during my childhood and school years. Before the 2010s hit, there was a huge stigma  when boys would be judged harshly if they liked anything ""feminine"" and ""cute"". You would even be called or accused of being ""Gay"" just because a boy genuinely liked anything female-centric and not interested in merchandise and anything made for your own gender. TV Tropes even has a trope about this called [""Girl-Show Ghetto""](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto).

Craig McCracken's [""The Powerpuff Girls""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MiaSr-0ug) was one of the few exceptions, because while it starred a trio of little girls with super powers. It was actually unisex since both genders of different age groups were deeply in love with the 1998 series since it's an affectionate parody of the entire Super Hero Genre as a whole. There's a reason why McCracken was reportedly pissed when he discovered CN decided to launch a short-lived [Powerpuff Girls fashion line called ""Dream in Style""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95XxUZaF7m8) and why the PPG Reboot gained tons of backlash. As infamous as brony community is. It sure did spawn tons of decent content creators (such as [The Living Tombstone](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLivingTombstone), [Saberspark](https://www.youtube.com/@Saberspark), and [Jenny Nicholson](https://www.youtube.com/@JennyNicholson)) who started out making My Little Pony content before finding their own identity. 


This is why I strongly admire Sanrio since they managed to find way to drawn in other demographic from different gender and ages to a specific Sanrio Character. Such as Aggretsuko, (Sanrio's first adult oriented series) was specifically made teens and young adults (mainly towards grown woman) since it focused on Japanese work culture but managed to find a larger audience when it became a Netflix Series. Before Aggretsuko, Sanrio launched a series called ""Sanrio Boys"" which featured a group of pretty young men who are big fans of Sanrio Characters as a way to make male fans feel more confident of liking anything from the opposite gender. 

I remember five years ago, Sanrio granted the film rights to Hello Kitty to Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema after a five-year courtship [which was first announced on May 2019](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/03/5d1c9b4e3a4d-hello-kitty-to-make-hollywood-debut-in-warner-bros-film.html). [Cut to 2021 when it was revealed to be a live-action/CGI hybrid movie](https://deadline.com/2021/03/hello-kitty-movie-directors-jennifer-coyle-leo-matsuda-new-line-1234704997/) with users giving similar reactions to the announcement as the Barbie Movie did back in 2014. 

Hopefully, Sanrio alongside New Line and Warner Brothers are paying close attention to the amount of positive reception and box office results Barbie gets so they might go all-in on a decently made ""Hello Kitty Movie"" and future films starring Sanrio Characters.",2023-07-21
"I loved it!! The jokes hit and I appreciated that it still felt like Greta Gerwig, just on a larger scale. I do wish the pacing slowed down at some points and that some of the narration was less on the head. Like talking about the weird barbie. I think from the promo pictures everyone already assumed a child had cut her hair up and drawn on her, but it felt tedious to go over that in the movie itself. 

The plot was totally different than I had expected too!",2023-07-22
So I‚Äôm just taking this movie as being Gravik‚Äôs origin story,2023-07-22
I did the barbenheimer experience expecting it to be a lot more jovial but instead it was a little crushing in its own way too. Still one of the best movies I've ever seen though. I particularly loved how it had content for all age groups AND still managed to be extremely funny.,2023-07-24
"I (34/M) did the Barbenheimer experience. Saw Oppenheimer (loved it) and then saw Barbie. I go to a lot of movies and I have never been in a theatre with so many women. Especially young women.

I liked the movie. Greta Gerwig is fun. There are lots of laughs, and I was impressed at how many bullets Mattell agreed to take. There is definitely some self-awareness in this movie. I know there are lots of complaints about it being too preachy but I would disagree. I thought there was good balance between entertainment and not taking itself too seriously with a good amount of feminist message. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was the tightest script, and I think the themes got a little bit messy in spots, but overall a good fun popcorn flick with some intelligence.",2023-07-25
"I liked the movie. I didn't love it for several reasons, but manly because it dragged a little with the Mattel HQ and the Ken storylines. Margot was the best and I wish she got more airtime and that Barbie's storyline didn't revolve so much around Ken. In some parts they tried too hard to be funny but as charming as Ryan can be, Ken's part was a little to much. I get that he's an asshole and that serves many of the arguments of the movie, but my problem is that the movie tries to convince us that his bad behaviour is funny and it mostly isn't (while also passing Barbie's distress as kind of a joke sometimes? :/).
I also think the mom and daughter were a little wasted potential. The movie plot exists because of the connection between Barbie and the mother and it feels as if that plot was discarded halfway in favor of Ken's shenanigans. There were parts I was asking myself why there were so many men talking? But maybe that's on purpose to mirror real life?
In the end, I think the movie succeds in being a conversation starter. It's not an easy movie to make and interpretate and that is good. It's subtle and heavy handed at the same time and it tries to balance a lot. It was impossible not to deal with gender if you wanted the movie to reflect the legacy of Barbie and its impact on women and women's rights, and the movie is successful in this.
I liked the ending conversation with Ruth, (the creator) a lot, and the fact that Barbie turned from a reactive character to someone with agency. Wish we had a little more of those moments instead of empty song and dance numbers (I'm a fan of musicals but these were mostly boring to me). Sets, costuming, hair and makeup do deserve awards for their fantastic work.",2023-07-25
"This movie was such an interesting meditation on symbols. I kept thinking about some of the opening lines of Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle:
  
""In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles...Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living...The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of society, as part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all consciousness.""
  
A pseudo-world apart, where the non-living operates autonomously, presenting itself as both how the world is and how it could/should be, and which sustains its existence through objectification? Sounds a helluva lot like Barbie Land to me.",2023-07-26
"Is it me or the review are weird??
One day i look amd they are at 3.5 on 5 and the next day they all at 4.5 or 5 on 5???",2023-08-06
The fact that this movie was made while there are women being oppressed by there government is a dn shame. We need freedom for all people now.,2023-09-04
This movie made me feel so many feels- I still don't know how to feel but it did touch the core of me and it has moved me and changed me. I have ALWAYS been a Barbie girl - I knew the movie was supposed to be different from the regular Barbie trope but idk- I felt A LOT of things. I still can't put it all into worlds and it's been 2 days now. I would love to hear if it affected anybody as deeply as me,2023-07-21
"I thought Gosling's performance in this was underwhelming, his role in The Nice Guys is one of the funniest performances I've ever seen in my life and constantly had me in tears, based on social media reactions I was expecting another role on that level from him but it mostly just had me exhaling out my nose harder than usual... A lot of the humour in the film overall just felt like ""Oh yeah I get it!"" internet reference type humour rather than genuinely hilarious shit. Idk anyway I thought it was a pretty decent film, 7-7.5/10 for me. Also the ending lowkey reminded me of End of Evangelion lol I thought it was pretty cool.",2023-07-21
"Absolutely spectacular.  We did a Barbie Oppenheimer double feature, and can't recommend it more.  Surprisingly, Barbie was the more thought provoking of the two.  I'm glad I avoided spoilers and whatever weird culture war was going on over this because I absolutely love sincere metamodernist works like Everything Everywhere All at Once and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.  I don't just want to hear people complaining about problems I already am well aware of and live through every day in my satirical entertainment.  I want to feel genuine and positive emotions, and understand that we could do better if we would simply choose to imagine it.

And imagination was really the core of this movie.  I felt like the point at the end was a little too spoon fed, particularly with the whole conversation with Ruth, and the male perspective was perhaps too subtle and glossed over (but yeah, it's a Barbie movie so okay).  I absolutely loved how they juxtaposed Barbieland as the result of female imagination with Reality as the result of male imagination, but I just wish there was more to drive home that point rather than Ruth flat out saying something along the lines of ""Whether it's Barbie or Patriarchy, it's all imaginary.""  If the movie had made that point more apparent, perhaps they wouldn't have had to come out and say it outright at the end.

Also, the comedy was on point.  When Ken arrived in the real world, it felt like an extended version of Taylor Swift's music video for The Man, and as a man there was a lot to relate to.  I loved the horse confusion, and the line, ""Once I found out patriarchy wasn't about horses, I kind of lost interest.""  In fact, as a man I really enjoyed a lot of the satire around the patriarchy because something that's often missed in discussions about it is the negative effects on men, and I think discussing that more would go a long ways to de-radicalizing a lot of the misogynist ""Men's Rights"" type reactionaries out there.  Will Ferrell's character and Ken's whole ""It's so hard being in charge!"" stuff was very on point.

I imagine it hit harder for a lot of women, though.  While I appreciated the satire of men's roles in a patriarchy, the movie focused more on women and a kind of Wakanda for women of what could be if more women were in positions of power.",2023-07-23
"Wow, some garbage takes in here. It‚Äôs a two hour fun party that gives you emotional and existencial scenes at the end. A sort of pinocchio, truman show vibes while also being just an overall celebration of womanhood but ALSO individuality and humanity. What‚Äôs not to like?",2023-07-21
"Good, but not that good of a movie. It tries too slather on the sentimentality but it lacks a core message or theme so instead just comes across as hollow. It's worth a single watch as a comedy but it's too incoherent to be considered a great movie.",2023-07-22
"So underwhelming and downright boring at times. Felt as tho the writers didn‚Äôt know who they were writing for. Ken ends up being more fun than Barbie, what?! Marketing said he‚Äôs just Ken‚Ä¶

The part that really ticked me off was Barbies plan to seduce and manipulate Ken. What is the messaging here for young girls? Toxic behavior gets you what you want? So irresponsible and just dumb, lazy writing. 

Lacked a compelling villain. Nope ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù does not cut it. I would‚Äôve enjoyed something that expanded on weird Barbie, possibly an evil Barbie for Ken to team up with and go head to head with stereotypical Barbie. Throw in a bunch of other toy minions too. But a woman versus woman conflict wouldn‚Äôt fit the agenda of this movie. 

You have to go 1000% on the absurdity factor with this type of film or it falls flat. It was so flat, I was itching to leave the theater.",2023-07-24
"I thought it was boring

It wasn‚Äôt a bad movie. The jokes were meh. The plot was confusing. The rules of the Barbieverse didn‚Äôt make much sense. And at first I thought, ‚Äúwell ok, maybe it‚Äôs just not for me,‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt seem like it was for children either. Maybe feminist-leaning women and/or persons, but even so.. it didn‚Äôt say or stand for anything I haven‚Äôt heard before. And it seemed to borrow a lot from the Lego movie‚Äîincluding Will Ferrel. I‚Äôve liked Greta Gerwig‚Äôs previous films, but this one just felt.. eh. Forgettable. 

Also, people dressing up for this film felt particularly cringe given they were paying to watch light-hearted corporate propaganda.",2023-07-28
"There are so many contradictory messages in the Barbie movie which tell you one message but show you another when it comes to men.

The movie has this attitude of ‚Äúfeminism knows what‚Äôs best for men and has their best interests at heart‚Äù, but also it contradicts itself and laughs at men for doing what the movies message says is alright and non toxic for men to do.

So for instance when Barbie cries it‚Äôs serious - when Ken cries it‚Äôs played for laughs - yet the movie is also trying to give us the message it‚Äôs alright for men to cry. 

The movie supposedly also tells us it‚Äôs alright for men to be who they really want to be and not have to play a role, yet the Kens expressing male interests is shown as a joke to be mocked.

In my opinion the movie is on the same level as some old movie which purports to have a good potrayal and message for black people - but shows them all as stereotypical, less intelligent and mocks their way of talking and living.

To me this is a movie made by bigots and enjoyed most by bigots who can‚Äôt see the problems inherent in it, or are able to excuse them for ideological reasons (like it‚Äôs alright to punch up on your ‚Äúoppressors‚Äù). And I think more people will see it that way in the future. 
Some people may like the fun aspects and casting and just the fact it‚Äôs live action Barbie and simply not consider those elements.",2023-08-07
**SUBLIME**,2023-07-21
"This movie was really good. The whole cast was great, but Ryan Gosling stole the show for me. Margot Robbie was such great casting for Barbie. The film really went beyond what you would expect and wove together a narrative about identity and finding your place in the world beyond what is foisted upon you due to your gender role. It really shows that everyone struggles with issues of identity because of the expectations that we all have to deal with.

Barbenheimer was such a fun time at the theater.",2023-07-21

Kate McKinnon who I usually find annoying in her roles was actually (to me) great. She wasn‚Äôt over the top and played that role right.    
    
The battle was perfect, I‚Äôve never seen my wife laugh that hard during a movie.

"It‚Äôs a meaningful movie for everyone who understands the concept of the movie but I don‚Äôt think this movie was for children. Personally it seemed more of a message to women out there which is understandably hard for kids to grasp, I generally thought this movie was just gonna be an IRL Barbie movie but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs super meaningful and very emotional.

And also this is a part of the realization that we are grown and that Barbie, who‚Äôs supposed to be this perfect woman who has a perfect life and all is shown to also struggle with insecurities and also go through these difficult situations humans go through. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for children, they are just simply not old enough to understand the concept of the movie, they shouldn‚Äôt be introduced to that big world yet, their still in their prime years and are still shielded from the world, which they should be.

And I mean kids as in 5-12 year olds.",2023-07-23
"I wanted more horses. And patriarchy!

It went from weird, to silly, to interesting, to weird again. And then the last 15-20 mins went completely over my head.

"Boring .. 2 out of 7 

Will not watch again.",2023-07-22
"Saw it last night and didn‚Äôt like the movie at all for various reasons. First the obvious, I felt it leant into misandry (perhaps more so than the director is aware she was doing) with its portrayal of all men as morons or morons who are doing something wrong. Now I know this being reddit some people will be angered by that, but I just watched Thelma and Louise which is about the most female empowerment movie there is, and men are also on the receiving end of a lot of negative portrayal in that - but I never got the feeling that that movie was anti man. In that random men who own diners or whatever aren‚Äôt just portrayed as stupid and to be mocked, there‚Äôs the Harvey Keitel character who isn‚Äôt just some dumb mean man etc 

In Barbie every Ken and real world man is a moron or a moron in the wrong. Even Gloria‚Äôs husband is randomly written as a goof who seems lame to his wife and daughter, despite him having nothing to do with the themes of sexism or men holding women down.

Second imo the writing is bad. Plot lines are started as though they‚Äôre important but never really fleshed out. Academic style language is used by characters it doesn‚Äôt fit as characters become interchangeable voice pieces for the themes and messages of the movie. 
Themes conflict with one another so messaging is lost - for example Ken is supposed to be both the patriarchy and the oppressed (like real world women when he‚Äôs in Barbie land) so it‚Äôs like is this guy meant to be bad for standing up to his oppressors? And the symbolism of him and the Kens representing real world women is watered down because they‚Äôre shown as goofballs who don‚Äôt really even want to be in charge.

Basically there are way too many themes being presented in a small space. I feel the movie would have been much stronger had they stuck to Barbies original existential/mid life crisis story line with a side of women empowerment and made the other themes short jokes.

Third the humour was off for me. There were some funnish parts and the weird Barbie was a nest idea, but overall I didn‚Äôt laugh much at all, actually in long stretches the movie wasn‚Äôt fun in the least imo. In my theatre most of the jokes didn‚Äôt seem to land but I‚Äôve also heard the opposite so obviously some people thought it was funny. There were a lot of obscure references that were slightly family guyish that didn‚Äôt work for me. Also that last Vagina joke? Lol seriously that‚Äôs the ending?

All in all the movie wasn‚Äôt that long but it sure felt long to me. Driving back from the palace I was worried my woman was going to say she loved it and want to talk about it but she thought it was kinda boring and just ok, so that was a relief. I can imagine this movie starting a lot of arguments between couples where the chick has gotten their man to go to the movie without him knowing much about it and thinking it will just be a fun romp like the ol Flinstones live action or something.",2023-08-01
"To the men upset about the way they were treated in this movie ‚Äî **why don‚Äôt you look at the way women are treated in the porn you watch every day**, before you come crying to me

 Amazing movie. Kate McKinnon was hilarious. Margot Robbie was perfect as Barbie! I cried,2023-07-25
"Watching the movie, I especially felt that the speech of barbie exists without a counterweight, leaving Ken (and therefore men) speechless. 
Therefore I decided to balance it out by giving Ken a voice as well. 
I imagined a conversation about unrealistic role expectations that Barbie could have had with Ken, just for both to find out that their struggles overlap significantly. 
Being convinced that due to acknowledging and better understanding each other, society can truly move forward. In the end, nobody is (or can be) perfect, since we‚Äôre all (just) humans‚Ä¶

I would appreciate feedback, since giving Ken a voice as an inexperienced video editor surely took some time&effort.

I feel that many points made in the movie has a backing for them in reality, but it was extremely over the top in almost every way, of course, because it‚Äôs a movie. A Barbie movie. If you actually think this movie is realistic in it‚Äôs entirety, then you probably shouldn‚Äôt be reviewing it.

"We both thought it was just OK. Once the novelty of Barbieland wore off, it felt pretty hollow and really dragged for us at the end.",2023-07-25
"The film could have gone in harder. I understand why it didn't, but, for example, Barbie could have used the word 'suicide' instead of 'dying' since that is the ideation that her real world counterpart was fixated on. America Ferrara's speech was wonderful and I don't disregard any of the micro aggressions and inequities she mentioned, but while we are talking about the patriarchy, we could talk about women being put in prison for having miscarriages or men being given lenient sentences because of what the 12-year-old was wearing that night. Greta Gerwig is a thoughtful artist and a savvy filmmaker, and she knows the lines she can't cross, but for people like Shapiro to whine about the film's message when it could have gone so much more for the jugular is snowflake-level.",2023-07-27
"This movie is overly theory crafted I swear. It is just a movie about two individuals having existential crisis where one is breaking from their pattern of complacency while the other is seeking their purpose in life. In the end, Barbie broke away from her utopic environment and embraced her humanity, while Ken stayed in Barbieland and acknowledged that his existence is not tied to another individual; that he is Ken-ough.

No, Barbieland and Kendom are not representatives of real life feminism and patriarchy else we would have seen a lot of gossiping, backstabbing, territorial disputes, and fighting over ""limited"" resources as we know that real humans will destroy each other given the chance. 

So what is the moral of the story? Definitely not ""patriarchy bad, feminism good"" because even Ken acknowledged that he did not fully understand patriarchy and Barbie chose to live in the patriarchy of the real world. At most, the lesson would be ""our system is broken, but it is a system"" and ""love your mother"".

Honestly, this is a very light movie with good visuals so stop with the over interpretation and just watch and enjoy",2023-08-07
"Just get out from the theater. I was so excited by this movie, I wear pink from toes to makeup. 

Never been that disappointed by a movie. 

The directing is mid. There is absolutely nothing astonishing. Production design was great for Barbieland tho and it‚Äôs the only good thing. 

There was a serious problem of rythm, the jokes felt flat because of it, the writing is Prometheus level of bad. 

Greta Gerwig being the first female director to hit the billion at the box-office is painful.

I never get the hype around her (her Little Women was atrocious) but even more now.

The film take itself wayyyyy too seriously for something that was supposed to be satirical and it‚Äôs the main problem. 

The mother daughter were useless. The character development basically inexistant or just ¬´¬†too on the nose¬†¬ª 

I love a good movie who call out the patriarchy, this one isn‚Äôt. Its painful it‚Äôs gonna be raise as a cult movie about feminism. And I‚Äôm really pissed to have the same feelings as incels, but feminism is way more than just misandrist boring message. It‚Äôs not offensive for men at all, it‚Äôs offensive for women. And the plot should be lead by the actions WITH a feminist message, not a plot leading by a message without being consistent. Storytelling don‚Äôt work that way. 

Moreover, where was the FUN ?! 

It‚Äôs painful that a light hearted comedy like Legally blonde which came out 20 years ago is a better feminist movie with a better writing, rythm, than a movie made by Oscars nominees (and I usually love what‚Äôs Noah Baumbach is doing) 

Good point : Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were really good. 

The last time I was this pissed when I left the theater was when I had to endure a Luc Besson movie for a date, (but at least you know that you are going to see shit) Yea that was fucking Luc Besson level of bad, sorry not sorry.",2023-08-13
"To preface, I was excited enough for the movie to attend a Thursday night preview with work the next day...

The movie started off with so much promise; set design and costuming was incredible, the musical sequences were fantastic, the cast was great, but halfway through it went way heavy-handed and preachy, then bounced around somewhat incoherently for a bit then concluded with one last retaliatory act against the Kens for the faults of the real world's exaggerated patriarchy. Had so much promise to be an all-time great, but ultimately beached itself.",2023-07-21
"Everyone is going to rightly talk about Ryan Gosling, but Jesus Christ, if Margot Robbie isn't one of our greatest living actors. 

She is good in everything and played an extremely layered character in a Barbie movie. She plays the vapid standard Barbie without delving into caricature and was able to sell all of the additional emotions. Barbie is unironically in my Top 5 performances of the year so far.",2023-07-21
"This film is borderline a masterpiece because it's just really clever. It never really talks down to it's audience and it is laugh out loud funny.

The film honestly feels like a headfuck though because it makes you question your position in the world. The cast was great, Robbie really showed her chops in parts of vulnerability that could be felt and Gosling was a powerhouse. Robbie is so likable as this character, she was honestly a delight.

The creative crew and Gerwig did an EXCEPTIONAL job, please look at the creative process it was a delight to watch. This is a movie that really understood its assignment flawlessly also the ending line was so on the nose but hilarious.",2023-07-21

I really wanted to like this. But it was hard work and by the end was willing it to end. The funniest moments were already (and there weren‚Äôt any others either‚Ä¶) in the trailer. I wasn‚Äôt entertained because it was just an exhausting mess of a movie.,2023-07-22

I was expecting raucous laughter to permeate most of this film but it never really came. The pacing was a bit off and the script was super weak at times, IMO, and that was made more apparent with a stacked cast who you all know can act. However, Gosling is one of my all-time favs and, like every other project, gives it 115% and elevates every moment. Just a complete star.",2023-07-22

"I may get down voted, but I did not enjoy the kens being played by the barbies around the campfire. Ken just wanted to be seen, but also emotional wreck Ken was too intense.",2023-07-23
"While the overwhelming majority of the comments are positive in Best (and for good reason), I do have to laugh at those of you criticizing the fucking Barbie movie of all movies for being too overtly feminist. Realistically even if the movies themes were more ""subtle"" you probably still would have taken issue at a woman's issues being in the spotlight, but still....what  the hell did you expect when the director is Greta Gurwig and once again the movie is about Barbie lol.",2023-07-26
"I watched it with my mother and my grandmother (a retired feminist professor) tonight. Frankly, it hit the right notes. I would say we all enjoyed the film. I'm trans nonbinary, so I died laughing the entire time and the end made me cry.  My mom thought it got a little too vapid with how they portrayed the Barbieland, but she liked the nostalgia of the various toys. My grandmother felt it dragged a little in the middle, but it tied the end up well. 

Usually one of us dislikes the movie we all see, so I'd give it a recommendation. I would say, you really gotta be willing to take a lot of camp and satire about gender roles. 

The movie is also very pink lol. The aesthetic was interesting and well executed. The actors all brought their A-game. Kate McKinnon absolutely nailed it.",2023-07-27
"I don't think the Barbie movie really broke any new ground. There was so much recycled material in a movie about plastic people, kind of on the nose.

In summary, this lack of originality felt boring.

I think every message they had to share with us was lifted from social media or from previous movies, almost like an AI generated the whole thing. It didn't feel like it had any soul, but it was definitely visually appealing with how colorful it was.",2023-08-02
"I came in without watching any trailers of this movie and the thought of a ""Barbie movie"" was stupid but after watching it, it felt so unserious and genius at the same time.

9/10",2023-07-22
"So after seeing it, I was hoping for more.


It has corporate apologia, and the ken issue I feel takes away from the movie. Ken is an incel, but he is also a stand in for women in the Barbie world which is already yikes. On the stand in side, the ken's take over, and everything goes downhill, so it's subtly pushing the idea that if women got power things wouldn't work out. On the incel side, the movie has Barbie apologize to ken, but I don't remember ken apologizing to Barbie for how he acted.


It says all the right things. It calls out the issues that women face. But it's all just words. It's a case of telling and now showing. Not dealing with. While the movie says the right words about being about women empowerment, what the movie is about is more focused around the programming and deprogramming of an incel. And that responsibility shouldn't be placed on women (Not that they can't chose to take it up, but it shouldn't be assumed that incels are their fault, or that they have to fix them).


It made promises at the start that it didn't keep. After the opening (and later when both the mother and the daughter give their rants) I wanted to see those issues explored instead of taking a backseat to some cishet blond white guy that can't accept a girl he thinks he likes not being into him. I wanted more 'Thank God I'm Pretty.' Why must women always take a back seat to men in movies?


And what's worse, it acknowledged the issues. But it had to do more that. It's a better movie than most others, but I think it still falls behind the likes of something like Everything Everywhere All At Once. And it hurts because of that opening promise. If it didn't have those moments, I probably would be less critical (though still unhappy about making CEOs just goofy instead of the sociopaths they are).


‚ÄãIt had some catchy songs though.",2023-07-23
"I did enjoy a bit of what this movie had to offer. It was very unique in a lot of ways and I was happy to give it a shot. It really seemed original. I just thought the movie was presented to me like an actual child. There really weren't any points in the movie where I felt like I heard something that hasn't already been said 100 times. I get that it's a kids movie so to them there might be something they'd never thought about or cared to think about. And America's monologs at the end was very cringey. It's not that I disagree with anything she says really, it's just that it could've been something so much more real. It just sounded like something corny moms in the 40s share on each other's FB Timeline...I know that's gonna get me down voted so hard but I really just expected more from this movie.",2023-07-26

"The comedy fell flat most of the time. Will Ferrell and the Matell guys especially.

I get what they wanted to do and it was a decent film but felt kind of rushed when they only spent like 30 minutes in the real world.

Gerwig got her feminism through but without the stereotypical ‚Äùgirlboss with an attitude‚Äù. It was done in a nice way and they even uplifted the Kens in a way.

Michael Cera had a smaller role than I expected.

Margot Robbie was good but man she is the prettiest person alive.

Ryan Gosling was easily the best part of the movie.",2023-07-22
"I found the movie very fun and funny. Had a great time, laughed my head off, was generally grinning for the whole flick. But the more I think about it, the more I believe that Barbie was extremely disappointing for its lack of any coherent message on gender politics, power structures, capitalism, corporate influence on body image... My problem is that the movie wasn't feminist ENOUGH. It checked a lot of boxes when making good jokes, but every time I tried to articulate the overarching argument of the film, it falls flat. There's no there there. Instead it leaves me wondering about Mattel's influence on the script and wary of the pinkwashing that the movie has succeeded in giving to this corporation.",2023-07-23
"It's insane that Mattel actually allowed their brand to be portrayed like this, the fact there's no women in their board of directors is a literal plot point and that the CEO makes a whole speech pathetically trying to explain it.... Like i was genuinely baffled when that scene played. This isn't a compliment or a criticism i'm just shocked.

About the movie itself... i'm sorry but it's such shallow feminism. ""Inequality bad, patriarchy bad, people stupid for creating them"". And it sucks because the entire movie revolves around it. I like the visuals, i like the actors (specially Ryan Gosling, i was one of the people who thought ""why tf him"" when they cast him as Ken but now i can't not see him as Ken), i even think some jokes were funny, but i can't really like the overall package cause it's based on an idea of feminism from a 17 year old twitter user. Like, the movie hammers it pretty hard that patriarchy is bad and shouldn't exiast, and it also makes it clear the 'system' under Barbieland is the same as patriarchy with the Barbies being the men and the Kens being the women, but at the same time it portrays the Kens destroying that system as bad? And the Barbies reinstating the barbiearchy as good? And even make a joke about the Kens not having a say in it?

The implication here is that the barbiearchy is either a good thing or a inevitable thing that you can't really change, and like??? Isn't that literally the opposite of the point of the movie??? This just shows how shallow the movie's messages are.

There's also other stuff like Barbie and Ken getting weird looks from people in LA, they're literally a pretty thin woman and a jacked dude if anything they'd be the ones giving weird looks, or basically any line from that woman's daughter, or the cringy monologue the woman gave... And that's disappointing, a theatrical Barbie movie that touches on the entirety of the Barbie history has so much potential, it's super disappointing how they decided to do it.",2023-07-23
I haven‚Äôt watched the movie so I‚Äôll just say this. There‚Äôs a YouTuber by the name of The Critical Drinker and he didn‚Äôt like the movie. You know when there are YouTubers upset about a movie that a majority of people love that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs a good movie,2023-07-23
"It was crazy to see all the guys discussing how bad the movie was. It seemed to really hit a nerve which means the movie worked lol 

I also thought it was cool that Barbie is an idea and this movie felt like a projection of that.",2023-07-24
"The only good thing about the movie was- Ken?

I was really excited to see how Greta Gerwig, one of my favourite directors and writers, would tackle the concept of a live action movie. I absolutely loved her interpretation of the little women and lady bird is a gem of a movie (highly recommend). Since my expectations from the movie were so high, I came out of the theaters very disappointed. Here's why.

Overall the movie felt like someone had an idea of turning barbie into a live action movie and all the interesting details one can put into it. My problem really is that the writers couldn't come up with a cohesive plot to back the concept. The movie starts with a barbie world ruled by barbies, with Kens having no say at all. I think it's supposed to be something that contrasts the real world. We can clearly see the Kens struggling with their identities and purpose. However, instead of showing their struggle as a real issue, it is often used as a gag or a plot point that is supposed to show that the women are empowered or 'in-charge'. Ryan Gosling's Ken realizing that men rule the real world was not used as a motivation but a villain arc. Even by the end, the Kens' self realization was glossed over or used as a gag. They were pit against each other and the women used that to gain back the rule instead of coming to a mutual decision. How is this any different than patriarchy and I think this goes against the concept of feminism. Even at the end, the Kens were given token jobs in the cabinet. 

My other minor issues arise with the story. Firstly, Will Farrell's character was completely wasted. What was built up as a villain, ended up being another gag by the end. Every male character in the movie was shown to be dumb. That's not how the real world is. History has shown that people who have made an active effort to suppress women are not ""dumb"". They are shrewd but clever. Patriarchy and power has been institutionalized to an extent that they use all their wits and efforts to suppress women. I hate the fact that barbie had to do nothing clever in order to escape the people at Mattel.

Secondly, America Fererra's character's rant and support for Barbie wasn't developed well. One may argue her connection to Barbie was still someone explained, I would not go as far as to say it was developed but we got an explanation but her rant to de-brainwash the barbies came out of nowhere. There was one incident showed at the office. Her major character point was feeling disconnected with her daughter which did not tie into her rant at all. We weren't shown enough to experience her frustration. This led me to think that by the end the movie became more performative than feminist. 

Also, Alan, the only androgynous character who I think is supposed to be not straight but I'm not sure I apologize if I'm wrong but even if he were straight, doesn't fit into the stereotypical divide of man and woman is never given any respect, even till the very end like wtf this is not feminism.

Overall, the movie did not end up being cohesive, there was more tell than show and besides simu liu's and Ryan gosling's Ken, other characters who were played by big names, weren't campy and over the top enough. I have so much more to rant but I'm going to stop here.

Edit: I have a lot of points that I keep on adding because the more I think about it, the madder I get lol",2023-07-24
"The movie was entertaining and funny, but the story and message was pretty bland. The main Ken was treated like a prop while living in Barbieland and gets his only validation from Barbie, his frustration were valid. There didn't seem to be a place for Kens in Barbieland other than to be accessories to their respective Barbies. Then Kens and the patriarchy became the antagonists of the story, rather than the unfair treatment of genders in both Barbieland and the real world.

My main problem with the movie was honestly the plot. The comedy was great, but the plot was just eh. It would have been better if the main Barbie decided she wanted to become human and Gloria wanted to become Barbie. Since if Barbie were human she'd be able to change and grow like a human in the real world, and Gloria were a barbie than she could live in a fantasy world where life is easy and fun.

Edit: The resolution could have been if things were changed around. Barbie could become a human in the real world, Gloria and Ken could live in Barbieland and enact change to make it so Barbies and Kens are treated equally. Since Barbieland isn't such a great fantasy for men/Kens.",2023-07-25
"I was kind of disappointed with the movie, and it really isn't the movie's fault. It presents its core message well. I kinda knew it was going to be a feminist movie, but I didn't think it was going to be the entire theme. I came in expecting some movie about barbie escaping into the real world, getting sentience and forming a global scale rebellion or something. Again, that's kinda my fault for building up false expectations.

Halfway through, I could already tell how the movie was going to end and I didn't really want to hear  it preach to me about a topic that I'm very well aware of have heard a thousand times.",2023-07-22
"Fucking terrible ending made this a 5/10.

Hollywood‚Äôs extreme aversion to ‚Äúguy gets girl‚Äù basically ruined this movie. Ken was showing Barbie how much it sucks to be in the position he was in, they should have come to an understanding and finally kissed, and shared the dreamhouse. Would that have been so wrong? Maybe give Ken an actual fucking job instead of just ‚Äúbeach‚Äù?

Instead Ken comes to a random epiphany that‚Äôs he‚Äôs ‚Äúkenough‚Äù and goes right back to being a homeless, loveless beach bum (even more loveless now that now his Barbie has fuckin LEFT Barbie world so he doesn‚Äôt even have a Barbie‚Ä¶just realized that). 

Barbie decides to go to the real world because now she‚Äôs too awakened to just live in Barbie world I guess‚Ä¶and she magically gets a vagina. Cool. Whatever. I mean we established that men are evil and Barbie shows zero interest in them so what the hell is she supposed to do with it? Also shouldn‚Äôf we see her thriving a little more in the real world? Maybe get a job as a motivational speaker or something? She seems to want to help women and yet her ending is just ‚Äúhey got my vagina whoopie‚Äù instead of something more constructive and meaningful.

Also the fear of death was never addressed. Like she had it, and it got her out of Barbie world, but now why does she not have it anymore? Like that was never resolved. In fact now that she went from being an idea to a real person shouldn‚Äôt the fear of death be stronger than ever? As an idea she was nearly immortal because for her to die literally everyone in the world would have to forget about Barbie, which could take thousands of years. As a real person she‚Äôs gunna be dead in like 40-50 years. So shouldn‚Äôt she be MORE worried about death now? This movie has like 1,000 loose ends.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just Ken‚Äù was an absolute banger though. Justifies the movie‚Äôs entire existence just so we could get that one song.",2023-07-26
"Does anyone else feel like the movie was just a big attempt by Mattel to say ‚Äúhey everyone, don‚Äôt think about all the talk about whether Barbie promoted bad body image, look over there, aren‚Äôt men awful?‚Äù
And they just suckered Gerwig and all the rest into playing a sleight of hand on the toy buying public and have now positioned Barbie as this figure of womens rights?

Now say Mattel 100 times and buy a Barbie",2023-07-25
Just left the theatre and honestly didn‚Äôt love it. I‚Äôm 100% a feminist and am a female in a male dominated academic field but I just found the movie to be too ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and almost trying too hard? It wasn‚Äôt light hearted and fun like I had hoped. Definitely some funny moments but overall I just thought it was too much and the narrative was a bit extreme. Great screenplay though and super cool to see. I just wish the theme was more about Barbie and not about Barbie is better than Ken. Just my thoughts!,2023-07-27
"The more I think about the movie the more the narrative makes absolutely no sense. So supposedly the America Ferrara character is playing with Barbie and that is making Barbie sad, but this is never really followed up on. Like why if that is the way Barbie is made sad can‚Äôt America Ferrara just fix the Barbie and Ken fight and make their Barbie world better, given that it‚Äôs been established that what she does in the real world effects Barbie land?


I know some people will say I‚Äôm thinking about it too much but even a goofy fantasy movie has to have some sense of logic and continuity, there are so many things in this movie that make absolutely no sense story wise. Yet they‚Äôre overlooked because the movie had a message for women that‚Äôs a satire or something. I get that - but shouldn‚Äôt the actual plot make some sense?

Seems like the writers were so into the message and satire of the movie they forget to have the plot make any semblance of sense. Also so many themes are brought up as though they‚Äôre gonna be super serious then just never followed up on at all.",2023-07-27
"Fun movie, the music, the humour, the vibe and directing were contagious. 



Kinda feel like it became too self righteous with the message and the final stretch of the movie lost track of itself. Like, it was trying to focus on all the issues women face today, and I mean ALL, speaking on a global level. And that kinda does a disservice to itself, since it simples the situation. The issues women face depend heavily on the area of the globe you are. Like a woman in North America has too worry about expectations from society and beauty standards, while someone from the middle east has to worry about legal rape and execution. 




I like the ambition, maybe focus on only one category? 





Barbie was a giant bitch at times and feels like she didn't have much growth by the end. I mean she's stereotypical Barbie at the beginning...but it doesn't feel like she became anything more by the end.",2023-07-30
"Why I didn't like the Barbie movie - a feminist view

So to start off with, I want to make it absolutely clear I am a feminist. A proud one. If you're here to hate on the feminist messages that the Barbie movie is attempting to make, you're in the wrong place. 

I just wanted to share my feelings and see if I'm alone in this? I am a feminist. I didn't like the Barbie movie. I feel a bit called out by people constantly saying you're anti-feminist or this movie isn't for you if you didn't like it (I'm a woman). 

So first I'll say what I did like, then I'll go on to the reasons I didn't like the movie.

I did like the feminist tone in as far as America Ferrara's character doing the monologue on the struggles of the modern woman. This is needed. And it needs to be repeated until it's heard. I'm just not sure this movie was the avenue for it for reasons I'll get into. I also liked the set design, costume design, casting, diversity. I liked weird Barbie and the idea that Ken discovered the patriarchy. I liked that Barbie didn't need a man to make her happy. There's a lot of good in this. 

So now, what I didn't like:

1. This feels to me very much like Mattel trying to rewrite the Barbie narrative to sell more capitalistic shit. They lean heavily into the ""Barbie has always been so feminist, she was an astronaut when women couldn't have credit cards"" angle. 

Which may be true. But it's not the whole truth. Barbie was also a major contributor to body image issues. She was only white and thin and blonde for so long (until they realised money could be made from change). 

Barbie only also promotes one way to be a woman. Hyper feminine, positive, everything's a pleasure, no trouble at all. 

Barbie's dream house and car etc now being reframed as independence are really just ways to sell more stuff. It's just capitalism. It's just branding. Why didn't they lean into Barbie bring a feminist earlier if she always was? 

Truth is, they realised dream houses would sell so they made dream houses. 

Also didn't Ruth Handler invent Barbie with her husband? Why are they not mentioning that? 

I feel like this is just a poor attempt from Mattel to get in front of the game before people start accusing them of being anti-woman and rewriting history. Am I alone in this?

2. The story line was piss poor and made no real sense. It had no structure and you had no idea where it was going half the time. The daze the Barbies went into and how they came out made no sense. How did they get brainwashed?? 

3. While it goes on about how feminist it is two bits really stood out to me as being problematic. The first is in the fact that the thing that compels Barbie to go to the real world and save the girl (that's who she thought at the time) wasn't any of the issues women face in the real world. It was cause she wanted to fix her cellulite. 

The scene where stereotypical Barbie has a break down when she comes back to Barbie land and she's upset because she doesn't feel important or attractive. It's almost made to be like this moment that every woman is able to relate to. The expectation to be everything, to be too much, to never be enough. But then they fuck it up with a voiceover which is like ""note to film makers, Margot Robbie was not the right casting choice if you wanted to make that point"" after she says she feels ugly ....

Umm how did no one on this set realise how that is going against the grain that everything that scene was trying to achieve? 

Like we all struggle with body image, but you shouldn't if you're thin and blonde like Margot Robbie? Was that meant to be relatable? 

4. I really hated the 'self aware' Mattel shenanigans.  So disingenuous. 

What does everyone else think?",2023-07-31
"**The Good:**

The costume and Set designs were amazing

Ryan Gosling KILLED it

There were admittedly some funny parts that made me laugh out loud, namely the ""Beach Off argument""


**The Bad:**

The Real World section of the movie was just cheesy

What was actually the point of Will Ferrell's character?

The scene when all the Ken's are playing for the barbie's was a fantastic scene and it was ruined by Barbie


**The Ugly:**

What was the plot supposed to be? It was fixing barbie, then it was destroying the patriarchy, then it was being human and finding yourself?

At the risk of sounding like an incel, they could've built women up instead of tearing men down. The message I got was, ""It's ok for people to be oppressed as long as women are in charge.""

If I had a nickel for everytime they said ""patriarchy,"" I could refund my ticket and buy myself some popcorn

*2/5*",2023-08-02
"Maybe I went there with high expectations (everyone who‚Äôd seen it was raving about it).

I thought it went on about the whole patriarchy thing for way too long; you kind of get it soon and want to move onto something else as it gets tiring.

I didn‚Äôt like the way ‚Äúwhat men are supposed to be like‚Äù get portrayed lately (not just in this movie). They appear goofy, bit dim, completely emasculated etc. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a middle ground. It‚Äôs just too extreme. I just don‚Äôt think this kind of thing does the sex ‚Äúdiscrepancies‚Äù much justice.

I thought that towards the end they‚Äôll even things out a bit and bring the sexes together.

Oh and the beach scene towards the end just made women look deviously manipulative and unreasonably cruel. 

I think there‚Äôs a real risk it‚Äôll achieve the opposite effect of what it was trying to do (bringing both sexes together). 

All in all it was kind of childish, primitive, one sided and missed the mark somehow. But I get why it ‚Äúculturally necessary‚Äù right now.

The first quarter was quite funny though.",2023-08-05
"I think they simplified Ken‚Äôs potential to grow in the movie by having his goal in life in the beginning be ‚Äúfor Barbie to look at him‚Äù. I think if they changed that to ‚ÄúKen worked out everyday, acted macho, had a high powered job to impress Barbie‚Äù (all things the patriarchy emphasises men must do and be to ‚Äòget women‚Äô) then the arc at the end could‚Äôve been much deeper.

In the end, he only had one way to go, then, which was ‚ÄúI can be myself without Barbie‚Äù, but I wanted him to change into: ‚ÄúI can cry, I can be vulnerable, who cares about abs, I can do what I really love which is painting or whatever‚Äù. This would‚Äôve hit harder on why the patriarchy also hurts men. They did a great job hitting on why it hurts women but I wish it had that extra layer. That would‚Äôve made it more deep for me. 

The Ken arc and ending was a miss for me to explore another aspect of patriarchy.",2023-07-21
I don't understand how this is rated so highly. It's an average movie,2023-07-22
"I will preface this by saying that I am a guy and I chose to watch this movie by myself because I was that excited to see it. I‚Äôve never played with Barbies, dolls, or any sort of action figures. This wasn‚Äôt a toy movie for me, just a regular movie. If you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the target demographic for this movie, shame on you. I don‚Äôt see movies as gendered, and if you do, I‚Äôm sorry you limit yourself like that. 

I‚Äôm mixed. The comedy and plot were generally great, and everyone gave good performances (weirdly it was Ryan Gosling who stood out), the directing, set pieces, music choices, all of it good, but I did not like the themes.

This movie is rated PG 13, but a lot of kids with their parents came to see it, and I feel like they‚Äôre going to walk away from the theatre with some wrong ideas. This movie kind of presented the idea of Barbieland, aka a matriarchy, being so much better than the real world, a patriarchy. They‚Äôre both bad things. The movie took on an adult theme and problem, but gave a very childish view of it. The Barbies seriously were that engrossed with the patriarchy they needed a rousing speech and social media feminism to make them snap out of it? What the hell? 

In Barbieland they presented both the matriarchy and the patriarchy as this good thing as long as the ‚Äúunderclass‚Äù don‚Äôt realize that there‚Äôs another option. In the real world we know about these issues. It doesn‚Äôt take an awakening to realize that certain groups have more power, and there is no blissful ignorance. Being the wrong crowd means you get hurt. 

And the ending pretty much reverted Barbieland (an idea of a better society) back to where it was? Oh, one Ken will have an important position from time to time, and maybe some small amount of improvement in the future. I do realize that the real world is heavily favored with men in power. The Mattel chairman characters more subtly presented that idea better than any other part of the movie.

Ultimately, I think this movie presented themes creeping towards toxic femininity. Take the example of the dad, a gringo unable to go outside, thus causing the mother to be deeply unhappy. That idea is so sexist. A man has an issue, and because of that the woman is in anguish. Do women not have agency and control to determine their own well being? Also that dad was practicing Spanish on his own to better connect with his Latina family and they gave him some shit for it, which I don‚Äôt appreciate. They also blamed a lot of problems on men that women perpetuate. Women physical beauty standards are almost entirely dictated by other women, even shown in the film. Not once did a single male character (as far as I can remember, could be wrong) comment about the way a woman looked, outside of those very in your face construction workers and beach goers. The Barbies and other women constantly commented about each other‚Äôs appearances, and even isolated Kate McKinnon‚Äôs Barbie and called her ugly/weird several times. You can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too.

All this to say, I did enjoy the movie, but I have to separate some of the themes with the rest of the film. Definitely rewatchable, and I may change my opinion about it, who knows.",2023-07-23
"I don't know how anyone can have any like political/ideological takes on this movie given it's a mess that doesn't know what it wants to be. It'd be like debating 5 or 6 loose concepts just tossed together in a salad bowl in a way that's sometimes conflicting. Not even in a ""afraid to really commit"" way like I assumed the reviewers were talking about, because if you're easily put in upset over this stuff, you're still likely to get upset, but it's more like it just says a whole lot and all that you can say is ""haha, fun-ee michael cera"". And then main barbie's story line in specific seemed very vaguely related to all of that in a way where i'm sure they're hoping analysts can cover for them. like if you took a kid to this movie, i don't even think they'd walk away with *any* message good or bad.

Fun film though, great humor from start to finish.",2023-07-23
"Margot Robbie was the saving grace. Her performance made the movie watchable. Every other aspect just felt half baked. The first 20 minutes set up a really compelling experience. My boyfriend even said, ‚ÄúWhat if the bus stop woman is who Barbie was sent there for?‚Äù. I think that would have been more interesting than what we got.",2023-07-23

"My wife and daughter (15) went to this last night. Both didn't like it and found the ending depressing. Wife told me it's not fun, not funny, VERY preachy and not a kids film. Both enjoyed first half hour. I'm curious as to who the target audience is for this film. It certainly doesn't seem to be little kids who like to play happy fun games with Barbie and ken. There is a reason why the transformers and Lego films were so successful. They are fun kids films based on a kids toy franchise for kids and with a few jokes for the parents. That's what I presumed Barbie film would be. Obviously not.

Edit. I personally have no problems with this film, I didn't see it as it doesn't sound like my thing. Visuals look great. I'm just posting this as alot of women I work with are planning on bringing their daughters to it and are expecting a very different kind of film to what my wife described. They are expecting a breezy campy easygoing ""enchanted"" type film for the kids. Thats all folks, not a bot",2023-07-22
"While I'm not the target audience for this movie, I did watch it because I love the cast and crew, but found it pretty cringe

I do not have a single problem with the politics of the movie, I just didn't think any of the jokes landed

Also what's up with the ending? Why is she visiting a gyno?",2023-07-22
"So bit of a pretentious knob starting statement, but I‚Äôm a film student, I‚Äôm a bloke, and I‚Äôve written about female agency in films previously (by choice). I focused on how it‚Äôs neglected in certain films and Hollywood in general with close analysis. I watched this with my girlfriend, and I would class my politics as centre left.

I would give Barbie an 8-9/10 for the current climate of boxoffice releases. It‚Äôs as close a thing to a classic as there‚Äôs ever been in the past few years, and the aesthetic choices, choreography etc were all memorable. It does lose some of its semblance in its monologues, but it mostly holds up because it uses those monologues to create more jokes, with biting commentary that makes sense. 

However, as others have pointed out, there are contradictions in its messaging. 

I think the viewpoints that have been expressed by the American right wing are bullshit, but they do have a point that it‚Äôs not exactly a film that comes with a wholly positive message about men even though obviously we go into this knowing it‚Äôs a film primarily directed towards women. On the one level I get the joke about Ken being superfluous, and I understand that it may be purposefully targeting patriarchy because we do still need to remain vigilant of extremism and oppression, especially right now with culture wars etc. But in terms of what it actually does to address the culture wars, it‚Äôs definitely a film that‚Äôs happier to stoke the flames. There were three moments where I thought well maybe they‚Äôll resolve it, but it did not, and so I assume the point was not to resolve it and to spread the message that we need to be separate people, discover ourselves, blah blah blah. But that‚Äôs where it loses me. Like the stereotypical male stuff in the film was really funny, the interests applied to me pretty frickin‚Äô well. But I see more likelihood that the internet will start referring to people as ‚Äòa Ken‚Äô to describe a sort of basic guy, rather than take a message of let people be themselves. Maybe Ken itself is a commentary on the way people define women as basic bitches etc etc, but that feels pretty weak to me, and tenuous at best. The Kens had genuine interest in subjects, they were excited to share things with Barbies, and they were continually told they didn‚Äôt know who they were or what they wanted OR they were belittled for it. 

Ken being rejected as a partner is fine. But I think the message of Ken discovering things he likes and then being told to find himself is massively conflicting. He was rejected as a person. Is that the point? Like they were mostly pretty banal, ordinary, funny things barring the patriarchy (which he only liked because of horses anyway). It‚Äôs not the type of stuff men have to be indoctrinated into liking as if those things solely belong to a frat kid or Andrew Tate or Joe Rogan, which to me was how it was presented. I think in that instance the comedy just doesn‚Äôt work with the undertones. The comedy part was funny and worked as a standalone, but the undertones of the Barbies invalidated the men having interests. Like again, is that the point? 

The Barbies also intentionally made the Kens jealous to make them fight each other, and I think it‚Äôs fine for media like film to express and show a particular perspective in general, but with a film this big I found it slightly morally questionable because it was treated as justifiable. It was pretty toxic behaviour - most people would not respond well to it, but it‚Äôs justified because dismantling male structures??? Like, again, the comedy and the undertone just don‚Äôt mix well. I like the joke but the undertone felt wrong enough that my girlfriend was the first person to mention it afterwards. 

What stood out the most was the ‚Äòyou have to be x and you have to be y‚Äô speech compared to attitudes about the Kens. However, ironically, despite it standing out, a few hours later I can‚Äôt remember the speech so I can‚Äôt think of any solid examples now. 

It just seems a bit out of touch that a film so intent on individualism, expression, identity and humanity doesn‚Äôt fully reconcile that men have similar issues. I think it tried to partially, but it didn‚Äôt feel complete, and all it needed was a slightly more unified statement at the end. It was a clear this is our territory and we‚Äôre claiming it as women thing, but I think me and my girlfriend felt a bit alienated because we look at each other as people/individuals already, above just being men and women. And one of the speeches at the end, about a woman being free to be/do whatever she wants, felt a bit redundant and ham fisted given that it‚Äôs the sentiment expressed by Barbies in the beginning. I just don‚Äôt really know what it was trying to accomplish. To me it just reinforced a gender division. I grew up around feminists and division was not the kind of viewpoint that was expressed to me. Equity was. This film felt like it was Malcom X rather than Martin Luther King, not wholly aggressive, validly hostile, but perhaps anti integration in a way that I think most people don‚Äôt agree with.

Tl;Dr

Great film, but just like the character Barbie, the movie doesn‚Äôt know what it wants

The movie wasn‚Äôt made for me but it was decent. My girlfriend loved it as she grew up with Barbie so she was really happy. To me there were a few good moments mainly revolving around Ken and what they do with him.  Its biggest miss was it got way to preachy at times and even though I agree with the message it was presented so horribly that it took away from the movie.,2023-07-23

"The movie was quite good. Some parts hit me and did get a couple tears out of me. I wish the movie would've expanded more on the mother and daughter's relationship and the Ken storyline though. I lowkey wanted to see things go back to normal and Barbie could see how badly they treated the Kens and then they would spend more time on the topic in order to really sell the equality message.

"When this movie was first announced to be happening I thought it was a really dumb idea. However once Greta Gerwig attached herself to this and Margot Robbie was casted I became intrigued. This is probably the most pleasantly surprised I‚Äôve been after seeing a movie since The Lego Movie In 2014 I guess all the hype online surrounding this turned out to be worth it. 

Now that‚Äôs not to say this is a perfect movie, it‚Äôs not. The first act for me dragged and the movie only started to get good for me once Barbie and Ken entered the real world. The performances here were great across the board. Margot Robbie fits into this role like a glove like seriously I can‚Äôt picture any other actress doing this role as good as she did here. I find it funny that now whenever people think of Margot Robbie the first two things that come to mind for probably most people are now Harley Quinn and Barbie. Ryan Gosling who is one of my favorite actors is also really good here so much so that he arguably steals this movie away from Robbie at times. If you watched Crazy Stupid Love and The Nice Guys you would know that Gosling has great comedic chops and they are on full display here. Will Ferrell essentially has the same role here as he did in The Lego Movie but if I‚Äôm being honest I thought Phil Lord and Chris Miller were able to use him better in that compared to what Gerwig did with him here. Also shoutout to Michael Cera who had a small but effective role here. 

Greta Gerwig herself is now 3/3 with Lady Bird, Little Women and now this. Hopefully she‚Äôs able to keep her winning streak going. With the way this movie ends I‚Äôm not sure how a sequel would work exactly. However what I do hope happens is we get a Ken spin-off movie after the likely success of this and honestly how could we not. I am Kenough.",2023-07-22

"Wow I'm so pleasantly surprised with this movie. I had no expectations going in because I haven't seen any trailers and they really knocked it out of the park. I haven't laughed this much in a movie in awhile, but I'm even more impressed about how profound they were able to make it with realizing that you don't have to be subjugated to any labels. The timing is funny because that lesson I only started really internalizing myself and I think I was able to have a deeper appreciation being on the other side of it already.",2023-07-23

"Amazing movie and I was really touched by it. A lot of people are saying that ""of course patriarchy is bad and that's just obvious and preachy"", but I gotta be honest... I feel like it HAD to say it so bluntly because people who ignore this stuff just would gloss over and say ""you're just seeing things"" like a lot of them constantly do. I also enjoy the fact that it was a movie geared toward women and poked fun at men in the same way their movies make fun of us (Synder cut joke, Godfather joke, etc.). I also loved that Barbie didn't get together with Ken and all Kens finally accepted they just wanted to be friends with Barbies!

"I have to see it as fun and campy romp. Margo had some good beats and Ryan stole the show but the larger plot and the themes felt rather uninspired and lazy. Feels like the same kind of white woman feminism you see on Twitter (or saw on Tumblr back in the day) nowadays. All in all, still fine, but I feel like if you're seeing this film and viewing the finale as some grand feminist outcome then I really doubt we have the same view of a feminist end game. As a fun and campy romp touching on gender issues but not committing to exploring them with the depth needed? 8/10. As a subversive satire of gender norms and some grand piece of feminist art? 5/10. 

.

I really feel that they just tried to address too much and this sacrificed the nuances needed to actually have this be something worthy of great feminist praise in 2023 yaknow? What I'm really not a fan of is all the people who love it, but are unable to recognize any criticism of it. Who treat any discomfort at the choice of having all the men be either idiots or idiots/shitheads, as proof they're some Jordan Peterson fanboy. Frankly I have to thank it, because it will be a good litmus test going forward to determine if someone has what I see as a toxic view of feminism. Similar to guys and their view of fight club and how it handled masculinity.


.

Edit; I do want to absolutely sing the praises again of Margo, Ryan, the set designs, and the music. I get what they were trying to go for as a whole, and while I think they only really nailed Ken's story, I feel it just missed the mark thematically. I said elsewhere, it rightfully criticizes toxic masculinity but paints masculinity as performative without bothering to show examples of positive masculinity. As well as seemingly justifying the sexist ways women have been treated in society by saying ""eh maybe eventually you'll get equality but for now just take what we give you and shut up"". All in all... Maybe I was just expecting too much, but considering how amazing Greta is as a filmmaker I really don't think I was.",2023-07-22
"Might be in the minority but didn‚Äôt care for this movie at all. Margot Robbie needs an Oscar nomination at least because her performance was the best part of the film. Wasn‚Äôt really big on the overall script and plot. The dancing scene at the end and the Ken‚Äôs fighting just became a drag. Having a himbo character is always fun but that got over done too that it just stopped being funny. Not much development, besides the real world sucking, but then Barbie liking that, then the last joke to close the film really took away from whatever message they were trying to hammer in.
Some jokes I laughed, but a lot were misses. Maybe because I‚Äôm quite young my humor didn‚Äôt click with more millennial humor? I don‚Äôt think this film is gonna age well by the end of the year or a year after like other movies that had strong hype only to be disliked later on. I don‚Äôt mind camp films but I found The Greatest Showman campy but well done camp.",2023-08-07

Movie was overhyped. Better messaging could‚Äôve been portrayed and there were too many slow parts imo,2023-07-30
"I haven't been this confused since watching a movie since another Will Ferrell movie - Anchorman 2.

Questions I asked myself included general ""what is the message of this movie"" to ""did Barbie undergo any actual development?"" The movie sort of shows us these as well, Barbie is credited in-movie for things she says she never did. A movie where Barbie-world Barbie teaches real life Owner and Daughter to reconcile through her naive but empowered worldview would have a message to it. Multiple interpretations. But we didn't get that movie. A movie where real-world Evil Mattel tries to put Barbie ""back in the box"" as a metaphor for oppression would have very simple messaging, but we didn't get that movie. At every turn where this movie had a chance at messaging it replaced that chance with another joke. The messaging at the end, where Carla tells Barbie that Barbie's role is to continue changing and evolving and to continue to inspire women, and then she's like ""nah I'm good"". Barbie shows up in the real world and her first shown experience as a real woman is... that women have to go to gynecologists? It's a funny shocking joke - but what's the meaning? I'd say there is no meaning, but if you look for a meaning it's not a positive and inspiring one for women. 

Barbie's taking over Barbieland was rather shallow on the Barbie end. It's a movie where the Kens do the heavy lifting. And the character exploring. And the character growth. And I could see Barbie getting at the very least a nomination for Best Original Song. It might win it too! The song is that good and as far as anything pivotal in this movie goes it's the crux. But this is Barbie - so why are men at the focus?? Why is this movie carried by men? Barbie also happens to cry a lot. Sure - crying shows her having emotions instead of being a plastic doll. But crying? What's that say about women? Near the end she's constantly crying. And once again at the end Ken is the one who knows who he is - an extension of Barbie. And he emotionally struggles to change, with an emotional breakthrough. It's done much better than Barbie going to Heaven with a Ghost, crying, and not having a breakthrough. 

I don't know what to think. It felt a lot like Anchorman 2. That movie also had a chance to find a direction or make a point it pivoted to a joke. And it feels strange that a Barbie movie is so heavily carried by Gosling, Liu, and Ben-Adir. The Barbie's sneaky plan - and you know I love a heist movie - is also heavy on the male acting. The messaging of the movie is at odds with its own production.

I don't know what to think of it. The deprogramming by listing ways in which the world is unfair to women was something, but I don't think it went anywhere or did anything to resolve the issue. Or to even address it. And it's super strange to me that we found conflict and resolution in Barbie world - it's a movie that has no grounded experience for us as viewers. It's like when the Guardians of the Galaxy saved that random thing. Okay? I'm very well tired of ""save the world"" movies, but at least save our world people. Obviously it'd ring hollow if Barbie saved Earth from the patriarchy - as hollow as when Black Panther invested in inner cities and then Disney did jack shit to help inner cities in the real world - but it'd at least have some kind of message for Earth. 

I don't know. This is my rant. Time to read what everyone else wrote!

"This was such a weird, disjointed movie‚Ä¶little to no character development or actual substance. And I was really hoping that it would be a total female empowerment movie but somehow it was more the Ken show.

"Transgressive masterpiece. Though IMO fell just short of being called ""masterpiece"". Walked an extremely fine line between genuine sentimentality and cringe, and every time they veered into the ""cringe"" they looped it around and integrated it perfectly into the movie. I hope it makes the biggest losers on the planet moan like the children they are. Hilarious, philisophical, avante-garde, weird, emotional. Such a fantastic flick. Not in a rush to see it again but there are so many moments of brilliance. 

The opening 20 minutes or so (until barbie starts her real world adventure) is truly inspired. I love the bumbling mattel execs. Feels like a response to the Lego Movie in many ways (obviously). Just a grand grand time at the movies. Heartbreak feels good in a place lile this.

"While I found it funny and enjoyable. I didn't love it. Barbieland is a reverse world where Kens might not hold much power. It felt all men vs women thing, what about the Kens who might be in touch with their feminine sides? At this day and age, where trans and gender identity is a big deal, is whole men vs women thing even important? 

If you throw out patriarchy and make the society lean towards matriarchy, you are basically doing same thing, just reversing the roles. What about equal representation, in parliament, everywhere? We love playing with Ken as much as we love Barbie. There are just more Barbies so we didn't have much choice in Ken.",2023-07-22

Ken needing Barbie's approval to validate himself is relatable and hilarious. Him discovering patriarchy and all the other Kens mansplaining things were so on point (except for the photoshop part. Idk why that should be considered mansplaining), and America's monologue was powerful.

"Aside from the visuals and some good jokes in there I didn't find it that entertaining. All of the characters are unlikeable. We can't feel sorry for Margot's pity party, The Kens war and songs go on too long, as does the Ruth Handler scene. Margot Robbie telling us she's no longer perfect now she has flat feet and cellulite really doesn't make the point the wanted it to make, even with the 4th wall break with narration gag, it still didn't land how I think they wanted it to. America's mono about the impossible task of being a perfect woman was great but used pretty mediocre examples and missed a great opportunity. Sasha's emotions throughout are at the whim of whatever point the writer is trying to make and don't follow the logic of actual human being. Gosling's character is really unlikeable, in a bad way. The hype of this movie and the marketing made me look forward to seeing Gosling as Ken only to extremely let me down. Not enough Barbieland or really any geography explored. Will Farrell and Co, are they good guys? Bad guys? I feel like they were meant to be bad but because they represent Mattel it was like, let's make them ridiculous to gloss over the fact they are also bad. What do you mean barbie doesn't need permission to be a human? Who are all these people in this randomly long drawn out flashback/flashforward? Allan's character was just massive wasted potential for someone interesting, they almost got there with him and then gave up, he was just a gag in the end.

Then there's the political messaging, which was the lowest on my list of complaints before anyone comes at me. Any time you may be starting to enjoy the movie, a soapbox moment appears and it's like you're watching a required training video rather than a movie which is supposed to entertain. Good storytelling is done through the story, this film has so much exposition it's insulting the intelligence of everyone who watches it.

Contrary to the many expectations set on women, I didn't need the Barbie movie to be anything except entertaining, but the writers completely forgot that entertainment can't be achieved by littering some jokes here and there, it's investment in good character background and arcs and storytelling. The main plot of I need to find this girl and repair the rift is completely abandoned because Ken brings patriarchy to Barbieland? Suddenly all the Barbies are bimbos as if patriarchy is some magic spell? OK then...",2023-07-24
"A whole lot of potential but a lot of misses with the humorous bits. I don't think the writing is as sharp and witty as they intended to come across. For example, the scene with Sasha being urged to ""destroy Barbie"" didn't work for me. The lines weren't biting enough and were not immediately relatable observations; the drums that were supposed to emphasise the hard punches of truth that Sasha were throwing were lagging and doesn't help that the words were weak...and in the end it built up to nothing, no mic drop or climax. Ryan Murphy would be the person to come up with effective lines (think Santana, Kurt and most of all Sue Sylvester's lines from GLEE). 

The movie had parts that were too abstract that made me wonder if it's lazy writing that was self-convinced to be quirky, random ""oh it's a movie, it doesn't have to make sense"" and ""they'll get it"" sort of humour and ""deep"". The characters were forgettable and wasted opportunities, none of them were truly funny and unique or iconic. It's not toy story-touching, Pixar-deep or chick-flick classic.

 I would recommend Life-Size to someone interested in a ""Barbie"" movie over this. I do love the set designs, costumes and Lizzo's song.",2023-07-25

"(Rant, Spoilers ahead)

&#x200B;

I (17M) liked Barbie. However I cannot get the thought out of my head that it is at least somewhat against true equality between genders. What I got from the movie is that yes (duh) women face many issues that are talked about but disregarded, point to the whole monologue Gloria gives, and that the movie is a way to talk about those issue and put them in the forefront of peoples' minds. Nonetheless I still think that it's somewhat anti-male, at the end of the film once Ken realizes that his ""patriarchy"" is over and begins to cry and talk about how he is nothing without Barbie only for her to tell him to find out who he is for himself, is a great scene showing how Barbie truly does care for Ken and he doesn't need her to be his truest self. Yet they then follow that scene with another where Simu Liu's Ken asks for a role in the Supreme Court only to be immediately turned down and told no way, but he could have a secretary type of position; only for it again to be played out as a joke where he says he just wants to wear robes. Even having Helen Mirren the narrator of the story say, ""Eventually the Kens' will have the same amount of power women have in the real world."" Like why was this put in not only does it still point out the fact that everything the Barbies' did had no effect on the real world, but it puts down the Kens' as well. The Barbies end up putting everything back to as it was before Ken had instilled his ""Patriarchy"" why? Why not change it to have true equality for both groups. Ryan Goslings Ken points out that before he changed everything he was simply a thing for Barbie to look at and when she didn't he didn't have a good day. So why change the constitution back to a system where one group of people are still being demeaned to nothing. The Kens were just as much indoctrinated by Ryan Gosling as the other Barbies were. It's not right to say they weren't just because they now held the power. I just think that if the Barbies understood what it was like from Gloria and their own experiences of how it feels to be in a situation where you are clearly second fiddle and everyone sees you as an object why change everything back to the way it was still having a group of people being demeaned. It shows that they are no better than when the Kens had power. All in all the Barbies should have changed the system to accommodate both groups of people to have equal power and relevance after experiencing for themselves first hand what it was like. Also include Alan man he needs some justice too.",2023-07-28
"Full confession. I was a huge Barbie girl as a little one so definitely was not in the ‚Äúif you hate Barbie this movie is for you‚Äù category so bear that in mind.

I have to say it. I didn‚Äôt like this movie and it really upsets me because I wanted to and was super duper hyped for it (yes I wore pink and even took a Barbie).
For me, and I‚Äôm sorry perhaps I‚Äôm dumb and I just didn‚Äôt get a lot of it, but it really fell flat once they left Barbie land. I didn‚Äôt feel like the Barbie character was fun and goofy enough like I imagined she would be and her being sad and not wanting to be a Barbie was sad to me. I would have preferred the ending to be her coming to terms with being a hero to little girls and embracing that and then trying to change Barbie land to be more equal with Ken.

Also even though Ken discovering the patriarchy and his Mojo Dojo house was really fun and probably the most entertaining part of the movie after the first half hour, I don‚Äôt really like the messaging that Barbie and Ken (as they kind of represent men and women in this movie) can‚Äôt work together and get along. I did have a Ken and no I didn‚Äôt play with him as much as Barbie, but I was never imagining he was a bad person who would be mean to Barbie. Actually when I was finished with Barbie I would usually put them somewhere together so they could keep each other company and in case Barbie wanted some smooth body loving from her hottie Ken ü•∞ü§™ 
They were supposed to be a inseparable and caring team and I feel like this movie just undid that and it‚Äôs a shame.

I also wonder about the message this sends to boys and men. Like because the Barbie movie kind of ripped on men will they now go, ‚Äúwell the Barbie movie said men were dummies so now we can just go nuts and write women as hot bimbos in everything‚Äù?
I don‚Äôt know I feel like this movie is going to be worse for gender equality than it is better. Yeah I know it‚Äôs a doll movie and won‚Äôt have much impact either way but still.

All in all I‚Äôd give this 2 out of 5 and that‚Äôs mainly because the sets and casting are absolutely wonderful.",2023-08-01
"Just saw Barbie. As a movie it was good. Ryan Gosling was acting his heart out. Lots of good humour bits. Set design and outfits were very well done.

Its politics are iffy. I'm not saying it was 'woke' propaganda as idiot right-wingers are, who are purely reacting against surface-level characteristics of the movie. It just doesn't seem very well thought out or is really uneven and weird.

Yes, I'm talking about the Kens. A lot of people have outlined that the triumph of the movie is a reactionary counter-coup that puts the repressed underclass back in its place, with at best minor symbolic concessions.

The message about Ken is that despite legitimate grievances about society as a whole, actually, the problem is with him and he needs to mentally self-reflect and accept his place. Which is actually a very conservative mentality, Jordan Peterson literally has a talking point that you can't complain about issues with broad society, if your own life isn't fixed.

Yeah, it is mixed with a message about being 'entitled' to a woman, which makes it messy.

Other things I noticed was that while there was a very noticeable plus-sized Barbie and a wheelchair Barbie, that all the Ken's are either muscular or skinny. They all are under a 'Barbie Gaze' which goes completely unremarked on. And an audience gaze, since I could hear some women in the audience when Ryan Gosling was on screen.

The message about feminism is also really messy and limited. I saw someone call it upper middle-class feminism. If you listen to America Ferrera's rants to the Barbie's it's just about social expectations. Which is something that everybody deals with, male or female. I as a man have to deal with trying to manage to try not to scare people or talk over them, or be creepy. It's a very self-centred view to pretend that only the social expectations that impact you are bad and ignore that everybody else has them. The movie makes a point about body positivity by including plus-sized Barbie and Wheelchair Barbie and centring them in scenes. It just seems like the charge often lobbied at the body positivity movement that it's only for women, and not for men the way it's presented.

But nothing about you know material issues, like pay gaps, reproductive and other women health issues, poverty of elderly women, violence, etc. Women can't control their reproductive health in half the country Barbie is set in, and it isn't remarked on.

And at the end of the day, Ken is going back to sleeping on the beach, for all the self-actualisation that he has done. 

I mean her ranting about real-life issues should also go over their heads. They have no real frame of reference for it.

Also, the movie devotes much screen time to lampooning toxic masculinity. Like Ken's earnestly trying to explain things to Barbie who asked them. But the movie starts with Barbies playing with Ken's feelings and not caring about them as anything but accessories. And then solves the Ken problem by ... playing with Ken's feelings and putting them back as accessories with a minor concession. Toxic feminity which also goes unremarked on.

A feminism that is purely about lifting social expectations on women, while reinforcing social expectations on men is going to be alienating. Both to women who do have real material concerns in their life enforced on them by wider society. And to men who feel trapped and confused by contradictory social expectations and general social atomisation.

Maybe I'm just overthinking this. But I saw so much praise for this as a deep movie with an important message, and it just felt shallow.",2023-08-06
"Just saw it today. All the controversy and complaining seemed a bit overboard but now that I‚Äôve seen the movie, I understand where some of the backlash is coming from. 

I‚Äôm just not a fan of movies that are here to deliver a message first and foremost, because the narrative and all the other elements of the movie tend to suffer for it. In this case the feminism came across as goofy to me. Every man in the movie is cartoonishly stupid and it‚Äôs grating to watch. I‚Äôm on board with the message but certain lines and scenes left me wondering what exactly they‚Äôre getting at.",2023-08-23

"I personally didn't like it that much, maybe a 6/10 for me. I like the message but I was expecting more of a comedy. There's a few funny sections but ultimately there's just too many jokes that fall flat. Theres barely any big budget comedies these days with quotable or referencable moments, and it just seems like a wasted opportunity.

I also can't tell who the movie is for in terms of demographics. It definitely wasn't for younger kids or teenagers. Theres nothing particularly gen z or early millenial either. It kind of seems like it's for older millenial and gen x women, but then there's jokes like the Snyder cut one which makes me think they tried to put in something for everyone.",2023-07-26

Both films are about the relations between men and women. Shoot is considerably more darker, it's just that Barbie glosses over the more negative aspects of the patriarchy. You'll see women who do the same things in Barbie to take control of the system where in Shoot it's just to survive. The fact that Shoot has several insults where (women and men) are ""once you've seen one you've seen them all"", with the more literal form of that with Barbie. And how Barbie primes you to see the women in Shoot differently, i.e. why their lives seemingly revolve around men, than if Shoot were on its own. I can't recommend it enough.",2023-07-24

Barbie: The lego movie does a semester at Wesleyan and comes back without a sense of humor.,2023-07-27
"I liked most of it, funny to see Will Ferrel cast as another executive in a toy company after lego movie.

The start and end were great, though honestly I thought the midpoint in earth was quite meh, considering how fantastical barbieland was I thought they would have the real world, be, well, real but it was so unrealistic its insane.

Literally everyone they passed hit on them, the cops let them go twice for barbie being hot hitting on her and the cherry on top the company guy saying ""yeah patriarchy but keep it on the down low..."" None of it felt real at all, then they totally jumped the shark with mattel.

Lowest point of the movie for sure was the teenage daughter, her tangent was actually giving serious new velma vibes. Highest point for sure was the dance war.

Also found the line at the end didin't hit the same for me as it did others here ""maybe one day the kens here will have just as much power and influence as women have in the real world"" when it should been somthing like ""now the kens will have the same opertunities for power and influence as women in the real world.""

"I liked how the Barbie‚Äôs completely failed to learn from the Ken‚Äôs revolution in their exclusion of the them from all major positions of influence and basically relegating them to second class citizens. The idea they were going for was to have Barbieland and the real world contrast each other, with a matriarchy in the former and a patriarchy in the latter which they then completely abandoned in the end. But even so much as banning the Ken‚Äôs completely from the Supreme Court when nearly half of the Supreme Court in the real world is comprised of women really shows how this film wanted to communicate female supremacy rather than truly creating an equal world for everyone. The film seemed intent on trying to spite men and convey the utopia of a female-led society while completely abandoning it‚Äôs initial premise and message of treating everyone equal. The film started off strong and at times I thought they were really drive the point home.  But this film was so clearly a bait and switch in order to advance the director‚Äôs clear radical feminist ideas.",2023-07-25

I thought there was a lot of great and funny moments in the story, the costumes and set designs are amazing and I loved the first half of the film and wished there was more set in that world.   
I felt the messages in the story were good but also very preachy and political. It was basically taking a character that is an icon and making an adult parody about it, which was not how it was marketed at all.   
I feel on the fence with this film because honestly there was a lot of good parts but also the messages felt forced or rushed.

While ultimately it dismissed the gender politics by the end, which I thought was great, I found when it did kind of dive into it at half-way, it was a bit confused (women apparently hold no power in the real world except when in the mirroring Kenland they effortlessly create a war among them for their affection - as history reflects), but who isn't? The movie more or less dismisses it all anyways.

"The movie was okay overall! Nothing like you would like to watch it again.
The concept was good but has been mainstream since a couple of years now so all they had to do was to play with its execution (the story, not the set). The execution felt average at best.

"I read a Twitter post about how watching Barbie after Oppenheimer was going to be dissapointing. It wasn't wrong. It was a little too cartoony for my taste, especially in the finale. But I enjoyed a lot of the humour nonetheless.",2023-07-23
"I thought it could have been better. The first part was really great- depicted how I played with a Barbie when I was younger really perfectly! There was a perfect mashup of introduction, comedy, fashion, and just overall pink vibes. I was really excited for Barbie to go to the real world and battle the patriarchy and was surprised to see the plot go in a different way. It went from mother-daughter relationships to the patriarchy to fragile masculinity? 

I mean, I understood what the director was trying to do- but she just shoved so much things in that didn‚Äôt get resolved at all. Sasha and her mom suddenly had a good relationship, the patriarchy was resolved only in Barbie land and there was barely anything that helped the real world, and the whole Ken thing was‚Ä¶. It just felt like it was spreading the wrong message- that men want power because they don‚Äôt like being rejected??? Because they can‚Äôt cry??? Because they don‚Äôt feel appreciated enough??? I don‚Äôt know. It just felt like they skimmed over each ideas and didn‚Äôt really delve into them. There were some good points but it didn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere. Maybe I was expecting too much from the movie. 

And the whole thing about the cellulites, to the pregnant Barbie, to Barbie constantly saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ugly, no one likes me!‚Äù, and the whole masculinity belongs to men and femininity belongs to women felt kind of‚Ä¶ eh to me. Like the whole felt SO CLOSE to talking about feminism and taking apart the patriarchy and misogyny but it just never went there. The ending just felt kind of rushed too- like I expected Barbie to become a ‚Äúhelper-Barbie‚Äù and decide to go to the human world to help the women there. But she just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. 

But the comedy was on point and there were still some golden moments. It‚Äôs a good start for people who don‚Äôt really understand the patriarchy/feminism- in a fun way! I feel like I was just expecting a lot and the film didn‚Äôt do justice for my excitement? But it was still very fun to watch in theatres.",2023-07-21

"I'm a 33 year old Ken and I think I'm gonna go see it again in a few days. It was just... real good, for everyone. Funny, beautifully shot, with motivation messages for girls and boys (which I didn't expect to be honest), unexpected plot, character development. It was light and a bit goofy in a good way, like even the 'real world' felt a bit cartoonish/dolly, but again it wasn't stupid and out of place.

Audience really loved it and I just left with this warm feeling afterwards. It's just really good. Again, I thought it's going to be a truman show with a message about girl power, but it's actually way more than that. Will Ferrel is great, MR is great, but Gosling really steals the show and for me Ken had the best arc.

Oh by the way it's not for kids. There's nothing bad or adult, but it's not a kids' movie (because we had a lot of kids in the screening and they were definitely bored).

"i don‚Äôt understand why some people are SO CRITIC about the film‚Ä¶

for me it‚Äôs just a film that shows idiocracy of the world and pointing out important things in a silly manner:

1. how easy it is to convince people to follow certain ideology

*Ken came back to barbieland*

- it‚Äôs patriarchy now

*people followed without questioning*

- okay

*barbie came back to barbieland*

- fuck patriarchy 

*people AGAIN followed without questioning*

2. how many men are JUST friends, instead of boyfriends and that females need to see that and comprehend, instead of taking it for granted

3. females also DO HATE other females and that is what is similar between men and women

4. stereotypical dating experience for females, like: playing the guitar, or how come you not see god father (that one really got meü§£üóø)

5. women-oriented brands (whose target audience are FEMALES) are ruled mostly by men

6. power can be even with skirt and heels 

7. things won‚Äôt change until WE as FEMALES will start changing things ourselves

8. life is constantly changing and we cannot do anything about it 

9. how hard it is to be a mom, with maintaining her own happiness and being a good mom  

10. females are constantly being hitted on streets 

11. men can also be sad and cry

12. it‚Äôs okay not to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù (team Alanü´∂üèª and weird Barbie)

13. it‚Äôs okay not to know who you want to be and it‚Äôs not necessary to stick to one label (you can be not only Barbie-doctor etc)

"Sooooo I just watched the movie and luckily all 6 people in the screening didn‚Äôt talk loudly or played with their phones during the movie. Small step for men&women but big win for human kind! 

Loved the movie. Quirky Greta did another wonderful job. Loved all the small details and wonderful messages across the board. Definitely worth a recent rewatch. 

When discussing the movie afterwards me and my SO had the same questions about two specific scenes and their meaning. And I was wondering what other people thought about that.

***** spoilers ahead, as I will be discussing two scenes. The second one is a turning point in the movie, so watch the movie before reading

1. The High School scene
Barbie sees Sasha and wants to approach her. She is stopped by a girl, who basically tells her that Sasha will destroy her, if she talks to her. 

I was completely taken out of the movie by this scene. As I didn‚Äôt understand who that girl was and why she would do what she did. First I thought she was some kind of supervisor to watch over kids so no strangers can approach the children, than I thought she feared Sasha as she described her as kind of a bully/dangerous individual (which she isn‚Äôt, everything Sasha said to Barbie was mean but not without logic). And when Barbie left crying that girl got even more screen time saying something like I told you so. So what exactly did this scene mean and why wasn‚Äôt it left on the cutting room floor? Barbie could have directly approached Sasha and the experience for us viewers would have been the same. Is it just because hey we need a quirky girl for whatever reason.

***big spoiler don‚Äôt read before watching the movie!***

2. Inciting Ken infighting
So the Barbies get rid of the brainwashing of all Barbies and want to initiate an infight between the Kens. All the Barbies go on the exact same date with their respective Kens. Alpha-Kens are self indulgingly playing guitar and ‚Äúeye-banging‚Äù their dates for four hours thinking that is what they want, rather than boosting their own ego with it. This part I get but suddenly all Barbies disturb the play and start to look at their phones and talk about how great another Ken is and just leaves to go to another Ken. Kens get irritated and they plan to destroy the other Kens the next morning.

I‚Äôm probably missing something but even though the Kens are annoying and narcissistic, they don‚Äôt really deserve that treatment, of being left on a date for another person. 

As this was a big turning point in the story, I thought this was a cheap way of setting up the divergence. Especially with alpha-males and toxic masculinity groups and incels talking about how wicked women are, toying with men and stuff. It would make much more sense if the Barbies did something normal/feminist behaviour and the alpha-Kens start to hijack the conversation with their toxic masculinity. If going the jealousy route, something on the line of ‚Äúhey the other Ken is good at *insert proud man hobby* why not let him do it‚Äù. Make it about horses as Beach-Ken loves them. It would make much more sense to resolve this around the tropes of toxic masculinity, than women ‚Äúmanipulating‚Äù men with jealousy. Now you gave all the edgelords, alpha males and incels reason to say, look this is how women manipulate us.


So please tell me that we were wrong and we just couldn‚Äôt see the hidden layer of this scene!

"One other thing, reddit is a young crowd with a lot of teens and students so I know people will crap on me for saying this, but as someone with a young daughter I now feel I can‚Äôt really buy her the Barbie play sets etc, if Mattel has made the backstory of Barbieland that the Kens live on the street and only Barbie had jobs and oppresses Ken. I mean what kind of message is that to send to little kids? 

And yes I know this wasn‚Äôt a kids movie and no, we didn‚Äôt personally take our daughter, but the theatre I was at was full of little kids.

Regardless of that I‚Äôm sure Mattel‚Äôs plastic junk will be clogging our oceans for hundreds of years to come.",2023-08-01

"34F - Figured out why I didn‚Äôt like Barbie

Anyone of similar age remember going to see Mean Girls in theaters?  Remember walking out super stressed/anxious?  Remember hating the movie?

It came out when I was still in High School and I remember going to see it with my girlfriends - we drove ourselves, so we had to be 16/17 - we all left kinda hating the movie and feeling really stressed - it‚Äôs because it was far to dang real! It wasn‚Äôt a comedy - it was an intensely horrifying documentary ü§£ (love the movie now that I‚Äôm far removed from HS)

Anyhow - I think that‚Äôs why I left Barbie feeling the same - it‚Äôs far to fricken real for me - the last company I was at was 90% white, straight, married men and they treated me horrifically (i.e. I spoke up about some math we were a little over zealous on and potentially going to lose customers over if they found out we were full of crap - only to have my manager say ‚Äúwell. You‚Äôre just wrong.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and a second direct quote: ‚Äúif you weren‚Äôt a woman, you‚Äôd be fired by now‚Äù which was a follow-up statement to the convo: ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm treated differently because I‚Äôm the only female on the team‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre female‚Äù)

I gave up on everything/life for a minute >!just like Barbie did!< and became really depressed >!again, just like Barbie!< - it was a really rough time in my life and it was barely 6 months ago that the f-ers laid me off after being miserable working for them for a year and a half - so Barbie is just a little too real for me right now (hopefully I grow to enjoy it like with Mean Girls because I did still laugh quite a bit!! >!Weird Barbie was the best ü§£ü§£ü§£ my sister and I definitely had one of those and she was indeed always in the splits!<)

Figured I‚Äôd share since a lot folks saying they didn‚Äôt like the movie are getting labeled as ‚Äúmust hate women‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not the case with me - so likely not the case with others, too! üòÅ

"So regarding Barbie having a negative impact on girls/women and the edgy teen roasting Barbie....is that even true? I highly doubt Barbie ""set back women 50 years"". That's just conjecture. Barbie at the worst just represented society in that moment. 

Now before someone comes at me with ""Barbie promotes an impossible standard yada yada"" Do we have quantifiable data to say Barbie has caused X amount of damage to girls/women, slowed down women's advancement (funny enough a big counter hysteria regarding unrealistic Barbie standards may have actually ended up helping women, thus Barbie helping), or just a small handful of people raised hell with their personal critiques about Barbie and how Barbie personally made them feel. Those takes were able to gain some mainstream traction and embed themselves within the cultural psyche. 

I honestly think most girls that played with Barbie as children have positive feedback on Barbie dolls. Some insensitive/poorly executed dolls throughout the decades doesn't matter that much, and the counter reaction more than makes up for those dolls (and helped make this movie).",2023-07-22

"Great movie but i guess i hoped the plot and thrill would be a bit more.Felt more like a marvel film with great dialogues and funny lines but nothing of extreme suspense or thrill.

The kens, who were fighting over 'beach' suddenly reading 3 books and then 'brainwashing' the brilliant Barbies into being their bitches was a bad arc, indirectly targeting that if a woman takes the different routel/obeys a man, its not her independent decision but that she is being brainwashed (By Ken) was something that could have been differently done(Kens make a potion perhaps?)

Other than that the confusion that a barbie can do and thnk what she wants but if she doesn't believes in a particular mindset/type of empowerment the  she is being brainwashed and its the patriarchy ,undermining both the Barbies intellect and overstating kens one making it all his fault was also very shallow writing and i really they missed a great plot point here.

Other than the the whole preface its barbies world and she is a girl boss who picks her own ending and does what she wants was great in carrying the message and i hope Greta gets many major franchises after this",2023-07-23
"Barbie was fun. I do dislike the very, very dated form of elitist feminism the film promotes, which reflects the priorities of rich white girls at Barnard or something.",2023-07-23
"You know this could've been a great satirical social commentary comedy if it had of just been about how the kens where sick of being treated like second class citizens and decided to change things, but ended up treating the Barbie's as bad and neglectful as they treated them. In the end they acknowledge that both sides had problems and decided to try and implement real equality between the kens and Barbie's.

Also with the Barbie's being the more dominant gender being that it is barbieworld and therefore they hold the prominent positions of power and play the important roles (president/doctors/cops/military), so shouldn't ken be the one learning from the real world that they can be anything and not just a Barbie accessory??",2023-07-25
"During the monologue, I could personally relate to a bunch of the negative experiences listed, even though I am a straight white dude in a position of relative power. Which I think weakened the feminist message a bit, by conflating problems that are just innate to the human experience with gender dynamics. Maybe these issues are more true for women though, I don‚Äôt know.

On the plus, as someone who actually tries to use my platform to elevate women in my industry, I felt called out by the messaging that it needs to be okay to not be excellent. This is something new I‚Äôll keep in the back of my mind for being a better ally.",2023-07-25
"10/10. This movie was everything i wanted it to be and more. A lot of posters are complaining about its lack of subtleness. While there certain themes thrown in the viewer's face, there was also layers of feminist theory and intersectionality baked into every layer of this film. 

Ultimately, I think think Barbieland is supposed to represent the women (and more specifically white feminists) who believe the feminist movement has already won- think the ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù type. So many women argue now that the feminist movement is done, equality has been achieved- ignoring the barriers still in place for many women, especially those with intersecting identities. 

That‚Äôs why it takes America Ferrera‚Äòs character and her daughter, women with intersecting identities, to teach Barbie that her brand of feminism has not helped or solved all the problems for every women. By the end of the movie, Barbie‚Äôs decision to leave Barbieland and go to the real world represents how she‚Äôs accepted this reality and no longer wants to live behind the veil of ignorance. 

It also represents how this ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù feminism is commercialized and sold to women. Like how Mattel and its executive board of men still control Barbieland behind the scenes, girl boss feminism ignores that men still hold much of power in the world. And tagging #girlboss on IG photos doesn‚Äòt change this. 

This movie is also clearly criticizing white beauty standards. This is illustrated by America Ferrera‚Äôs character, a Latino women, sketching a blonde white women and later telling Barbie ‚ÄùI can‚Äôt be you.‚Äù This is commentary on the impact of media that has traditionally presented white beauty standards as ideal has on non-white women from an early age. It also shows the impact of unattainable beauty standards on even women like Barbie- or real life women like Marilyn Monroe- who do fit these ideal standards.

America Ferrera‚Äòs speech at the end that cures the Barbies is literally the concept of double consciousness first theorized by W.E.B. DuBois, a notable early civil rights thinker and activist. There‚Äôs so much more that I could dive into, but whoever wrote this script is clearly well-versed in feminist film theory. I could write a master‚Äôs thesis about all the theory presented in this film.   


Lastly, I find it laughable that people think the end of the movie invalidates the message of the film. Barbieland reverses gender roles. So this represents how in the real world, even when feminists ‚Äúwon‚Äú battles like securing the right to vote, it still took decades for meaningful change to be implemented. Expecting that change to be immediate when gender roles are reversed is irony at its finest. They‚Äôre missing the point that both the patriarchy and feminism are institutions and ideas people invented to deal with living in a shitty world. There isn‚Äôt a magical way to fix it- we saw how everyone was negatively impacted in some fashion by both the gender roles and systems in the real world and Barbieland. However, by acknowledging this dynamic and emphasizing with each other, we can begin to fix it.

I think this movie did a fantastic job in bringing to light criticisms of both feminism and the patriarchy. It uses satire in a very similar way to the Scum Manifesto, which is going to going over a lot of people‚Äôs heads. Regardless, I loved every minute of it and am glad this movie is bringing these conversations into  the spotlight.",2023-07-25
"Man I REALLY wanted to like this. I don't. Margo is a gem, Gosling delivers above and beyond. The rest of the cast does their part. (I wish Cera was more of a character tbh.) But damn, what a mess. It really needed to figure out what it wanted to be. It felt like three episodes of the ""Barbie HBO special"" vs a complete movie. Everything moved so fast we never got time to really settle into a ruleset before we were introduced to another. The last act was a great idea but it was over so soon, same with the first. For the middle, well light spoilers bur. She spends 5 minutes in the ""real world"" it seems, not enough to really sell the necessity of that plotline. Although the mother was a real treat.",2023-07-26
"I was super excited to watch this, hoping it would be great. Honestly thought it wasn't good. I think they had to dig in deeper into the feminist arc, as a man I had no problem with that (as no one should), in fact most of the good laughs from the movie came from that kind of humor. But everything was just so spoon fed, they explained in excruciating detail and the dialogue was boring as hell.

So much stuff just took me out because of how unfunny it was. Everything in mattel was unnecesary and LONG. That scooby doo office chase scene was nowhere near close to being funny in the slightest. All the ""HI KEN, HI BARBIE"" stuff was just head scractching at first and grew superbly old real quick. You see the message the movie wants to deliver from a mile away. The one surprise was that the kens rebel in barbie world and I thought that was incredibly forced and implemented so poorly (though most of the actual good jokes came from the Human character helping out barbies regain themselves).

Overall, to me, most of the jokes didnt land. Barbie ""thinking about dying"" and then the music stops is cringe and not really funny. I dont really see how this is getting so much praise, aside from the incredible Set and World building, which is AMAZINGLY WELL MADE.

The best part of the movie was the last 20 minutes and those were pretty good actually (HORRIBLE ken civil war and dance off aside). Barbie and the creator talking was really sweet. Again, the feminism part (not that I have to care) was ok, it actually brought some of the good jokes. Its just a bad movie around a good message. 5/10",2023-07-26
"So, yeah... i didn‚Äôt get this one at all. They were clearly not aiming to make just a comedy but something that had a definite theme to it that gave us an analysis of the world and the systems we have centering what men and women are conceptualized as. But everything fell flat for me because none of the characters, settings and interactions felt real. It was all very aggressively skit like with no rhyme or reason. So whatever revelation the characters were having, to me it seemed like they were just being silly and saying things in a silly way. So at the end, i ended up not feeling any connection to the themes and the story. 

I am surprised that Gerwig and Baumbach wrote this because their previous films were known to make things feel natural.

"One thing about this movie I don‚Äôt get is if Goslings Ken is beach Ken meant for Margot Robbie‚Äôs Barbie (and their similar outfits show this as well), then why is Ken like a dumb himbo beach dude but Margot Robbie‚Äôs Barbie is using these elaborate terms like ‚Äúcognitive dissonance‚Äù and quite clever? 
Shouldn‚Äôt she be a bimbo beach Barbie as well?

Seems like because Greta Gerwig wanted to show the Kens as dopey and all the Barbies as empowered and smart there was a big missed opportunity to make the Barbies more fun and interesting. You could have had President Barbie, genius scientist Barbie but also bimbo ‚Äúmath class is hard‚Äù barbie. And there could have been funny moments between barbies. But it seems like most of the Barbies have the same basic personality.

It‚Äôs ironic because I know that was meant to show Barbies and women in a good way and the Kens/men as the Burt of the joke, but it really just made the Barbies kind of bland and boring in their own movie imo. And the worst part is, Margot Robbie‚Äôs Barbie is kind of the most boring one.

Idk seems like it would have been more fun if you had Barbies and Kens all doing different jobs in Barbie land and having different personalities according to their outfits.",2023-07-24
"The America Ferrera speech on ordinary Barbie was SO confusing since it's kind of implied that this Barbie would look like America...which seems like they kind of already do? What makes her ""normal""?

"Great cast, great sets and really funny movie.

Movie is also very political, which given that Barbie had such a large cultural (often controversial) impact makes sense. So my comment below is going to be on the political message:

I'm sorry women still feel forced/pushed by society to meeting these expectations of them that are unachievable because the expectations themself are mutually exclusive (mentioned in speech by the mom towards the end). Being who you are as a person should be enough (Barbie telling old woman on bench she's beautiful). And that men to this day often don't understand that women don't owe them anything (ken coming to grips with it not being barbie &ken, but just barbie, and ken). These are clearly themes that still resonate and it's important to address them.

The world is still male centric in many ways and to show this imbalance the movie uses the topic of supreme court seats. However, by not giving Ken a single seat on the supreme court at the end, because Barbie wants to match the inequality she saw in the real world, the movie suggests that the power balance towards men is 9-0. Which it just isn't. It's 6-3 if you want to use supreme court seats as representation. So we aren't at equality yet and we should keep fighting for equality, but inequality in todays ""patriarchy"" as they call it in the movie isn't at 9-0 levels.

And I think that's kind of where you lose the message as a movie and things become a bit heavy handed for my taste",2023-07-31
"Wanted to make this post but it redirected me here.
Just watched the Barbie movie

TL;DR
Barbie movie is great, nothing against men, just empowering women. One bad scene imo. Other than that, def a good watch and lesson of the real world were in now.

(30m) And I just cannot understand why other men were so put off by this movie!!??

I guess mainly chronically online, conservative men, but still.

**If you as a man, took offense to the Barbie movie? You are corrupt, misguided and just plain delusional** 

It wholly encompasses the patriarchy we still have today, with contrast to a Matriarchy of the ""Barbie World"". Along with how ""easy"" it is to take over the world like the Ken's take over Barbie World, and how Barbie World isn't better from men in charge. To then how easy it is for Barbie to take back Ken World.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it had me laughing immediately at the little desert girls smashing their baby dolls, to the Beach off, and just every other joke made in the movie! Especially the Barbies easily being able to fool the Kens. It was very funny while also covering serious topics.

I guess spoilers for the next paragraph ahead but I won't cover it.

One ""joke"" that didn't land for me was the Will Ferrel ""ordinary barbie"" scene.
He says it's a terrible idea, his ""team"" then says it'll make money, so he says he ""loves it!"".
My interpretation of it is that women being the normal, submissive housewife isn't good enough, or that them being ordinary people still isn't good enough. But how is that a joke? How is that funny at all? I'd much rather the scene be him hear the explanation and a) consult the team and like it, or b) think about it for a min and have like a ""Eureka moment"" for all his team.
That one scene just seems to undermine the entire premise of the movie for me.


Aside from that one scene, 9/10 movie imo. Again, I'm a 30M and this absolutely gave me joy to watch. I definitely played Barbie's with my cousins as a kid and no man should be ashamed of that, or ashamed to be emotional. I def had my crying moments during this film and just thoroughly enjoyed the movie, as everyone should.

That's my rant, thank you for reading if you got this far :)",2023-09-12
"Absolutely loved Barbie. The cinematography was great, both Gosling and Robbie nailed their roles, the dance scenes were gorgeous, and the commentary was something that everyone needs to hear and reflect on.
Issa Rae was amazing as president and Mirren was perfect for the narrator.
I‚Äôm very surprised with some of the jokes and truth bombs that were dropped in the movies. 10/10. I do agree that the ending was a bit shakey, but ultimately landed.",2023-07-22

"Was a great movie! I really enjoyed navigating the use of healthy and toxic masculinity. Not to say that I don't understand that the main point of the movie was female empowerment ofc.

I feel like this is a must watch for men. It's just such a compelling depiction of gender roles in society being brought to their extremes yet maintaining accuracy. It makes you think and put a bit of your own biases on trial that you may not have even known you had.

"The movie was really entertaining.
The humor was sometimes dumb funny and sometimes clever funny. I liked it.

Every single one of the cast was perfect.
The scenery is phenomenal, the clothes, the visual style.

My only problem with it was that I felt it tried to empower women by dumbing down men, and create the feeling that men destroyed the world. It's not very gender equality..

And even if I disagree with the way it empowered women, at least make it good. But a lot of the empowerment was spoon fed, no subtest.

I liked the ending but I wish it would create better solutions for the kens",2023-07-25
"I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else thinks they kind of shit the bed with the Barbie/Ken lack of romance.

I think it would‚Äôve been SO much more effective if Barbie had slowly come to a realization that she didn‚Äôt have feelings for Ken as she became more human over the course of the movie. As it stands, it‚Äôs implied that she was stringing him along on purpose and it also acts as if Barbie and Ken were never supposed to be a couple in the first place. If Barbie was trying to force herself into a relationship because she was ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù rather than purposefully leading him on, it would‚Äôve made for a better commentary on the pressures put on women. Instead she was just a bit of a bitch about it.",2023-07-25

It really felt like a movie that studios have been afraid to make for a long time and I hope we get a fresh wave of movies like this. Ryan Gosling is electric and is getting a lot of attention for obvious reason but I really loved Margot's performance of Barbie as well and I think I will appreciate it more and more with each watch.

"Man, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. Not perfect, and I'll get to that in a sec, but overall, this film has a ton going for it. You could tell the cast was having fun with it. 

Gerwig's aesthetics for the film were perfect.

While Margot was great, Gosling stole the show as Ken. I honestly found the intention of flipping the feminist message of ""a woman doesn't need to be defined by a man"" and directing it towards men to deconstruct the way men seek status through women was legitimately profound.

That being said, there are some funky elements of the gender mechanics that are a little wonky at the end. Like, the movie sort of goes out of its way to show that the Kens are sort of lesser. They are accessories, even if it doesn't ultimately effect who are they are as people, but that just raises such an odd question about the movie's themes given the very explicit intention of comparing Barbieland and the Real World to criticize patriarchy. This is reinforced by the Kens being denied real political power over their lives at the end.

Also, honestly, Ferrara's plotline with her daughter and the resolution essentially just being the daughter going ""no Mom, you drawings are cool"" just feel underbaked.

Over all though, despite this critiques, I genuinely loved this movie, certainly way more than I was expecting to as a man in my 30's.",2023-07-21

Movie got a couple of chuckles out of me here and there but i dont remember any of the jokes really. Nearly fell asleep the last 10ish minutes.

"10/10, movie if the year. Had an extremely wide diversity of elements going on for it. Demonstrated a lot of Matrix tier sciences of the holographic universe, from inter-dimensional travel, Ken teleporting all over California, Barbie downloading of memories while meditating and her ""shining"" moments, and the alchemical interactions of elementary souls with the personality types that we are programmed and born with. 

In the beginning barbie was just that, the personality type of Barbie. But as she was exposed to the higher dimensions of earth (as Earth has full spectrum science and soul/personality types, unlike Barbie land where there is no fire or water and only Barbie Ken personality types in different bodies... and Allen) her soul evolved to want more out of life. Kens soul was incapable of experiencing joy independent of Barbie, so when he was exposed to the real world of sociopathic patriarchal power he adopts patriarchy as a means to find meaning in his own life. 

The Mattel execs portrayed Illuminati tier understanding of alternate dimensions. The men in power, Mattel and the Department of Homeland Security both had knowledge of Barbie land, and Mattel was tasked by DHS with capturing the interdimensional being of Barbie (but not Ken) and the suppresion of knowledge like some kind of SCP secret society. As the movie depicts Mojo dojo casa house, the idea originated in Barbieland before it manifested in our own world, suggesting that original thoughts and ideas have to first nucleate in alternate dimensions before those ideas can manifest here on earth.  The Mattel Exec (Hollywood Ferrell) even had occult powers of influence similar to the jedi mind trick as he was almost able to convince Barbie to imprison herself. The CEO loses his temper, starts to yell at Barbie and starts calling her names, and it Almost works. Barbies eyes glazes over, she starts talking dreamily and complacently takes steps toward her prison box. Fortunately she breaks out of the trance the CEO put her under. Ken returns to Barbie land with powers of influence of his own and uses it to wreck havoc on the social structure of Barbie land bc the Barbies had no psychic defenses against Kens power of influence (bc Ken now has the advantage of being an interdimensional being and has been exposed to a wide spectrum/radiation of personality soul types in the real world that are non-existant in Barbieland). 

Ken wanted power bc his soul was programmed to be codependent to Barbie, but Barbie had such a dream life she really had no need for Ken other than a pretty face on the background. After Kens failed attempt at taking over Barbie land, he and Barbie converse and that's when he starts to break free of the Matrix and his personality type. Barbie helps him realize, ""Its Barbie... And Its Ken"". That's when he has a revelation that, as barbie puts it, ""Maybe the things that make you, you, aren't really you"". Pretty plain and typical line but it hits Ken hard and it changes him. ""Ken... Is... ME!"" He is then released from the constraints of his stereotype, to live a life for himself, rather than for Barbie, and his soul changes with refreshed outlook on the meaning of his life. 

Truth is, the character developement portrayed in the movie is more drastic and impactful than what we experience here in the real world. Neither Ken or Barbie were ashamed to show that they were learning, changing and evolving, while that sort of expression of genuine gayness, being true to oneself, on earth is socially unaccepted. It's something to keep in mind, just as weird barbie wants to control sanitation, that the elite of Hollywood, government, corporations of our earth want absolute control over our lives and controlling ones culture is among the most powerful effective and discreet ways of waging war, because exposure to culture and exciting energies and souls are catalyst to revelations.

But aside of the occultic ***¬°SUBLIME!*** illuminati messages in the movie, this movies great. Best music, world class dance scenes, cheap jokes at the patriarchy that just melts like butter, fabulously fantastic wardrobes, the comedic stream of jokes don't slow don't ever.

the ending also felt a little weird to me. like the movie earlier on definitely says that Ken and Barbie (the main ones) are BF/GF (Ken says it, Barbie doesn't deny) and in that context Barbie is definitely a toxic partner but the resolution of the movie is that Barbie doesn't have to be forced into a relationship she doesn't want? Of course, but the movie is the one that said they were in a relationship in the first place? Again, feels like a copout to use as another avenue for another shallow message that isn't anything new

Michael Cera's character was hilarious. everytime he was on screen I was cracking up at how awkward he was. 

I had done the Barbenheimer yesterday so saw both and overall they were both good, but the surface level themes and storytelling in this movie were very obvious after seeing the other movie. As soon as they showed the kid playing with dolls it was obvious it was the mother and as soon as Ken started going back it was obvious he was going to have a villain arch",2023-07-24
"We never arrive late at movies, but this time due to various reasons, we arrived in the movie theater 5 minutes late, and the movie had already begun! Cineplex UltraAVX in Quebec. I suspect there was some mistake and the ads and trailers did not play. We were pissed to miss a few minutes, downloaded the movie afterwards just to be able to see those first minutes.

I thought the movie was fun, great nostalgia vibe. Not a perfect movie but it's a good comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously while still being somewhat serious. Some moments are a bit on the nose.",2023-07-25
"Barbie

Did you grow up playing with Barbie‚Äôs? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie‚Äôs are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.

In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler‚Äôs idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn‚Äôt worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn‚Äôt the inspiration she thought she was.

Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies‚Äô problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn‚Äôt have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.

The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie‚Äôs role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn.  Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future. 

Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what‚Äôs happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.

There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn‚Äôt even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren‚Äôt exactly honest people.  Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.

Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO‚Äôs of company‚Äôs make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don‚Äôt pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.",2023-07-25
"Can‚Äôt say a lot that hasn‚Äôt already been said ‚Äî this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. Best theater experience I‚Äôve ever had.

The one thing I‚Äôd like to add is the masterful nod to Being There, when Ken is discovering the patriarchy. It used the same song (or possibly similar enough, might have to check) that they used when Chance stepped outside of the old man‚Äôs house and into the world for the first time. The one that used the 2001 music. Just absolutely outstanding.",2023-07-21

"Just watched it today. I hadn't been following any marketing about it.

I'm a female and I did play with the Barbie as a kid but I was never crazy about it. The thing I wanted to have the most was the high heels when I would play with it haha... Funny because now that I'm a grown woman I don't wear them and never have actually! I just thought they looked nice when I was a kid. 

Barbie never made me feel bad about myself to be honest. Was just a toy. 

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie. Wasn't a masterpiece of course but it was enjoyable and I thought Gosling was especially funny. I don't care about feminism or that sort of stuff. I don't even think it was heavy-handed with the message it wanted to convey all in all. It couldn't have been subtle about it. It's just how the movie was made that made it so it had to be done like that. 

I just watched it as entertainment and it did its job for me. 

I had read many negative comments just yesterday about it on here so I was expecting it to have big flaws but honestly I thought it was an OK movie. 

I think Ryan Gosling helped a lot in that respect in my opinion because he was funny in it and I think without him I would have probably liked it less. 

I would give it a 7/10.",2024-03-15

Half way of the movie I thought the movie would end with Barbie and Ken would learn to love each other and work together as a team, respect each other, bringing the new narrative of ""happily ever after"" but it doesn't. Which is sad to me.",2023-07-21

For women the message is great, but as a man, I enjoyed Kens story arc too, and his ""come to god"" moment at the end was great.

"I know some people think Barbie dolls are damaging to girls/women, but really? Are they really that bad, I would not say they have halted women's progress at all (the edgy teen stating they set back women 50 years, lol), and at worst they simply represent and reflect society at that moment in time. 

Even the blow up breast doll from 1975 was just actually about a doll becoming a teenager with a single breast size increase. I thought it was the doll's breast becoming bigger and bigger and bigger (assuming the worst), but nope it's more so about puberty.",2023-07-21

I liked the visual displays in Barbieland and thought some of the one liners throughout the movie were funny.  

I didn't feel sympathy for Barbie's struggle, wondering if that was the intention to not feel sorry for a doll.  The Ken takeover was an interesting development. The Mattell guys seemed like they lacked something in that story line.  Ending was meh.",2023-07-26

You have two of the biggest movie stars in the world who could‚Äôve delivered something super meaningful without being didactic and bordering on the extreme left of ideology. It honestly did paint males as a collective bad. That is not the way to get your point across and a point that is actually more diluted than ever in todays progressive society. The far left simply have the recoil of saying you‚Äôre sexist if you point this out. It‚Äôll likely go down in hindsight as cringe. I‚Äôm not sure how old the writers are but most of it seemed to come from a writer maybe around 25 years of age who doesn‚Äôt realise that in the real world, women aren‚Äôt hapless Jews and men, all evil Nazis.",2023-07-23
"Literally just got home from my screening and I have thoughts.

Firstly, I genuinely think this movie should be nominated for best picture. Also Margot and Ryan should absolutely get acting nominations for this. I think this was probably the best work they‚Äôve done.

Secondly I love how this movie discusses the complexities of Barbie. Like I thought Mattel wouldn‚Äôt allow the movie to heavily address the negativity attached to Barbie but the movie tackled it head on and acknowledged it as a genuine flaw of the brand. I also love how the movie used characters like Midge and Magic Earring Ken. 

I also love how heavy and blatant the movie was with gender roles in the real world. I know some people are gonna call this movie woke and say it‚Äôs pushing an agenda. My response to that crowd? Duh! It‚Äôs Barbie. Of course the movie was gonna push an agenda. Barbie has always been a brand centered on feminism (even if they haven‚Äôt always done it correctly). It‚Äôs no surprise that the movie took the stance ‚Äúwomen are just as intelligent and capable as men‚Äù. I myself am not a woman but I do know what oppression and discrimination feels like. Greta did a great job of accurately showing those truths without being preachy or coming off as insincere. It didn‚Äôt feel like Barbie was doing this to check a box off a clipboard. This message had meaning.

Finally I love how much energy everyone put into this. Even the people with small roles. I know he was on screen for a small amount of time but I could not take my eyes off Scott Evans everytime he popped up.",2023-07-21
"Gotta say after back to back slam dunks from Gerwig - this was a huge letdown. 

It was just messy and clunky. Act to act it didn't seem to follow a coherent idea. So many ideas - many of them good - but none of them got their due. 

The feminism was just super on the nose and I'm not sure Gerwig had anything compelling to say about the patriarchy. It's almost like they suggested women's default was to be deferential to men hence them needing defenses to survive patriarchy. 

Maybe my expectations were to high - but this movie just never clicked into place to me despite many lol moments",2023-08-06

"This was an ok movie that for some reason lost steam about 2/3rds of the way in right around when they head back to Barbieland. Where it truly excelled was the comedy - Ryan Gosling was absolutely hilarious and Will Ferrel was wisely kept in small doses. Where it fell flat was when it went it became a Jezebel article come to life, i.e. the constant painting of women as perennial victims culminating in America Ferrera's painful whinefest of a speech. Overall 6/10.",2023-07-30
"I notice no one is talking about the messaging about beauty. When Barbie turned to that old woman on the bus bench and told her she's beautiful as if it's some touching moment. I was thinking, ""Why does it matter if she's beautiful or not? What does that have to do with anything?""

Let's face it. You grow old, you look like shit. And that's okay. What we *should* be doing is normalizing getting old and having wrinkles. Barbie is scared to death of cellulite but the movie wants to imply that it's okay to have cellulite. We should want to move pass so much emphasis on physical beauty.

The immense pressure to look good is terrible on women and men. Look at South Korea. There was an even ""beauty strike"". Every time the Barbies called each other beautiful, I just cringed. ""Women should be more equal... but let's keep the toxic social pressure to look good.""",2023-07-31
"This movie was worse than I expected it to be (I expected it to be pretty good.) Here are some things I didn‚Äôt like:

-It had a very goofy happy go lucky vibe but it came off kind of childish and irritating imo. I can see how that was supposed to be ironic but that didn‚Äôt make it less annoying. 

-Why does everything have to be a diverse multiverse now? I love the animated Spider-Man movies but the multiverse concept being everywhere strikes me as kind of weird. Every time it‚Äôs used it seems like a lazy way to add diversity to a movie. Barbie is about a woman and Spider-Man is about a poc. Can we just focus on those experiences in depth instead of adding random side characters to lazily show that anyone can be the main character? All these characters do is make silly comments and it just seems like fluff we don‚Äôt need. 

-stereotypical Margot Robbie Barbie seems to really like old women for absolutely no reason at all? She is sitting on a bench next to an old woman and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù for no reason which feels awkwardly random. Then the old woman says I know and then Margot Robbie just leaves.

-Ken is not funny and his whole misunderstanding of male privilege is kind of a stolen joke from the recent beavis and butthead movie and goes down the same exact way

-The feminist messages in the movie are nothing new and don‚Äôt go very deep. Its dissection of society is shallow and its political correctness feels very corporate. I think this movie‚Äôs main problem is lack of depth in general

-The movie is not very funny. Its whole sense of humor reminds me of Mark Zuckerberg trying desperately to appeal to people and make his products seem cool and with the times

-The pacing is awkward and the plot is just all over the place. Things happen randomly and are never touched on again. That is objectively just not good filmmaking. 

-The movie is backed by corporations. It‚Äôs not any different from Kendall Jenner‚Äôs Pepsi commercial and I can‚Äôt believe people are buying into it. It has such strong ad vibes that it starts to feel like a propaganda movie for capitalist America. It has the same sense of zany silliness as a Progressive Flo commercial

That‚Äôs all I can think of right now. I know I didn‚Äôt do a great job organizing my thoughts I‚Äôm just putting them out there in random order. The only good thing ab the movie to me was that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are good at acting",2023-08-14

Bad pacing, humor was dry and sporadic, plot and theme took a 180 every few minutes, the CEO guy and his officers were gag inducing. Weird characters like Allen and the office worker. There was a semblance of plot. The character development was slow/non existent then sped up to 100. Props for trying something different but poorly executed",2023-07-22
"People called me crazy two years ago when I said that not only was this going to be the highest anticipated film of the year, but that it was actually going to be good!

  



This movie was everything you'd expect while also being nothing you'd expect. I know it's stereotypical to call movies that seem to be aimed at kids to not actually ""be for kids,"" but trust me; this film is way more for adults who have had ENOUGH!

  


  


As a man, who likes to believe he's a feminist, and very progressive, this film still made me very uncomfortable at times and I mean that in an EXTREMELY positive way. This movie is going to make a LOT of men upset and I for one, cannot wait!

  


  


""Barbie"" is on the nose at times while also being very subtle other times, and both moments hit their marks in my opinion.

* Best Makeup

  


* Best Art Direction

  


* Best Costume Design

  


Oscars It Will Be Nominated For:

  


* Best Original Song

  


Oscars That It Might Not Be Nominated For But Should:

Edit: What I'm saying is, though the movie is making a point about the real world...In universe can the Ken's ever really find happiness and meaning in a world that quite literally wasn't meant for them? I mean it's literally Barbieland I don't think the Ken's can hope for much equality, maybe eventually. Plus it did seem like the Barbie's were perfectly fine without Ken that's something to consider. Wouldn't the Ken's be happier in their own ""Kendom"" finding meaning, and riding horses?

Had funny moments. But I agree with a lot of people that the message was lost. It was basically saying the Barbie world needs to be run by women only. That men need to rise up the way women had to in the real world. Shouldn't a stronger message be that it shouldn't be men vs women but gender equality?,2023-07-31

"The movie practically talks indirectly to the audience the whole time through its use of humour. It takes itself just the right amount of serious. 

Also, for a movie so unapologetically ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù, I‚Äôm happy that it 1) didn‚Äôt do a romance ending and 2) didn‚Äôt validate men‚Äôs issues. 
As a guy, it was uncomfortable to watch at moments because it just eviscerates men‚Äôs complaints about the world they built. To then go back on it and do an angle about ‚Äúbut Ken‚Äôs problems are serious too!‚Äù would negate the whole breakdown they did on masculinity.",2023-07-21
greta gerwig just understands women. through and through,2023-07-21
"Loved it. When Ken entered the real world and saw how it‚Äôs run FOR men, I almost cried! I just felt so validated haha. Ryan Gosling was awesome. 

A few misses for me though:

-it REALLY bothered me when Barbie apologies to Ken in the end. Why do women always apologise? Ken didn‚Äôt apologise to her and he kicked her out of her home‚Ä¶ but then I thought if the roles were reversed and it was the guy ‚Äútaking Barbie for granted‚Äù we‚Äôd have wanted him to apologise. All she did wrong was not like him romantically. What do we think about this?

-I did not get at all the speech Ken made in the end about ‚ÄúI am Ken‚Äù. How about like: ‚ÄúI can cry! I dont have to have amazing abs (even though I do)‚Äù Could‚Äôve been an opportunity to call out toxic masculinity in a funny way. I think this was a slight miss. The speech didn‚Äôt land with me, nor my male friends I saw it with.

-I just didn‚Äôt get the Will Ferrell character jokes. I got at first he was an antagonist but then we didn‚Äôt see him at all the rest of the movie‚Ä¶ Barbie wasn‚Äôt worried about him in Barbie land or anything. I think he got lost. 

Overall though, it was a hard thing to do. Make a serious but funny but light but for all ages movie that touches on Barbie and the patriarchy. What did we think about the last gyno joke? It was nice‚Ä¶ I mean going to the gyno is one do the most profoundly women things we can do, but I wonder if it could‚Äôve been better.

Side note: I just like picking movies apart, doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt love them.",2023-07-21

"im just preparing myself for critics saying that the messaging is too on the nose. Don't Look Up got that feedback and I'm just like.. do yall know this is satire? it is supposed to be over the top

anyways, loooove it and it's the comedy of the year for me",2023-07-21
"I dunno I guess I'll be called an incel and manbaby for this, but it felt like this movie spent a lot of time bashing men and didn't give them much in return, while it spent minimal time bashing women (even when they maintain a toxic matriarchy) and gives them plenty of catharsis and sympathy in return.

* Men in the real world are *all* sexist and evil to an extreme degree



* Men in Barbie world pre-Kennification are 2-dimensional, put all their self worth in women and are all physically attractive to serve the Barbies. The one man (Allan) who is a more realistic depiction of an average man, is portrayed as undesirable


* Men in Barbie world post-Kennification are *all* sexist and evil to an extreme degree


* Men are given a status lower than women in the real world in the final status quo


* Ken being in love with Barbie and putting all his self worth in her giving him attention is played as a joke, when that's the exact harmful behaviour the movie is trying to destroy for women. Yes this is resolved at the end, but it's not given much attention and it's played off as a problem Ken has caused for himself.


* The monologue for Barbie is very explicitly aimed exclusively at women, when a lot of what is said applies to men too (see above). I don't know why they didn't give men the same catharsis and highlight that men struggle with elements of our current society too. It's almost played off that only women can feel anxiety, for example.


* When women realise the patriarchy is bad, they use complex language and are shown as extremely emotionally intelligent. When men realise the patriarchy is bad, they say ""I... good?"", while the female characters cheer and say ""yay, you good - well done"". It feels quite condescending.


* The one non-sexist male character (the dad), is given the classic ""stupid dad who's unaware of what's going on and everyone laughs at his stupidity when he talks"" schtick. Not exactly a healthy stereotype.

* Women are frequently shown to be emotionally intelligent and very socially aware. The only time they're not, is when they've been literally brainwashed (basically saying ""don't worry women, if you feel like your behaviour has contributed to the current state of society - it hasn't! You were just brainwashed). The men are *always* portrayed as emotionally stupid and fall into dumb stereotypes at the jingle of some keys. They have to have societal problems explained to them by women. They are not given the ""we were brainwashed"" excuse, even though men are raised into society in the exact same way women are, and women maintain harmful elements of society much like men do.

* On that note... why is Barbie world being a matriarchy presented as an innocent mistake by the Barbies, but when it switches to patriarchy - it's a malicious and intentional brainwashing by the Kens?


* It's seen as a joke and positive thing that men can be gaslit and emotionally abused


I want to take this movie sincerely. I feel like it's making a really important point. I could take it all as a joke, but I feel like that would be ignoring some important messages that it very clearly wants to communicate.


The problem is, when I do take it sincerely, I just feel bombarded with a very negative and pessimistic view of men.",2023-08-05
"Every male ""character"" depicted in this film is brainless and ape-like while at the same time every male in kenbieland is gay-ish and metrosexual. On the other side, every female character is ""complex"", caring and ""self aware"". How's that equal??? Where's the arc in just ONE male character? And the mother-daughter subplot was waaaay too cringey and unrealistic. The film tries so hard to push a social agenda in minors and it does it in the cheapest way possible. Overall, awful and unethical.",2023-07-22

One example is movies from malayalam film industry, if you theese movies you will understand how beautiful and artistic films can be .

"Alan was the only average looking man in Barbieland, and was the butt of the joke constantly, having a brief moment fighting the Kens only to go back to being a placid butt of the joke. Meanwhile the ""average"" looking girls in Barbieland were full fledged barbies and the only one that was really the butt of the joke was the pregnant one, Midge and then the ""average"" barbie idea was some idea that'd make tons of money. It felt off to have Barbies be very diverse but then the Kens were all conventionally attractive in shape men and the one who wasn't didn't even get to be Ken and was mostly just a joke.",2023-07-29

"There's wayyyyyyy too many directions this movie could've gone and instead of picking one or two, it got greedy.


The nihilistic jokes regarding gender roles just didn't fold into the story that well. Totally killed the momentum of the America Ferrera storyline with her daughter. 
Definitely took the emotion outta some pivotal scenes. Like there was very clearly a choice made in the cutting room where jokes were prioritized over the overall narrative. 


That musical scene with Gosling was such bs. It was the exact type of camp I was looking forward to see in the film....and they gave us such a tiny morsel.


Overall, I blame the fact that no one would sit down for a three hours barbie movie for all of this.",2023-07-30
Horrible movie didn‚Äôt even finish it,2023-07-31
"Can someone explain how the way the film treated ~~Allen,~~ Gloria's husband *wasn't* man-bashing?

I really appreciated Ken's arc within the film. He feels like his life is empty so he latches onto the patriarchy as a way to find purpose within his life. In a world where the men are simply regarded for their looks (a parallel of the real world but for women), it makes sense that he would take on the ideology that would make him feel important as a man.

By the end, he becomes a less toxic, more emotional man that is more in tune with his feelings. Someone who isn't only obsessed with Barbie or his looks, but someone who is able to find happiness in non-material things.

However, the way that the film handles Gloria's husband ~~, Allen,~~ seems to be at odds with this messaging.

While other examples of the Barbies being ""mean-spirited"" to the Kens could be explained with allegory, ~~Allen~~ the husband doesn't seem to be this way. The film just seems to straight up make fun of him as this weird, ""beta"" male that his wife makes fun of behind his back. ~~Allen~~ The husband is purely himself, dressing the way he wants and learning a language on Duolingo in his free time. Yet the film seems to make fun of him for it.

Gloria even mentions that she used to date this other guy who was much more adventurous because she learned how to recklessly drive with him. Going off memory:

> ""Where did you learn to drive like that?!""

> ""Well, there was this guy..."" and Gloria smiles during this.

> ""Oh, was it dad?""

> ""Uh...yeah, it was definitely your dad."" before giving a sly smile to Barbie who understands.

From my perspective, the movie is clearly making fun of ~~Allen~~ the husband while glorifying Gloria's past boyfriend. Yet this seems to be at odds with the film otherwise taking a shot at toxic masculinity and men becoming more in tune with their emotions.

Does anyone have a perspective on this? Am I missing something because, for the most part, the reputation of the film being man-bashing seems to be overblown...except for ~~Allen~~ the husband.",2023-08-03
"I just saw Barbie. It had some fun laughts, but it overall wasn't for me. The social commentaries were a  plenty and heavy handed to the point of ""we get already"", the ending did not really hit with me and there were just too many subplots. I dare say this might be the worst Ryan Gosling movie I have seen, but he tried his utmost best to carry a movie we've seen done hundred of times.   
The movie was sold as being new and inventive, but it felt like they beat a dead horse (the horse theme from Ken was weird btw) and it was sold on being a so-called Greta Gerwig movie.   
I have yet to see what makes Gerwig so special. She gets Oscar nominations, but nothing about her stands out in my opinion and her movies are at best decent and at worst Barbie. To me it feels like reviewers looks at her movies with different eyes just cause of her name. This movie could have had any other director and I can't help wonder if it would have been received with the same praise if it did.   
Is Greta Gerwig overrated and did you like Barbie?   
Do we have counter-acts to these kind of movies were the man is trying to find himself? I recall Crazy, Stupid, Love also starring Ryan Gosling btw, but that icks be now, because the wife is a horrible person and yet the movie portrays the men as in the wrong. I kind of saw that movie as a man discovering himself, but basically that movie ends with Cal not being able to live without Emilie, aka he can't be Ken without his Barbie.   
Disclaimer: I am a dude. Is it a dude thing? I won't got full Ben Shapiro on the movie, I just was underwhelmed after having looked forward to something I thought was reinventive and thought provocking, it really wasn't. Was it?",2023-09-15

This isn't a movie for men, we just need to step aside and let the women have their fun. Every woman in my life under 80 saw this or wants to see it. I wouldn't expect women to care about The Expendables or other ""manly men"" movies nor whine about how they are too masculine or whatever, so why should men complain or butt in on something like Barbie? This is a movie for girls about girls, and clearly feminism has changed the average woman's outlook and beliefs, i.e. they are not all about traditional roles, so this is a movie that's gonna make them feel good. So be it, go to town, enjoy yourselves.",2023-07-23
"The Barbie Movie wasn‚Äôt really about Barbie, or for girls who loved Barbie. Barbie was hijacked to be a vessel for Greta Gerwigs bitterness in the same way the Scooby Doo characters were by Mindy Kaling in the Velma show. 
Barbie was always empowered and could be anything or do anything since the 60‚Äôs. Ken wasn‚Äôt her enemy, Ken never held her back and it never occurred to anybody to even think that at least until someone as bitter as Gerwig came along.

"TL;DR: white feminism.  
  
Feminism is about all women. Not just privileged, white and attractive ciswomen, but also women who are neither white nor attractive, nor neurotypical, nor cisgender. Historically speaking, Barbie dolls have been uplifting and inspiring for many white and attractive ciswomen. For women who don‚Äôt fit into that mold? Not so much. To a young, fat girl who is insecure about her weight, the Barbie doll she owns at home is just a reminder to her that she does not fit conventional beauty standards. To a young, black girl who is called racial slurs by her classmates at school, the Barbie doll she has at home serves to remind her of how she is perceived by her peers‚Äîalthough she herself may own a blonde Barbie doll, her white classmates will never own a doll of a black girl.  
  
Although Mattel has recently begun diversifying their Barbies, releasing curvy Barbies, Latina Barbies, Barbies in wheelchairs, what have you, it still stands to reason that for a large portion of the Barbie brand‚Äôs history, this was not the case. Casting a black woman as the president of Barbieland does not erase the negative impacts which Barbie has historically had on black girls, Mattel. It is not even a step in the right direction, because that would mean actually acknowledging the hurt which the Barbie franchise has caused. In fact, most telling is the fact that Margot Robbie, a skinny, attractive, white woman with blonde hair, was casted as the main character. Does that not fit with our conventional idea of what Barbies are? Does that not go to show that the Barbie franchise is still synonymous with placing white women on a pedestal? How then, can Mattel pretend that the Barbie franchise does not still hurt marginalized women?  
  
Of course, that is not to say that Greta Gerwig entirely ignored the compelling argument that Barbie has been a source of pain for many women. However, this argument came from the character Sasha, who was framed as being a bratty mean girl who is overly politically correct, as well as a social justice warrior. This inevitably means that the arguments she made were not given as much weight and importance as they should have been given. I can acknowledge that Sasha playing the role of a ‚Äòwoke‚Äô SJW but eventually finding redemption was likely Greta‚Äôs attempt at arguing that although Barbie has had a negative impact on many girls, many girls have also benefitted from the franchise and found empowerment through it, and that these experiences are not mutually exclusive‚Äîwhich Sasha herself eventually realizes. But to not at least give Sasha‚Äôs initial perspective the respect it deserves by exploring it in more depth?  
  
Besides that, I was a little confused by the entire concept of establishing a matriarchal society, only to have it be overthrown by the patriarchy, only to reinstate the matriarchy once again. I‚Äôm not sure what message Greta was trying to get at with this entire subplot. Sure, I buy the argument that men use patriarchy and toxic masculinity as a cover-up for their own insecurities and as a coping mechanism, and that women are the collateral damage. Sure, the film does acknowledge that even under the matriarchy, all the Kens were oppressed relative to the Barbies. The film leans into the argument that both patriarchal and matriarchal societies are flawed. But then it pivots by a complete one hundred and eighty degrees and supports the matriarchy instead. Everything goes back to being pink, the Kens still aren‚Äôt given a complete say in parliament, and Barbieland is restored. Bizarre.  
  
While I can‚Äôt really say that I care much for the feelings of men, I definitely do take the argument raised by many viewers that by using rhetoric which bashed extensively on men, the film isolated a large portion of its potential viewer base. If anything, it‚Äôs not so much the hurt feelings of men that I see as being the big issue, but more the fact that men will be less receptive to feminism and women‚Äôs rights as a result of films such as Barbie, which will make changing misogynistic attitudes on the ground level more difficult. Certainly, films and movie series‚Äô can be highly political, progressive and feminist all at the same time without isolating its male viewers‚Äîtake Arcane by Riot Games, for instance. For a movie series which attracted a largely misogynistic viewerbase of League of Legends ‚Äòdudebro‚Äô players, it garnered extremely high reviews despite subverting gender roles, humanizing instead of sexualizing its female cast, and portraying same sex relationships. Misogynistic men have the capacity to be accepting if only we give them the chance to.  
  
For a film which poses itself as ‚Äòmeta‚Äô and ‚Äòself-aware‚Äô, it greatly lacked awareness of the full extent to which Barbie‚Äîthe literal main character‚Äîhas hurt and harmed girls. I did not find it to be feminist or even remotely helpful for the feminist cause. If anything, the film contradicted its goals. I found it to be highly invalidating towards marginalized women, and I will not be surprised to see screenshots of the Barbie film plastered all over incel communities on the internet. Really, I can only describe Greta‚Äôs feminism as ‚Äòwhite feminism‚Äô.",2023-08-01

Bad dialoge and an incohesive plot. I think I chuckled twice through the movie.  It was cringy not funny. Bad messaging. No need to cut down men to prop up woman.

"Barbie was a bad MOVIE but will make a fantastic PLAY.

All the sets would‚Äôve been more visually appealing as a play, the interaction with characters would‚Äôve been better as a play, the narrator would‚Äôve worked better as a play, the dance scenes would have worked better as a play, the songs would work better as a play.

 The overall cheesiness of the jokes and movements of the doll like people would be a great quirk for live entertainment. Narrator voice in a live theatre would be much more effective as a interactive piece. The sets that were mechanical or moved/opened into place would be magnificent as a live viewer not so much as an on screen gimmick.

First there was the Kens all being dumber than the Barbies, then it was the real world men all being dumber than the real world women (like Gloria who actually had better ideas than men but were held back by the ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù), then it was Gloria‚Äôs dumb husband getting mocked by his daughter while his wife rolls her eyes, then Gloria is talking about some other dude (not husband) teaching her to drive and laughing about how lame her husband is, then the Kendom, despite the Kens supposedly being the equivalent of real world women and the oppressed class, is portrayed negatively while all male interests are mocked and were supposed to root for the protagonist and oppresser Barbies to beat the Kens - and why shouldn‚Äôt we? After all the Kens are morons who don‚Äôt really want to rule anyway and the Barbies are clever and competent. 
Then it‚Äôs Ken breaking down and crying while being given the message that it‚Äôs ok for men to cry - and yet the scene is played for laughs at a man crying. Then while Ken is crying and telling Barbie he loves her, she explains life to him like an idiot and tells him he now gets to find himself (this is supposed to be a happy ending?). Then it‚Äôs the Barbie Land going back to a matriarchy as a real world parallel, except it‚Äôs not a real world parallel because as I‚Äôve said, the Barbies are competent and clever like all the female characters, whereas the real world patriarchy is stupid and incompetent. If the Barbies were obviously portrayed negatively like real world men it might be, but they are not, the Kendom is.
 
It‚Äôs the relentless ‚Äúman dumb, woman smart and good and woman needs to re-educate the dumb man‚Äù trope that runs through the movie, it‚Äôs even small side characters like Gloria‚Äôs husband being mocked and cast as morons for no narrative reason, it‚Äôs the close examination of everything supposedly toxic about men and the lacking examination of women - although actually the movie unselfawarely reveals a lot of toxic female thinking such as the dismissal of Gloria‚Äôs husband as a joke, the playing off the Ken crying scene for laughs while simultaneously giving the message it‚Äôs alright for men to cry and the overall want to characterise men as dumb and incompetent - oh and only less stereotypical men such as Allan being shown as good, yet also playing up his weirdness for laughs.

Any one of these things alone is nothing, just a harmless joke at the other gender. But so many of them together add up to a lot of bitterness about men. And Greta Gerwig has revealed that she has more contempt for men than she would care to admit with this script Imo.

And to those saying I shouldn‚Äôt be so serious about a toy doll movie, then tell all those praising it‚Äôs themes and messaging to shut up and not take a dolly movie so seriously as well or else it‚Äôs just a lazy attempt at dismissing opinion.",2023-07-30
"It‚Äôs not men hating, but it sure as hell dumb most of the time, they try to play it out like satire, but that generates more plot holes for the story and the forceful comedy by Will Ferrel and his gang, wasn‚Äôt helping the film in any way. It has like 5-10 minutes of worthful moments of message, which you can just watch on YouTube with compilation. There‚Äôs seriously no need to watch it again from start to end. 

It‚Äôs massively overrated for that reason",2023-08-10

My favourite part was the dad trying to learn Spanish and getting shat on by his teenage daughter. Honestly that character was just as much of a bully even after what should have been a redemption when she convinced her mum to drive back. I think a teenage girl calling barbie a fascist was a real testament to how much women tear other women down. Best piece of social commentary when we took a break from dunking on men.,2023-07-23

"I understand the surface level of feminism to be digestible to every audience.

It‚Äôs a terrible message to young girls !! ‚ÄúBe nice to men and they won‚Äôt be misogynistic‚Äù like what‚Ä¶ I also think the movie focuses on Ken‚Äôs feelings, which isn‚Äôt wrong but once again, saying that Ken did all of this ‚Äújust because he‚Äôs hurt‚Äù is somewhat implying that misogyny or patriarchy exist because women are too rude to men and don‚Äôt care about them enough.

"Worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Wasted $20 to see more leftist propaganda. Women already have as much opportunity as men. The mindset that this movie promotes is one of victimhood and blame. Most good men do not want to take advantage of women; they are instinctual providers and want to take care of their wives and children.

"I've never seen a film that's so heavy-handed with its messaging before in my life! That scene where America Ferrera literally monologues a speech directly to the audience was cringe to say the least.

Awful with extremely heavy handed feminist messaging. Can't believe this is the highest grossing film of this year - the masses sure are led around like sheep, anything that is hyped they think is great!

Only positive I can think of was the relatively high production value, though Oppenheimer was still much better in this regard.

The Barbie Fantasy World is a good representation of the overall Pop Culture Fantasy World created Post-WW2 to escape the Oppenheimerverse(Reality) where nuclear war and human extinction are as inevitable as a biological weapon leaking from a government lab, intentionally, or unintentionally is of no real consequence. the result is the same. So the people create ideas like patriarchy, and political ideology to escape the uncomfortable fact that a powerful minority of humans will always dominate the majority until the hubris of the global oligarchy gets everyone killed. They believe they‚Äôll be able to survive in their expensive bunkers and begin to believe there‚Äôs an acceptable level of nuclear exchange between nations, until escalation begins as is the nature of war.",2023-07-24

"Please don't take me down for this.

I haven't been this angry at a movie for a long while. The last time I was this angry at a movie was when the new Star Wars trilogy came out. But I was only angry at the new Star Wars movies because of silly nerd rage. I'm angry at Barbie because it is blatant hate speech, and it deserves all of the anger I can possibly muster.

The Barbie movie portrays men as dull-witted frat bros who want to terrorize women and take over the world, but are too dumb to lead. It portrays absolute gynarchy as an ideal society, and a perfect world being a world where men are enslaved and only women can lead.

Watching this movie, this scathing objectification of men, excavated a long-lost memory of my childhood from deep within my subconscious.

I was in 4th grade, and I wanted to watch cartoons on my mom's laptop. I lazily looked up ""cartoons"" and the first thing that came up was a laundry list of videos of old-fashioned cartoons. I clicked on the first one I saw that had a character that looked like me.

A title popped up. ""Merrie Melodies"". Then, another one. ""Jungle Jitters"".

I then watched scenes of stupid cavemen, screaming jibberish and dancing in circles. They were all Black. I stared at the scream dumbfounded, my mouth agape, eyes wide open as the screaming cavemen jumped through their nose-rings and waved around sticks.

These characters weren't me, I thought to myself. I'm not stupid. I don't yell nonsense, swinging a stick through the air. But I was on that laptop. I wasn't smart like the White characters, or the diabetic honey-addicts, or the talking fucking mice. No. I was an idiotic savage, and the coyote who couldn't form a basic, working plan was leagues ahead of me.

I remember being absolutely livid at those dancing savages. I wanted to grab the drum they oh-so happily danced on and beat them over the head with it. It wasn't funny to me like it was to the kids in the 1940's. To me, it was a brutal mockery of what I was.

I slammed that laptop shut so goddamn hard I'm surprised I didn't break the thing. I suppose they just made laptops different back then.

It was on that day, I truly realized what racism really was. To me, I'm just a regular guy. To the men who made that cartoon and to all the little boys and girls who were fed lies about their fellow humans by watching it, I was a backwards dimwit. And that was all I was and all I would ever be.

Racists, sexists, homophobes and other extremists aren't born. Nobody is pushed out of the womb, swastika tattoo smack-dab on the back of their little head. Extremists are made, and this movie is the fucking recipe. This movie is pure evil, teaching children that women are perfect, high-born leaders and men are uncivilized brutes that women have to babysit, lest they destroy the world. It is cut from the same cloth as that old, racist cartoon I saw as a little kid, and it is doing the same thing. Putting people in boxes, what the modern Left absolutely loves to do. Black people are either savage, backwards idiots or damsels in distress needing to be saved from their oppressors, depending on who you talk to. All men are brutish, misogynistic rapists, and all women are basically high elves.

Most members of the KKK never really knew a POC. Most were raised in small, all-White towns, and their knowledge of people of color was based on what racist Whites told them. They were brainwashed to become racist by their White friends, White family, and all-White community telling them that people of color were all exaggerated strawmen that only bring crime and drugs.  


When I watched that cartoon, I saw what extremism truly was. Putting people in boxes and reducing them to hideous mockeries. Mutilating entire groups into twisted strawmen to use as punching bags. Brainwashing children with sick ideas that they are either superior or second-class. And that is exactly what this movie does. Barbie is extremist, hands down.

This movie is brainwashing women to hate men, just like how KKK members were brainwashed, and just like how '40s kids were brainwashed. This movie is brainwashing men to hate themselves and consider themselves lesser than women, and we wonder why the incel movement is skyrocketing in membership.

We should boycott this movie and call it out for what it is: blatant hate speech. A recipe for rampant sexism and radical feminism that should be burned to the ground and never copied down ever again. We should teach our children to accept everyone for who they are, not make them acolytes for the cult of identity politics where you are either a ""victim"" or a strawman oppressor. We teach our kids that racism is wrong. Why are we teaching them that sexism is right?",2023-07-25
So Barbie is a smash hit and Grey Gerwig has really normalised and brought back mocking the other gender as dumb for laughs. A whole generation of boys will see women loving this and now think it‚Äôs acceptable for them too. So I guess we‚Äôre gonna get a whole lot of Bond style bimbo female characters in future and a lot more Dumb men bad characters. Great.,2023-07-28

"The beginning (little girls destroying the dolls): ""if the visual metaphor of little girls happily destroying the embodiment of motherhood to focus their lives instead on a shallow and materialistic piece of consumerist trash is lost on you, then I don't know what to say man, but you're probably the target audience for this movie."" sums it up.. 

the movie just shows and amplifies how women suffer nowadays, bullshit, it overexaggerates that.. a whole lot actually. Its more of a satire which targets toxic femininity and toxic masculinity and I hate it. I believe it just serves as another divisive tool to sow hatred and anger between sexes. The movie literally shoves it into your face how awful the patriarchy is. What patriarchy, none of the women in my proximity have experienced any consequences of patriarchy, my female friends especially shit on this movie and see it for what it is. Just an attempt to shit mostly on men and paint the idea for the women and girls that they live in a world where men will exploit them, which is bullshit. Truth is anyone with power is going to exploit you, men or women. And women have just as much power nowadays as men do. The fact a chick was in lead of this movie shows how ""little"" she has and how oppressed she was when being in lead of this movie.

The success of all my female friends and coworkers who are women of great quality and ambition whom I respect very much disprove this movies messages at large. It just shows that women are being hunted day till dawn, theyre being exploited, its like a feminists wet nightmare, whered you have to cry and shit yourself with how much of a victim you are, which just isnt the real world. Sad thing is a whole lotta females actually think this is how the world is and instead of taking responsibility (which is a nightmare term for your typical feminist) for their actions, they yet again blame the men. I hate how effective it is at shifting young females perspective of the world by offering them a sympathy in the shape of supporting their victim mindset with this shit of a movie. Plus they all miss the toxic femininity and that Barbie is a bitch who manipulates, is selfish and uses Ken for attention, them hoes of feminists would even tell you its good and empowering. 

The best thing you can do is take this movie for what it is. A satirical overexaggerated movie targeting modern toxic femininity and masculinity. Just take it as a comedy rather than looking for deeper political meaning behind it, cuz it really strives far from reality. Id give it a 5/10 just for the looks and the acting but the message is boring and divisive, its nothing new, toxic men are shit, toxic women rock and so on.",2023-07-29

"Barbies weren‚Äôt actually manipulated. Kens started to dominate them, like in earlier days men used to do to women. They assigned them roles. Barbies knew exactly what was happening. On the other hand, Kens were sometimes manipulated into fighting each other off, only because all the beautiful girls were switching them with one another. In actual sense, they should be throwing party, if they were so influenced by patriarchy. 

In actual world, men supported women h their voting rights because some of them were sympathetic to their situation. So, if all the Barbies just talked to Kens about their issues, then all the unnecessary fighting and manipulation could‚Äôve been cut off. Also, there was absolutely no need for Will Ferrel‚Äôs character. Story would‚Äôve functioned just the same. Barbie goes to real world, finds the girl, resolves her issues and so forth. When Barbie finally came to Barbieland, then why the hell was Will Ferrel doing there. You didn‚Äôt wanted her in real world, then what more do you want to do in that world? Add more forceful comedy to an already boring movie? For sure.

And finally, being a pro women only propaganda film just makes the film to be full of leftist ideologies.

"It was a movie.

My review isn't great, because I was pretty drunk whilst watching it, but the stupidity of the movie did a 180 that made it enjoyable.

Not really the man who likes talking about feminism and all of it, but the way it over dramatized all of it made me giggle a lot.

I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as if I went in it sober, but I am also not the intended audience for it.",2023-07-22
"This movie, like so much of modern American media (Twin Peaks, Stranger Things, Fallout series, Bioshock series and so on), falls deeply into the tired cliche of American Gnosticism.

The movie perpetuates the idealization of Barbieland, an idyllic and superficial world reminiscent of the 1950s, representing the parable of white supremacy and (reversed) patriarchal norms. This portrayal echoes the uncanny juxtaposition of an apparent utopia that conceals deeper complexities and societal issues. While Barbie's escape to the 'real world' seemingly suggests a confrontation with reality, it ultimately reinforces the clich√© of American Gnosticism rather than subverting it.

In this movie, the 'real world' becomes a mere foil to the perfection of Barbieland, reinforcing the notion that outside of the idealized fantasy lies a stark and oppressive reality. 

To add to this, Barbie's transformation from a one-dimensional character in Barbieland to an empowered advocate for change in the 'real world' follows the predictable arc often seen in American Gnostic narratives where the protagonist stumbles upon the rather obvious to the audience hidden/secret element of the so called utopic society that essentially tears down the facade. This linear trajectory undermines the depth and complexity that could have been explored in her character development.

The movie's portrayal of the 'real world' as an uncomplicated and monolithic representation of patriarchy and sexism oversimplifies the complex issues that exist in society. It misses an opportunity to delve into the diverse struggles and experiences faced by individuals within patriarchal systems and reinforces a reductionist approach to societal critique.

Barbie movie is American Gnosticism, it becomes apparent that it adheres to the same tired clich√©s seen so much these days. The idyllic portrayal of Barbieland, the escape to an equally one-dimensional 'real world,' and the linear character transformation all contribute to the perpetuation of American Gnostic themes rather than providing a truly nuanced critique of societal issues.

Did I enjoy the movie? Eh. The Barbie movie, while attempting to explore themes of escaping from an idealized world to confront harsh realities, ultimately falls into the clich√©d portrayal of American Gnosticism. It misses the opportunity to challenge the tropes and offer a more complex and thoughtful examination of the real-world issues it seeks to address.",2023-07-26

"I found the overall message of the movie to be poor. For a movie that is supposed to make woman look good, all it did was make woman look bad. The fact that none of the women genuinely care about men and just look at them as power seekers, is distressing. All the men wanted were to care about the women and be in relationships, and the women just viewed them as ego maniacs for control. And the fact that that wasn't shown as a joke, is the scariest part.

The men are the people who want to connect with others and build relationships, and the woman are really the ones who want to boost their egos and feel powerful. Which is what the women were claiming to fight against

I did like how it showed that the men just went fucking crazy because none of the women genuinely cared about them. And at the end, the message is everyone should just focus on themselves and not care about each other? Thats a shit message",2023-08-12

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre feminist and I‚Äôm all for equality among all genders, but why do you seriously have to manipulate kids with your own personal ideologies and agendas, which by the end of the film, just showed that all men were just dumb and idiots, who ended up following what Barbie wanted them to do.

"Even besides propaganda, the movie is so dumb. You could rip apart the whole movie easily, you don‚Äôt have to be that smart to even figure out all the plot holes, after every 5-10 minutes. 

At one point, when Barbies start to switch Kens, their solution, instead of thinking that Barbies are manipulating them or being weird, is to fight each other. I mean, you all have women switching with you, being nice to you, then why would you all be fighting each other? GOD! 

So, Kens decide to fight each other, but with two groups, one led by Gosling and another by Liu. 

WTF? How did they even decide who wants to fight who? What if the ones they want to fight are on the same group as them and the ones they have no problem with are on the other side, but no; just run at each other without thinking and all of this is happening, while the dude is singing about feeling neglected by Barbie. WTF? Why would he sing about Barbie or anybody while fighting another guy? And then sparkles happens, dancing happens and suddenly they‚Äôre united without any reason whatsoever. What the hell is going on here?

"Barbie: A Movie for Children? It Seems the Answer is ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs review the evidence:

Point #1: The Barbie toys are intended mostly for girls between the ages of three and six. Analysis: True.

Point #2: 13-year-olds are children. Hopefully nobody can disagree with this. We can all agree that being rated PG-13 does not mean it‚Äôs for adults. Teenagers are children. Conclusion: True.

Point #3: Teenagers have just as much nostalgia for Barbie as adults. The sales charts seem to suggest that Barbie has been maintained as a successful brand over these past decades. Answer: True.

Point #4: It is infantilizing to this country to take the Barbie movie seriously and to be either for or against its supposed political agenda. Opinion: True.

Closing thoughts:

The Barbie movie is not meant for 45-year-old millennial stoners to be crowding the theater to see and you might be ruining the experience for the children who wanted to see it. Additionally, if you were offended by its ‚Äúwoke‚Äù agenda or whatever, you are the most pathetic person in the history of the universe. The End.",2023-08-01

"Is the Snyder Cut joke odd to anybody else, considering that Gerwig and Baumbach are both ‚Äúauteurs‚Äù who are also engaged in making a movie for Warner Brothers based on corporate IP? I get that the joke is mostly aimed at the toxic fanboy thing, but the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù was largely to honor a director‚Äôs singular vision in the face of corporate decision making. 

I liked Barbie, I have no love for ‚ÄúSnyder bros.‚Äù Just a thought that popped into my head, and the joke feels a little mistuned",2023-08-03
"The thing about the Barbie movie isn't that any one joke at mens expense is bad or that any one bad portrayal of men is terrible, that's fine, you know I‚Äôm sure that girlfriends have made lighthearted jokes about action movies or whatever - it's not that - it's that there's a joke about this thing that men like, and another one, then this thing that men like is also dumb - and there's this dumb male character, then the next male character is a dumb villain and the next and every man in the damn thing.
So it's the totality of every single man being dumb and every single male interest mocked that is the problem.

I think Greta Gerwig really had a lot of bitterness about men and a complex about them and used this movie to puke it all over the screen. 
You know if this was just about bitterness toward the way women are treated sometimes or patriachy - even if I didn't agree with the point she was making - ok that's fine - but it's far more than that - it's every single male character being made a joke often for no plot reason - it's just bitterness against men on the whole as a gender.

Barbie is basically the equivalent of a racist old cartoon but about men.,2023-07-25
"First of all, I am super excited about watching the Barbie movie. Growing up, the girls always got to play with really pretty and customizable Barbie dolls while the boys at the kindergarten got... well, cars and guns :( and I'm not a big fan of either. I prefer swords and the subway.  
  
Anyway, back to the actual topic. My bestie has seen the film and spoilers, she told me that the Barbies live in a matriarchy?!? I am super excited to see that tbh. It's not something that exists in our world and I'd like to see what that's like. Hopefully, many men will see this and empathize more with women. Now, the actual topic I'd like to discuss (admittedly without having seen the movie and I will post again once I have) is the topic of representation in Barbie.  
  
Now, I've taken a look at the cast and there are numerous Barbies and Kens. To no one's surprise the 'main' Barbie and Ken are white, blonde and blue-eyed, which is fine since they were originally created as toys for white children. Of course, from the 80s (?) onwards, more diverse barbies and kens came into being in order to better represent the children all over the world who would be playing with them.  
  
In the film, we have Margot Robbie as main Barbie (white Australian), Kate McKinnon as 'Weird' Barbie (queer is a synonym for weird and McKinnon is a lesbian, idk if that's intentional but I think it's.... interesting), Issa Rae as President Barbie (Issa Rae is African-American and Black, and Obama was the first black president of the US and also, African-American in a similar way: African dad, American mom), Alexandra Shipp as Writer Barbie (Shipp is mixed: black dad, white yoga teacher mom, which I guess is as white as white gets?), Emma Mackey as Physicist Barbie (French-Brit, white, also Margot clone lol), Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie (she's Jewish), Sharon Rooney as Lawyer Barbie (scottish, white, I'm guessing she's plus size represenation), Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie (Kayne is Filipino Jewish, hispanic and asian representation perhaps?), Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie (she's English-Indian), Dua Lipa as Mermaid Barbie (white, Abanian-English, also popstar), Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie (white, Irish), Mette Towley(?)/Narrative as Video Girl Barbie (Towley/Narrative is mixed-race), Marisa Abela as Teen Talk Barbie (Abela is Maltese-Libyan Brit, Libya is an Arab country while the Maltese language is derived from Arabic, so she's roughly Arab representation) and Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie (white, English-American). So, among the barbies we can see a fair bit of representation although there is no obvious hispanic or asian representation! There are a bunch of white barbies though and some of them could've been asian or hispanic instead.  
  
As for Kens, we have 8 of them of which 5 are white, 1 is black, 1 is mixed race and 1 is asian. There is no Indian Ken and no Arab Ken. Frankly the representation for Kens is appalling and it really frustrates me that once again, while there's Asian representation there's no Indian representation the moment any romantic connotations are involved, because after all, Kens are Barbie's romantic counterparts. So, once again, we have many ethinicities of women and a bunch of white men, two black men and a token Asian guy, only becuase he was portrayed as hot in that one TV show and that one MCU movie.  
  
So, for now it seems that while Greta Gerwig is a feminist, she still is just another white woman.  
  
I'm still excited for the movie, and I'll be back with my thoughts after watching the film too.",2023-07-25

""How did this get made?"" 

""What the actual fuck?"" 

""Who greenlit this?"" 

""Will all Barbies come with vaginas now""

""Did she HAVE to go to a gynecologist at the end? She couldn't have gotten a job as head of Mattel, her first priority was her pussy?? ""

""What was even the point of the husband?""

""Blonde Barbie"" is a dumb, shallow mean girl who can't get along with ""weird Barbie"".  Ridiculous.  I suppose Barbie can be whoever you want her to be, but it makes you wonder how Greta sees women in general.  I'm surprised Mattel put their name on this film at all.  Mattel is more or less saying that stereotypical Barbie, the Barbie that started it all, is inherently a you know what:  she's dumb, vapid, treats Ken bad, just an all around BAD character.

If you are a guy, don't go to the cinema, wait for the digital release and watch it once

Yikes, nice set for barbie land and good humour for me personally with Ryan Gosling. This movie felt antagonising if you are a guy to the point of no constructive place for women and men co existing. It also reminded me of kill monger in black panther, but to be honest even that movie was less political than this was, but did feel like it was also this therapeutic release of anger for women

It will be interesting to see how this movie is received both critically and financially. The only reason I would recommend guys watching this at some point is to maybe understand how women are feeling and were the culture is at

It took a massive shot at Stanley Kubrick and thats the only thing that really got me a little bit.

"My favorite genre: the movie that thinks it's much smarter than it is.

I like a Notorious RBG mug or T-shirt.  My wife has several.  But I definitely don't need two hours of it onscreen.  And I hasten to note that I have seen both the RBG documentary and the dramatized biopic *On the Basis of Sex*, and liked them quite well.  But that's because they were not just endlessly serving up context-free feminist bromides.  They explored both RBG herself and the issues she fought for in a deeper and more nuanced way.  Even if they verged toward hagiography at times, they generally featured rich characterization and much more thoughtfulness than what Gerwig and Baumbach have dumped onto the screen here.  Which is unfortunate, as did really like their previous collaboration on *Frances Ha*.

I don't care if the authorial philosophy is feminism, or environmentalism (Apple TV's *Extrapolations*), or libertarian individualism (*V for Vendetta*).  It's not about the ideology itself and how much I might agree or disagree with it.  When you use characters as mouthpieces to recite earnest bromides unmoored from the plot or any organic character development, but very familiar to any educated person, you have failed to create anything I'm going to be interested in.  The delight others may get from that strikes me as little more than the Leo DiCaprio pointing meme: ""Hey, look at that: I am familiar with that philosophy and share its tenets...and now an onscreen character is reciting its precepts.

Stupid ass movie that promotes man hating and this delusional idea of feminism. You know there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a woman wanting to stay at home and not be a career woman right?

Edit: keep the downvoted coming lol y‚Äôall so privileged it‚Äôs unreal but yes keep thinking feminism is the answer and promoting ‚Äúmen‚Äù acting like babies",2023-07-22

"Havent seen it yet but I heard it has some sort of pro feminist message. Which is ironic since Barbie has been accused of portraying unrealistic body images.

Not hating on the film I'm still looking forward to it. I just hope I wont be rolling my eyes.",2023-07-21
"I liked the way it mocked feminist and patriarchy tomfoolery. I loved the cinemetography, costumes, dances, and casting. I loved the jokes. Unfortunately at the end I got really creeped out and sad by the girls telling the dolls to be fake to get out of their trance, the ""emotional montage"" of girls growing up (felt jarringly out of place for a slapstick comedy but appropriate for a propaganda piece), and worse of all the emotional manipulation the Barbies did. Haven't seen a hero do something so villainous since Batman tried to murder an innocent frozen woman in Batman Forever and by the end of the film I was legit creeped out. Why is Barbie going to the gynecologist when she isn't even going to use it  (have sec with a man) bc it's almost like she's incapable of love (other then of her owner).",2023-07-23

"Rocky 1976 promotes toxic masculinity

I just saw the Barbiƒó movie and realized that Rocky shows many signs of toxic masculinity. 

1. Blocks Adrian when she tries to leave on their first date. 

2. Pursues a career of violence with boxing. 

3. Kicks Paulie‚Äôs ass, who is an old man, when he could have de-escalated the situation. 

4. Persuades the youth to look up to a violent fighter. 

I could go on but these are just some of the ways Rocky resembles everything wrong with the way men are portrayed in Hollywood.",2023-07-23

Barbie builds up into these thought provoking questions. It's targeted towards a mixed audience. Even though I came out of Barbie with a lot of questions, Oppenheimer really had my brain worked up. I'd rather end with that so I can more easily separate the two features.

Wasn't Amy Schumer originally cast in the role? That explains a lot,2023-07-23
"No, it was when Gloria assured Barbie she was beautiful and perfect. The narrator implied that Margot was not the best casting to exemplify the epitome of beauty.

Which I thought damn, she really let herself be roasted for a pretty funny joke.",2023-07-22
"I think that was my favorite joke, though there were so many good ones!",2023-08-13
That was a genius touch.,2023-08-28
That was amazing lmao.,2023-10-01
"In a similar vein The Godfather cameo was really funny too. I especially loved that the Ken said the exact same words about Robert Evans and the aesthetic sensibilities of Coppola as Greta Gerwig did when she was interviewed by Letterboxd about which movies influenced Barbie.

I literally just watched Price and Prejudice the other night. I AM depression and anxiety Barbie.,2023-07-22
I literally pointed at the screen and was howling at that part!! Felt personally called outüò≠üò≠,2023-07-21
"My cousins, grandma, and aunt had dinner last night and had the ‚Äúwho would you most want to be having dinner with us right now?‚Äù talk and my aunt immediately was like ‚ÄúCollin Firth but it HAS to be Collin Firth in Pride and Prejudice.‚Äù My cousins and I saw the movie tonight and when this part came on we looked at each other and straight up fucking died",2023-07-22
Loudest laugh in my theater.,2023-07-21
I had literally done this about 3 weeks ago so I felt very understood!,2023-07-21
Okay but I maintain that it is a MASTERPIECE,2023-07-23
They came for people with that clip.,2023-07-24
"One rainy weekend when my wife was feeling down I watched the entire BBC pride and prejudice with her.

We saw barbie in theaters together, when that bit came on we exploded with disbelief and laughter.",2023-07-23
"Me and one other woman in the theater screamed, seemingly involuntarily (can only speak for myself), at that part. I wish I had met her on the way out.",2023-07-23
LMAOO,2023-07-22
omg same,2023-07-22
"I felt kind of personally attacked there, hahaha.",2023-07-23
My wife about fell out of her seat laughing in that moment. The depression Barbie montage was REAL,2023-08-07
I have jaw pain and am obsessed with the BBC 1995 Pride and Prejudice. I feel SO called out.,2023-12-21
This is the most valid criticism of the whole movie.,2023-07-22
Lol a crouch kick with no reaction would have been funny,2023-07-23
Omg that‚Äôs the first plot hole I‚Äôve heard lol,2023-07-24
I had the exact same thought.,2023-07-22
I also don't get how can Barbie cry when there's no water in her universe,2023-07-25
"Btw, were those Ryan's real muscles or did he do a plastic torso thing like Ricardo Montalb√°n in Star Trek 2?",2023-08-28
Shut up and take my upvote lmao,2023-07-31
"I liked how they showed the mixed reaction where some people thought they looked stupid and some were like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a vibe‚Äù.

It was realistic because if I saw people out dressed like that I‚Äôd be admiring them.",2023-07-21
Most unrealistic part of the movie. No one would blink an eye in Venice Beach at how they were dressed. Would be far from the wildest looking people in Venice,2023-07-23
"""I feel admired but not oggled, and there's no undercurrent of violence at all""",2023-07-26
"The judgment on Venice Beach was the only thing that I bonked on. No one would bat an eye at that look there, and if they did, it would be compliments only",2023-07-23
I had that Rollerblade Barbie and when I saw the promo pics of them in those outfits like a year ago I knew I‚Äôd have to see the film!,2023-07-23
"Really, I thought this joke was super flat, like not offensive or anything, just like, ""gays like fashion"" stereotype joke is just boring and unoriginal now",2023-08-07
When I say I screamed,2023-07-22
LMFAOOOOOO,2023-07-23
I feel like in real life nowadays in LA they wouldn‚Äôt even stand out from the crowd with that outfit,2023-09-05
"It's so great too because the rugged cowboy had long represented the ideal masculine man (ex. John Wayne). 

Dude didn't want to subjugate women tho, he just wanted horses.",2023-07-22
"I LOVED that line! Reminds me of what someone said on the documentary about Barbie. It was along the lines of: ""having to put feminism and the self-esteem of girls on the tiny plastic shoulders of a doll is quite a burden"". Greta and Margot really got me empathizing with a doll lol üò≠",2023-07-21
loved his faux minx lining with horses,2023-07-21
Almost like Mattel was trying to make Barbie (and thus themselves) the victim,2023-07-21
"> dojo casa 

Excuse you, that is Ken‚Äôs Mojo Dojo Casa House",2023-07-21
"Ken repeating things unnecessarily because he doesn‚Äôt really understand them killed me. The foosball tables, the Mojo Dojo Casa House, the fucking double sunglasses. So good.",2023-07-22
"You have to say the full name. Mojo Dojo Casa House. Feels good, doesn‚Äôt it?",2023-07-21
I loved looking for all the superfluous Ken stuff like the three watches. Didn‚Äôt catch the extra foosball table.,2023-07-21
It was full of tiny hilarious things like that,2023-07-21
Another detail I loved was that all the Mojo Dojo Casa Houses had TV's mounted way too high up.,2023-07-23
For me it was the massive tower of guitar amps,2023-07-29
They did an excellent job of making the dojo casa look like something a rich redpill youtuber would live in.,2023-07-26
I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about it but I didn‚Äôt recognize it when I saw it but now it makes perfect sense üòÇ,2023-07-21
"I was 100% expecting Ken to shout something but didn‚Äôt expect it to be Sublime lol


Probably gonna use it from now on since my wife and I both had a blast watching this.


Ryan Gosling (everyone involved really) absolutely knocked it out of the park.",2023-07-21
"Don‚Äôt know why but this line totally got me. My friend and I HOLLERED in the cinema. If it‚Äôs stupid in a very specific way that‚Äôs my sense of humour exactly.

I‚Äôve been in a Gosling mood for a while before Barbie and this reinfected me",2023-07-21
"This triggered something super specific in my sense of humor. Easily the funniest part of the movie for me, and some of the hardest I‚Äôve ever laughed out loud for anything. No joke.

IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND SPECIFIC",2023-07-22
"Absolutely the best Ryan Gosling/Ken moment, such a beautifully random and hilarious line that caught me off guard and like other commenters are saying is the type of comedy I love too. I also always forget Gosling has comedic chops.

Will Ferrell telling the one guy not to hug him at the end. His delivery always kills me.

Margot Robbie was, not surprising, so fantastic and such a great actress and hilarious too - stoked to see her as Tank Girl üòç

I dunno, Oscar noms for Robbie and Gosling I would not be surprised. 

Overall a‚Ä¶‚Ä¶SUBLIME‚Ä¶‚Ä¶flick and will definitely nab the Pink(Blu)-Ray!",2023-07-23
This made me CRY laughing,2023-07-21
"I laughed so fucking hard at that and I was the ONLY one in the theater laughing, which just made me laugh even harder, until I was just sobbing and choking in the theater.",2023-07-21
This was the hardest I laughed the whole time. I was expecting him to scream or something but I was not expecting him to yell SUBLIME in a Broken Matt Hardy voice,2023-07-25
What part was this,2023-07-21
#SUBLIME,2023-07-24
"Probably my favourite one liner in the film, Ryan Gosling was amazing but the whole cast was as well",2023-07-23
That got the biggest overall laugh for the showing I just got out of. That line KILLED it was so unexpected and bizarre,2023-07-25
This killed me. Best joke of the movie.,2023-07-23
i didn't get this joke - was it a callback to something earlier in the movie or something?,2023-07-22
The cry of a man who‚Äôs wanted something for so long and has finally gotten it.,2023-07-30
This is absolutely entering the lexicon of my best friend and I's everyday conversation.,2023-07-22
Poor Ken was friendzoned the entire time üòÇ,2023-07-22
I‚Äôm 100% going to walk around using this,2023-07-25
"I was laughing at all the same stuff as the person next to me and we were DYING at this scene. We became buds by the end and were talking about it and how each other's laughter made it even better üòÇ I haven't experienced that much collective joy in a movie in a long time, it was awesome!",2023-08-02
I was cackling at part!,2023-08-02
"My husband and I lost it at the scene where Ken takes off Barbie's glasses and realizes she‚Äôs beautiful. I have shot-for-shot had a man do that to me, and it was every bit as cringey as you think lol.",2023-07-22
The pronunciation of the godfather joke killed ne,2023-07-21
I've been with my girlfriend for seven years now and I still felt that.,2023-07-21
"Eh, I don‚Äôt think Mattel really cares, so long as the movie makes tons of cash and the public buys all of the BarbieMovieDolls at $50 apiece, along with all the merchandise. See above thread with the Ken stuff already sold out. üòÇ",2023-07-21
Being anticaptitalist is unironically a capitalist ploy. It's how you get sweet sweet money from people who think you're so cynically self aware.,2023-07-21
"How completely unrealistic they made the ""real world""  Mattel was probably helped.  Having Will Ferrell break out the box  while holding drum sticks probably does not impact how people feel about the real company.",2023-07-23
"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a terrible idea‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will make a lot of money‚Äù

‚ÄúI love it!‚Äù",2023-07-23
Portraying themselves as lovable buffoons is almost more sinister propaganda than simply being faceless and evil,2023-07-25
That‚Äôs how they get you. Capitalist billionaires selling anti-capitalist sentiment.,2023-07-23
"Mattel has been having a Problem with Barbie becoming a negative feminist symbol so this was their way of laundering Barbie for a new generation. The critiques were all very consumer friendly, Barbie still comes out as the hero. 

Mattel won HUGE with this movie",2023-07-25
"Honestly though I think this movie is going to cause a massive shift in public opinion of Barbie, in a good way. It was such a beautifully feminist message without being preachy at all.",2023-07-22
Mattel HQ looking like the empire from andor was pretty funny. Screamed corporate misery,2023-07-24
"I feel like it gives their brand some newfound relevance though. If the movie had just been some kind of generic biopic/based on a true story (like BlackBerry or Air), I doubt it would have had this amount of impact",2023-07-24
"I wouldn‚Äôt give them too much credit, they knew the score at the end of the day

‚ÄúCapital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself, even those who would critique capital end up reinforcing it instead‚Äù",2023-07-24
Seemed like a compromise to call Mattel out in Business practices but humanize Ruth as a mother (her daughter appeared as the older woman on the bus bench so she approved it) and give her props for creating something that lived on as a woman. Have a bit of a theory it was added in later. Will Ferrell‚Äôs character said ‚Äúshe keeps an office on the third floor‚Äù or whatever as a throwaway line. but then she actually had a whole little house in there with a kitchen table. And pretty sure Rhea Pearlman didn‚Äôt interact with anyone but Margot Robbie.,2023-07-21
"They explicitly said the movie wasn't a vehicle to sell a new line of Barbies, but rather tell Barbie's story and where it fits within the bigger conversation of gender roles in America, good or bad. Which I thought was admirable.",2023-07-26
Yeah it‚Äôs tricky because part of me wants to be like ‚Äúfuck capitalism they‚Äôve calculated that the immense profit they will make out weights the minor jabs at them in the movie‚Äù but then I‚Äôm also like ‚Äúomg I need to buy a barbie!!‚Äù,2023-07-26
"I don‚Äôt think they really care, seeing as they‚Äôve a good chance of being the biggest film of the year as well as selling millions of merchandise.",2023-07-23
Eh if it makes them money and serves as a good ad for Barbie toys then I don't think they care,2023-07-24
"did you see the money it's making, no wonder",2023-07-29
"It did.

It erased the entire creation of the Barbie doll, which was to be a doll for men to perv on.",2023-07-25
"From what I understand, creatively, Mattel wasn‚Äôt involved, other than licensing the character out.",2023-07-22
"Ncuti and Emma being eachothers Barbie and Ken was all I needed. Ncuti saying ‚ÄúI miss my BARBIEEEEE‚Äù only for her to pop up with a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here‚Äù was the cutest scene. 




Connor Swindells was hilarious too, even outside of his lines, he‚Äôs always doing SOMETHING in the background.",2023-07-22
I noticed a couple Fleabag cameos too - the 2nd Mattel guy (who gets shot with the arrow) but also the FBI guy who rings Mattel is the hot lawyer!,2023-07-21
It was a very weird feeling seeing Adam talk so much for once lmao,2023-07-22
It took me so long to place Maeve! Got Adam and Eric right away and thought the same thing lol.,2023-07-21
"When i saw at the beginning credits that Emma Mackey is in, i totally expected some kind of swap-joke with Margot Robbie",2023-07-21
Emma Mackey looks like Margot Robbie and I‚Äôm guessing Ryan Gosling wanted Ncuti Gatwa to be in it,2023-07-21
I clocked this too and it was the first thing I texted my friend upon leaving the theater! üòÇ about to throw the series on for a rewatch and prep for the final season after that haha,2023-07-22
Rob Brydon was Suger Daddy Ken lol,2023-07-23
The barbieland parts were all filmed in England so it could just come down to the fact that they're all there already,2023-07-25
My guess is that one of the producers is a fan. Maybe Greta is. I definitely think that Ariana Greenblatt getting cast has something to do with her 65 costar Adam Driver being Greta's friend.,2023-07-22
I NOTICED THAT TOO AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE REASON I‚ÄôM HERE,2023-07-24
Same with Lila from Umbrella Academy for me! Had me doing the Leo pointing meme in the movie theater ü§£,2023-07-25
my head cannon is that Greta Gerwig binge watched Sex Ed while they were casting and she loved the show so she decided to cast them in the movie lol.,2023-08-10
Maybe this is all a really weird dream of Otis's.,2023-08-19
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT NOTICED!! I literally love that show and I‚Äôve always thought Emma and Margot look alike so seeing them in a movie together was uncanny lol also they all had rlly good American accents haha patiently waiting for the next season to come out üòÉ,2023-07-23
"That what I was wondering! I mean, they were all great, it was just a bit confusing.",2023-08-19
"Mine personally was when one of the Kens said I‚Äôm thinking of a bird and other Kens guess different birds and he says:

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs a peli-Ken!‚Äù",2023-07-24
"The whole movie was like American-Style Columbian Magical Realism. The only other movie I call recall that leaned in so hard into  Magical Realism was ""Sorry To Bother You"".",2023-07-24
"The underrated line, the last line of the movie: ""I'm here to see my gynecologist.

Earlier to cat-call construction workers: ""and I would just like to inform you, I do not have a vagina..we don't have genitals""  
Narrator: So she left behind the pastels and plastics of Barbie Land for the pastels and plastics of Los Angeles.  
Reassuring by others before going into doctors office: ""you've got this"", ""I'm really proud of you""

&#x200B;

Conclusion: She's going to get that vagina installed.",2023-09-04
My theater in a Jewish area burst out laughing so hard at that,2023-07-21
Kate McKinnon's face when Ferrell asked to be called mother got the loudest laugh from me I think.,2023-07-28
Maybe I‚Äôm just fucking stupid (I am) but can someone explain the Jewish friend part? I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs something to do with women (considering the moment the joke is made) or if he‚Äôs just saying ‚Äúwe are inclusive‚Äù,2023-07-22
I loved that when Barbie showed up he was just watching horses on TV,2023-07-21
[deleted],2023-07-21
"There is something about the way Gosling delivers this line with such conviction, that it absolutely takes me out.

I also think any other setting where the word patriarchy is thrown around so often would be cringeworthy but Gerwig incorporates this into her characters excellently‚ÄîKen is exactly the type of shallow himbo to throw around a word like patriarchy without knowing what the heck it actually means.",2023-07-21
I wished Patriarchy is about Horse in real life.,2023-07-21
"As a dude, same. The idea of a patriarchy is pretty boring when horses are barely involved. Takes me back to when my dad first wanted to get me into cars as a little boy and I had to tell him I was into a different kind of mustang.",2023-07-21
That was the best line. Had the giggles for ages after that.,2023-07-21
"This was the biggest flaw in the movie, that the Kens needed patriarchy to have horses. There should have already been lots of horses in Barbie land",2023-07-26
"Super late but I live in an area where old rich white dudes come to play cowboy, this line spoke to me.",2023-11-23
[deleted],2023-07-26
I didn‚Äôt understand the horses and the relation to the patriarchy.,2023-07-24
My favorite character in this movie was Ryan Gosling's torso,2023-07-22
He was so insecure while being so hot,2023-07-21
"My man didn't drink water for a month for this movie lol.  Which in a hilarious twist of irony about how difficult it is for dudes to look ""stereotypical hot""",2023-07-24
mans abs were airbrushed even more or something there was a strange shadow,2023-07-25
Seriously! My bf was fully convinced his abs were CGI lol,2023-08-03
"I couldn't stop looking at his torso, that's a lot of hard work.",2023-08-13
It's already sold out üò≠,2023-07-21
Of course it did. They'd be stupid not to capitalize on that.,2023-07-22
With some shades of the Lego Movie in there too,2023-07-23
"It gave me a ""The Good Place"" vibe too.",2023-07-24
üíØ,2023-07-22
Great comparison,2023-07-22
My headcanon is that the daughter is the girl from You Story 2 who threw Jessie away cuz the whole movie reminded me of that scene lol,2023-07-23
"That‚Äôs incredibly apt.

This feels very Speed Racer influenced as well I feel",2023-07-24
"I found it to be more like Elf, though I think Elf was done better.",2023-07-25
I watched alone. On the way to the cinema I felt silly and self conscious that I wore pink. Was really happy to see many in the theater wearing the same!,2023-07-21
"The theater I went to decorated the entire lobby in pink balloons and covered the bar in pink table covers and seemingly everyone and their mom came to see the movie in pink shirts and dresses. I didn't expect that at all, I honestly can't remember the last time theaters and the audience went all out for a movie. *Maybe* Deathly Hallows Part 2, but it's easily been a decade or more since I've experienced something like this. The overall atmosphere reminded me of Gamestop when they still did midnight launches - a bit cheesy, but also pretty fun.",2023-07-21
"It‚Äôs the first movie since Infinity War that I‚Äôve been in where the audience applauded at the end, loved it!",2023-07-21
YES! It was really just so fun seeing everyone have fun. Everyone‚Äôs energy was just so infectious.,2023-07-21
My exact experience!,2023-07-21
"Yeah, this was maybe the most fun theater experience I've had since they re-released the original star wars trilogy in 2000ish.",2023-07-22
"I went last night and I‚Äôd say about 80% of people were dressed up with most wearing pink, but there were tons of people dressed up as exercise Barbie, cowboy Barbie and a lot of kens! It was so fun! The staff were also all dressed up , the theatre was decorated and there was a signature Barbie drink.",2023-07-22
I‚Äôm so stoked we all had the same experience. It was honestly so magical.,2023-07-22
"I kept saying to my fianc√©, as we both rocked pink outfits, that there‚Äôs something magical to this movie going experience, seeing so many people dressed in pinks, bringing old Barbie‚Äôs to the theaters, so many smiles and so much excitement. I‚Äôve never been to a movie where people pseudo-cosplayed the lead like you see on tv.  Just so special",2023-07-23
I always see movies at odd times too and was excited to see this with a full theater. Heard maybe three chuckles the whole movie while I was laughing the whole time -_-,2023-07-21
It‚Äôs reasons like this that make me write off anyone that says they hate the theatre experience. It can be one of the best parts of movie watching.,2023-07-23
"Yes. My entire threater was booked out in pink, even the guys. Such a memorable experience.",2023-07-23
"Right?? My row especially was apparently ultra-invested and on-board with the whole thing. At least two ""He/She is LITERALLY ME!!""s were said.",2023-07-22
saw some ladies like that and was like 'you going to see Oppenheimer?' lol i'm just silly like that,2023-07-21
Oh it was so nice seeing just the range of people‚Äôs interpretations of Barbie Summer! Saw everything from full on cottage core Barbie to Coachella Barbie to just like a Mean Girls pink polo shirt moment Barbie.,2023-07-23
Same!!,2023-07-21
"The theatre I went to had a human sized doll box, it was SUBLIME",2023-07-22
This is why we are fighting for theaters these experiences like this are unmatched its an absolute blast especially with friends.,2023-07-24
"Oh man I am the same as you but I got the bad side of it. Had the person next to me literally take a call and be like ""I cant talk right now I'm in a movie"". I had a mom and son in front of me. The son was 6 and he didn't get the movie and just kind of cheered for the guys at the end. Had a family with a little girl behind me and the girl kept saying she needed to pee. Family shushed her a dozen times throughout the movie. A group of cackling girls on my back right that clapped and cheered in the middle of the movie and would yell shit like ""Yes girl, yes"" and omg she's just like you to her friend...etc. Anyway still loved it",2023-07-24
Saw on a Monday at noon and it was pretty full. The movie is a phenomenon.,2023-07-25
"I went today (Tuesday 2 pm). At an unpopular theater. It was packed, the lobby was packed, every seat in the theater was full and everyone was dressed up. I still can‚Äôt believe this.",2023-07-26
Saw it on tuesday at 3pm. It was still kinda packed,2023-07-25
"I loved the excitement for this movie and all the link, but I was in a different theater.  It was packed, but not a lot of good crowd reactions as I had hoped.",2023-07-25
"Glad you had a better experience than me. I went at 10:15 pm showing, where it was nothing but teenagers. They were laughing before the title card for Barbie even appeared. Then at the end when the credits started rolling and that Nicki Minaj song started playing several of them began to get up and twerk. Loved the movie, my experience watching, not so much.",2023-07-27
Unfortunately the theater I went to had a group of immature teenagers who would not stop taking through the movie :/ I tried to tune them out but towards the end they got louder and more obnoxious. Someone even yelled out loud ‚Äústfu‚Äù and they kind of ruined the experience. It‚Äôs like just stay home if you‚Äôre that annoying‚Ä¶,2023-07-27
Just came back from a packed 1:30 showing. Had a blast.,2023-08-01
Here from almost three weeks in the future. Packed theater on a Wednesday afternoon.,2023-08-10
"There honestly was not a lot of laughing out loud in the (relatively full) theater where I saw this.  I really don't care about the woke/not woke political talk around the movie but to me a lot of the jokes were just too obvious and fell flat. And actually I thought the male characters had the funniest performances (Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell, Simu Liu.) 

Just my two cents. I loved Lady Bird by Greta Gerwig :shrug:",2023-08-22
"As a big fanboy of golden age Hollywood's soundstage films, Barbie Land was a feast for the eyes. Glad they didn't use green screens.",2023-07-21
I got so excited when I saw the mermaid Barbie and Ken because I had them when I was little and I totally forgot until tonight. I used to fill up the bathroom sink and make them swim when my parents weren‚Äôt paying attention.,2023-07-21
"If you like the details, watch the 7ish minute YouTube video Architectural Digest has on the dream house. It‚Äôs incredible how much thought went into the house alone - I can‚Äôt wait to see more ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù videos",2023-07-21
Commenting late but I saw a Twitter thread that said the production team knew Barbie‚Äôs height and measured her against all her accessories and apparently she is 23% bigger than her environment? They built the sets accordingly and if that doesn‚Äôt deserve and Oscar I don‚Äôt know what does.,2023-07-27
Yea the set design was fantastic.,2023-07-23
Barbieland was great. LA scenes looks looked oddly lazy and drab.,2023-07-25
John Cena as a MermKen was a big and pleasant surprise üòÇ,2023-08-28
"During the Barbie party scene I had been thinking about how size and race inclusive all the Barbies were but they were all young. At the risk of being dramatic, the bus stop scene took my breath away.",2023-07-21
"Agreed!! Especially when she looked up to just appreciate the beauty of the trees, and we as an audience got to take them in for a moment as well. Something so everyday, yet really so beautiful when you have a chance to pause. That whole scene felt like a reminder to all of us to take a moment to breathe and appreciate all kinds of beauty that‚Äôs around us every day.",2023-07-21
"Greta said she refused to cut that scene. Even though it didn‚Äôt move the narrative along, and seemingly was a ‚Äúcul-de-sac‚Äù in the plot, she said it‚Äôs the heart of the whole movie and if it wasn‚Äôt included she didn‚Äôt know why she was even making movie. AND it‚Äôs Ann Roth the costume designer who is a legend. Fucking conviction.",2023-07-22
Sidenote that woman was legendary Tony and Oscar winning costume designer Ann Roth who probably knows a thing or two about beauty standards and the things we expect women to do to fit into them. That was some God tier meta casting. It's like if Edith Head were still alive and they put her in this movie and they probably would have.,2023-07-21
"As soon as she called that woman beautiful and smiled at her I legit started really crying. The punch line helped but it was at that moment that I was like, oh fuck, this movie is gonna get me.

I absolutely lost it at the part with Rhea Perlman at the end when they played the montage of moms and daughters with the Billie song playing in the background. Like fully crying. 33 y/o male lol.",2023-07-22
"Had to scroll way too far to see this. It‚Äôs my favorite scene in the movie and I kept waiting for the movie to top it emotionally for me. It‚Äôs totally okay that it didn‚Äôt, I still had a great time, but there was something so endearing about her just watching people existing, some having just a regular day, some clearly distraught, and turning to the woman. As Ken would say, sublime!

Also the ending ‚Äúbeing a human is uncomfortable‚Äù was a good cherry on top of this scene.",2023-07-21

"That scene was BEAUTIFUL. I know everyone is talking about Ryan‚Äôs acting (which I don‚Äôt get, he was hilarious but margot was the heart), but I FELT every single emotion Margot went through as she observed people. And the ‚Äúyou are beautiful‚Äù moment just cinched it for me. Incredible incredible scene, was sobbing through it. Margot absolutely fucking killed it, what a talent.",2023-07-22
That scene messed me up for a bit! So lovely. It really reminded me of the scene in Soul where he's playing the piano with all the mementos thinking about how 22 experienced life.,2023-07-22
"What's great about that scene is that it would typically be the climax of another film, but afterwards they had even more to think about and get emotional over. The ending montage got me emotional too.",2023-07-22

I definitely had a good cry during that scene. It was beautiful!,2023-07-22
"That was a very endearing part as well, womanhood is not defined by age nor appearance because womanhood is more than that

During my viewing a man laughed out loud in the theatre during that scene probably because the optics of how absurd it is that Barbie would call an old woman beautiful 

I just found it quite funny that of course it‚Äôs a man who misses the message and finds that sweet scene funny",2023-07-27

I wish I was high for that sequence and that it was 3 hours long and I was part of the sequence.  I wonder how many men will be inspired to do dance fights from this because it definitely awoke something in me hahaha.  That fuckin lawnmower arm pumping move they kept doing.  It was so masculine but positive.  I love that the kens learned to get along because of it,2023-07-22

"> I was so worried when Barbie first met Sasha that the movie was about to become Barbie teaching her about being more positive, etc.

  


Quite the opposite really. The movie was about Barbie learning to accept negativity. Excellent.

  


> Honestly, I thought I had this movie figured out from the trailers but it just kept swerving in the best possible ways.

  


Yeah, the trailers were pretty much just the first act of the film. Will Ferral was barely even an antagonist unlike what we were led to believe.

  


> Some light exposition and then handwaves the rest of the way, like Will Ferrell just casually mentioning that Ruth was a ghost with an office. Like, any other movie would've had the humans spend a lot more time questioning \[things.\]

  


Best type of world building honestly. If the characters just go with it, you'll just go with it. It's why Star Wars works. The Force exists because it does. We're in the past but somehow in the future but everyone else is just living their life in it so let's just watch them do it.

  


The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender has hybrid animals and elemental control but no one ever stops the plot to explain it. They live it everyday so why can't we just watch them do that? We'll catch up.

"There's definitely a lot of competition but that might've been the best joke in the movie.

Also, Ryan Gosling was fucking phenomenal in this film. Literally incredible. But there was something about how Ken was written and also shown that made me think if they didn't get Gosling, Bo Burnham would've knocked this role out of the park as well (I think it's partly to do with the childish mentality and behaviorisms that Ken had which Bo makes a lot of fun of and embraces at the same time in his comedy specials)",2023-07-21

"Eh, Mattel is pulling a sleight of hand here. Yes they‚Äôre doing the ‚Äúself aware‚Äù schtick but notice how they never really fully address the criticism that Barbie gives women an unrealistic body image. They start from the premise that she is inherently empowering. I think they mentioned it maybe once? Then moved on 

Also the few jabs at capitalism seemed very simplistic. They wanted to make a couple of jokes that showed they were hip to the kids humor but very cognizant of not venturing into any territory that would indicate the entire corporate business model being unethical 

Gerwig and Baumbach are great filmmakers (this movie was beautifully shot and some of the acting and jokes were top tier) but you can tell this thing was an advertisement and had the Mattel PR hands all over it. It‚Äôs a corporate movie after all. They‚Äôre not gonna green light a movie they feel isn‚Äôt good for their bottom line

"When I did this double feature, I think this was what I was looking for. In Oppenheimer, we truly do see the worst of humanity. The hubris, the destruction, just a, well, very sad and unhappy time. For this double feature to work, Barbie needs to refute Oppenheimer or it needs to affirm it. And I think while in many ways this films affirmed the more cynical world view of Oppenheimer, this particular scene stands out because it very quietly and respectfully refutes it. There is real beauty in the world, in humanity, and it comes in some very unexpected places. And it is that beauty which gives some justification and hope to humanity, even if that is very small.",2023-07-21
"I‚Äôm not sure if this was intentional but I think the movie also subtly called attention to the fact that even as Barbies become more diverse, they‚Äôre still always the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù representation of their type. 

Like initially I thought stereotypical Barbie freaking out about her body being damaged (flat feet) or cellulite was slightly ‚Ä¶ hurtful (?) to some of her friends, because the movie has plus size Barbies and a Barbie who uses a wheelchair.

But even a plus size doll is still plastic and smooth ‚Äî she‚Äôs still ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù Similarly a disabled doll doesn‚Äôt experience any genuine physical limitations because all dolls are manipulated around by their users. 

Dolls will always be perfect and unattainable, even as they become representative of more people. Every doll is the perfect version of herself. 

Anyways, when Barbie is in the real world, it‚Äôs her first time being exposed to flaws. But to her everyone but her is still perfect because they‚Äôre themselves. She thinks she‚Äôs the only one who isn‚Äôt exactly right ‚Äî when in reality all humans, even Margot Robbie, are flawed in some way.",2023-07-21
"It was such a breathtaking scene. I flew out to meet my two cousins this weekend partly to see this movie, but also so we could spend time with our beautiful 84-year-old grandmother. We had dinner with her last night and lunch with her today before we saw the movie. I‚Äôve been very aware the past few days of the limited time I have left with her, so this scene hit extra hard for me.",2023-07-22
"Apparently Gerwig said that scene was pivotal, and essentially the whole point of the movie, and I have to agree. That‚Äôs the moment Barbie embraced and understood humanity, on an intuitive level. And also showed her underlying positivity and empathy. I knew she‚Äôd end up becoming human at that point.",2023-07-23
"This was the best scene in the film and I really wish we had tugged at that thread more in the film vs some of the more shallow and ‚Äúeasy‚Äù hits on patriarchy and a tween daughter who thinks her mom isn‚Äôt cool. Both those themes felt very 90s in its interpretation, just dated and not saying anything new. I wish the film explored more about what life is like to age, what it means to age as a mother, what it is for a daughter to see her mother age. Why aging is a gift. Aging beautifully and happily as a woman is in itself an act of resistance against patriarchy. But we really didn‚Äôt get anything more from that vein and instead focused way more on the Kens and their Ken issues, and the gaggle of incompetent corporate goons. I did love the Kens but felt like the second half of the film definitely focused way more on them than anyone else.",2023-07-24

"That‚Äôs so so true!! I love that as well, and all the Barbies and Kens of different races and even sizes being able to just be Barbies and kens, not tied to their appearance!",2023-07-23
He is handsome af,2023-07-23
"I get it, and I‚Äôm glad too. He was a perfect Ken!",2023-07-23
It was great.  I think there coulda been more asian/indian Barbie though.  Think I may have seen a couple quick shots in the opening sequence.,2023-07-25
"I agree, Shang-Chi and Harley Quinn fanfics are probably coming LOL",2023-07-23
"I‚Äôm glad that Simu Liu as cast instead of Bowen Yang.  I‚Äôm just sick of seeing Ken Jeong and Bowen Yang-type Asian guys in movies and TV, like that‚Äôs how the average American is going to regard Asian men.",2023-07-30
He was great!,2023-07-23
"It‚Äôs worth noting that we‚Äôre discussing a movie that rebukes the pressure that girls/women feel to be sexy and attractive. Yet here we have everyone talking about how sexy and attractive Simu Liu is and how that‚Äôs a win for us Asian-American men (presumably because now we Asian-American men will be considered more attractive in society).

Jeez, we‚Äôre going to need an America Ferrera style monologue or our own to rant about the contradictory messaging we men (especially men of color) get all the time.",2023-08-05
Simu was definitely able to perfectly match the Himbo Trophy Husband kenergy to a T. That perfect mix of being a total muscle hunk but also having that kind of softness to his face that makes him less intimidating.,2023-08-14
Have you seen the [Kiss me more](https://youtu.be/0EVVKs6DQLo) music video?,2023-07-25
"It‚Äôs not just the innocence and naivety, it‚Äôs the powerless feeling many men feel and isn‚Äôt acknowledged.

Ken comes from a world where men are worthless and their only contribution is as eye candy. He has absolutely no power. Then he gets to the real world, sees patriarchy and doesn‚Äôt understand it nor does he see the harm that comes with it, he just likes the fact that it gives him a feeling of power he never had.

In a similar way, the men who tend to fall into manosphere groups, incel groups, and who get conned by sexual harassers like Andrew Tate and Robert Greene, are men who feel powerless and lost and fall victims to these assholes who manipulate them and get their money while simultaneously making their social skills even worse.

Ken is not evil. He is misguided. He did something wrong but it makes sense why Barbie forgave him and gave him advice and compassion at the end. He wasn‚Äôt being purposely malicious eventhough he did something harmful.",2023-07-22
"Oh yeah he's not a misogynist but he was lost and lacking identity, which is how a lot of guys end up in the wrong groups.",2023-07-23
"Well said. I think they handled the Ken issue really gently and with care, I was pleasantly surprised to see some messaging in there about guys as well.",2023-07-23
"I didn't think about it that deeply while I was watching it, but I picked up on it a little and definitely have to agree. I very much enjoyed the contrast between them, I don't think the movie works without Ken.",2023-07-22
I wanted Ncuti Gatwa to nerd out by kensplaining Doctor Who to Barbie.,2023-07-23
That would‚Äôve been perfect omg,2023-07-22
Why?,2023-07-22
"Felt like they were Red Herrings for the villain role, before it was revealed that Kens took over Barbieland.",2023-07-21
"I was totally expecting there to be some reveal they they were actually toys as well. They were operating on the same sort of dream toy logic as the barbies and kens in barbieland. I wonder if that was there earlier and got cut out, because they had barely anything to do after they arrived in barbieland",2023-07-21
"There is some suggestion they were all toys. They all talked and acted like the Barbies and Kens, and the workers cubicles didn't have doors, just 4 walls; a box.",2023-07-21
"Will Ferrell was the best of them, honestly he was the only one that was needed.",2023-07-21
"Therye kindof the bridge between reality and the toys they produce so it makes sense in a way. Like the second Ken mentions something it just appears in their warehouse, they are at the nexus of their brands meeting the real world, and the people there are essentially the corporate version of barbie, standins for popular conception on how a CEO should be rather than how they are.",2023-07-21
Yeah the Mattel execs felt like an afterhought.,2023-07-21
"Someone I was with mentioned that it seemed like there was a plot line that all the matel execs were actually 'escaped' Kens themselves. The movie mentioned that there were escaped Alans (the whole nsync group), and the execs said they don't care about escaped kens either.",2023-07-21
"I agree, they weren't really necessary for the whole narrative of the film. They didn't even need to come to Barbie Land at the end",2023-07-21
"They didn‚Äôt actually impact the plot in any way, when you think about it. Didn‚Äôt put Barbie back, didn‚Äôt reset the world in any way‚Ä¶ they just kinda followed Barbie around. She was the one making stuff happen.",2023-07-21
"It feels like they added them to tie into the ""mattel cinematic universe""",2023-07-21
I loved them. A fantastic red herring that I absolutely fell for and Will turning out to not be evil and just cares about little girls in the least creepy way possible! I still am laughing from that line üòÑ,2023-07-21
Definitely the weakest link of the movie.,2023-07-21
"Somehow they needed a car chase with the product placement cars.

I was hoping they got found in their hiding spot purely for how blue it is.",2023-07-21
"If I had one nit pick with the movie, it felt like the reasons why Barbie needed to go from Barbieland were rushed in explaining as if they didn't want us to think about it much (which to be fair, was probably the joke). If you're a fan of Pixar Movies that spend a lot of time with world building and explaining the rules of the cross universe relationship (such as Monsters Inc, Soul, and Coco), you may be a bit frustrated.

And to your point, the role of the executives didn't really add much to the film besides serving as a group of people to chase Barbie around.

Mainly, the plot points that moved Barbie & Ken to the real world and then everyone back to Barbieland/Kendom didn't make a ton of sense.",2023-07-26
"Yeah, that plot point went nowhere, no arc and no resolution. They also made the real world appear too goofy, which made the serious issues adressed by the movie appear less serious.",2023-07-21
"Maybe. But Will Ferrell was hilarious, so I didn't mind.",2023-07-21
I hated everyone of their scenes. Didn‚Äôt work for me at all.,2023-07-22
"I legit thought that the movie would end with Barbie turning down Ken to be with the dorky cubicle worker that tagged along with the evil suits 

They really were a red herring overall 

You go in thinking they were gonna be the big bad and it turns out to be Ken",2023-07-21
"Agree 100% - the only thing bad about the film was the inclusion of the Mattel execs. Those characters needed to be more serious and threatening. The second we were introduced to them it felt like we were back in Barbieland, which is problematic. Instead the execs added pretty much nothing to the plot that couldn‚Äôt be dealt with in other ways.",2023-07-21
not enough Jamie Demetriou,2023-07-21
"I thought it was commenting on the cartoonish evil of corporate capitalism in a way. Not saying if I thought it was well done or not, but that was my take at least.",2023-07-22
Them being goofy and kind of unrealistic sort of makes sense since they‚Äôre the main connection between Barbieland and the real world. They have some of the ridiculousness of Barbieland while still being ‚Äúreal.‚Äù,2023-07-22
"I thought Will Ferrel was going to turn out to be a Ken or Allen who had crossed over, and accidentally ended up running Mattel.",2023-07-24
I took it as more of a commentary on corporate America and how all these male suits in high-powered roles are actually idiots half the time,2023-07-24
"Shocked by the comments here. The ensemble of suit guys was one of my favorite parts of the movie! The speaking in unison, the complete failure to capture Barbie, the one guy getting shot out of nowhere, it was all just such campy fun. 

I‚Äôm really happy they didn‚Äôt make them the big villains of the film cause it‚Äôs just too obvious and simple. Ken being twisted is far more interesting and unexpected.",2023-07-25
Yeah my biggest gripe of this movie. I feel like the movie could be better if most of their scenes were cut.,2023-07-21
"When Will Ferrell said ""Call me mother"" I started wondering whether the point was that they were all secretly queer.",2023-07-21
"If I didn‚Äôt know this was a movie by Greta Gerwig, I would have walked out hating the entire real world sequence except Gosling‚Äôs segment. It‚Äôs very poorly written. America Ferrera and her daughter‚Äôs characters were written with the nuance and depth of recent Marvel films. It sucks even more because  Greta has already done a great mother daughter film (probably the greatest ever). Loved the beginning and the end, but the middle is non existent to me.",2023-07-21
As soon as will Ferrell showed he had knowledge that he knew how to get to Barbie land I was betting on him being an older Ken that escaped,2023-07-22
Yeah... it's almost as if this was a satire!,2023-07-21
Except that scene with them on the rollerblades had me fucking rolling,2023-07-31
"It's not an actual real world, there's California instead of USA. That was perfectly deliberate I feel. Putting a doll in a ""perfectly"" realistic world would limit creative options of the film, so they set the expectations clearly at the beginning, but maybe it still got over some people's heads. E.g. our first interaction with Mattel is learning that they are aware of Barbie world.",2023-08-15
"I'm not into musicals or dance numbers, but I will never say no to experiencing that magic again. 

""~Anywhere else I'd be a ten~"" is forever rent free in my head.",2023-07-21
">Margot is SUBLIME

I see what you did there",2023-07-21
I was getting Euphoria S2 finale dance/musical vibes with that energy it was so fucking amazing,2023-07-21
"""I'm a liberated male and it's strong to cry"" or whatever that line is was great.  

They had an opportunity to leave Ken crying as simply a punchline but there's a lot of truth behind that sentiment and I appreciated them leaving that in there.",2023-07-21
"Yeah me too, I need that hoodie.",2023-07-21
"I was hoping to purchase a >!thoughts of impending death!< barbie but alas, tis not available.",2023-07-21
"The 2001 Space Odyssey spoof in the beginning (and was released as part of the marketing) was spot-on, because I felt like this movie was on a Space Odyssey level of surrealism and heady existential ideas.",2023-07-21
"After reading [this article](https://time.com/6289864/barbie-time-cover-story/) I suspect the Mattel executives don't totally understand what they green lit.

>But anytime I get too deep into references or the politics of this film with Gerwig or the actors, I‚Äôm quickly reminded by an executive or a producer that it‚Äôs a fun summer romp.",2023-07-22
"> I'm shocked that Mattel & Warner Bros. greenlit this film

I mean as great as the movie is, it's likely just a 2hr commercial to Mattel. So they'll probably allow some digs and crassness if it means the movie is good enough to drive interest in Barbie",2023-07-21
Idk. Mattel although a corporation has kind if always pushed for little girls to see themselves as more! Barbie has been everything for decades!,2023-07-21
"I was pretty surprised at the ‚Äúbeat each other off‚Äù joke at the very start, lol.",2023-07-23
"yeah I'm gonna email Mattel CS tomorrow about it, they HAVE to produce that shit. It's like printing money for them! Probably didn't even realize so many Kens in the world would want Barbie merch.",2023-07-21
Greta being attached as director already gave me a sign as to how this movie would play out but once Margot and Gosling were attached there was a 0% chance this movie would be style over substance. I‚Äôm glad Mattel and WB let this movie go as far into territories most blockbusters wouldn‚Äôt dare enter.,2023-07-24
"And that the mattel executives were portrayed as idiots that get hurt all the time and just wanna tickle each other. I mean it‚Äôs 100% true, but that greta got away with that was amazing",2023-07-22
"If they don‚Äôt start selling them, they are fools. Barbie and Ken and even Allen costumes will already dominate Halloween this year, I‚Äôm sure.",2023-07-23
It‚Äôs probably much easier to greenlight this movie when you know everyone will be buying hoodies and other merch. They are still ruthless capitalists after all,2023-08-08
I‚Äôm kinda hoping Mattel does tries to copy this film for their other adaptations. I‚Äôll be laughing my ass off at a Viewmaster film that tries to be deep.,2023-07-21
"Not sure how the humour would be seen overseas - I‚Äôm from Australia where SNL is seen as both representative of USA humour but also seen as one of the lamest forms of comedy tbh

I was in a packed theatre for Barbie - some of the jokes were a hoot and really well done (and very smart; eg depression barbie, narrator speaking over Barbie‚Äôs insecurities, Barbie acting stiff like a doll; a lot of other jokes felt flat and to a quiet audience here. Interesting to see if the praise for the comedy is a US only phenomenon.

Really digged the movie references, outfits of Barbies and Kens, the female empowerment monologue was done really well",2023-07-21
"it‚Äôs gonna make money, just like the film says :)",2023-07-22
"yeah i know the lego movie also does it well but having a movie based on a product like barbie having such a message is surprising but great, shame wb only sees a movie based on a product doing well and deciding that's what people like about it",2023-07-29
"I didn't know I needed Ryan Gosling to sing ""Push"" but I totally did! His comedic timing at several points in the movie is impeccable.",2023-07-22
"The best joke of the whole movie was hearing different sections of the theater catch on to the song Ken was playing at Barbie many seconds apart when I started laughing at the first 3 chords. I almost died with how long it took some people, it was hysterical.",2023-07-22
"Well, not literally. The opposite actually.",2023-08-22
BTW Ruth Handler constantly stressing her tax evasion charges was hilarious,2023-07-21
"The line ""mother's stand still, so daughters can look back to see how far they've come"" hit me hard.",2023-07-21
I teared up when she told the old lady she was beautiful which for me made her line land even better.,2023-07-21
"I couldn‚Äôt stop the tears rolling down. I went there expecting a fun and amazing visual experience and I got that but also opened up this memory chest with a new perspective. I saw myself growing up and putting away my Barbies, being to cool for her, and my mom having to feel that in silence. I saw my self when I felt small in a room but had to control my words and thoughts cause they wouldn‚Äôt take me seriously. I felt everything when Ruth told Barbie to stop and breathe.

I loved every detail in this movie. The art direction was inspiring but I never thought I would feel so much and at the same time didn‚Äôt feel alone. A beautiful shared experience.",2023-07-21
"I watched the movie with my mom and I cried like 6 times or more and was still crying leaving the theater. The flashbacks between Sasha and her mom just hit so hard üò≠ Seeing Sasha go from wearing all black to incorporating pink back into her style just meant so much to me, because I went through the same thing. Rejecting everything feminine because you are being constantly told to not be like other girls as a child and that Barbie is the literal devil in disguise for having unrealistic proportions. But it was never Barbie that contributed to my body image issues.",2023-07-21
Biblical even‚Ä¶she was talking to her Creator,2023-07-21
"I spent way too much of this movie all choked up. The opening scene had me misty, America‚Äôs monologue on how hard it is for women, the scene with Barbie and Ruth. I loved the whole movie so much.",2023-07-21
"I cried a few times lol.  The scene where you realize it‚Äôs actually the mom who‚Äôs connected to Barbie and not the daughter.  Oof.  I got into dolls as an adult in that same kind of sad/wistful way, like a lost childhood.  And I have a tween daughter who‚Äôs EXACTLY like the girl in the movie.  Which is both exciting to see an independent personality coming out, but also SO sad to lose my snuggly little girl.  This movie was great.",2023-07-21
Showing the grainy moments of life‚Äôs memories got me. Wasn‚Äôt prepared for that.,2023-07-21
I was going to ask the same question! All the women in my row (including me) cried. I‚Äôm also pregnant with a girl right now so Ruth‚Äôs line about her daughter right before that sequence made me lose it,2023-07-22
"I cried almost the entire time following the scene with Barbie in the LA park. Something about her looking at the trees and all the people around her just being human really got me. And I was bawling by the end when she and Rhea Perlman were in the white space. 

It was a really strange theater experience for me because it was half-empty and no one else was laughing/crying/reacting to anything. Very awkward.",2023-07-22
"honestly i was tearing up at the opening - so much anticipation, in a theater surrounded by people in pink so excited to be there, it just got to me",2023-07-21
"Yes‚ÄîI got emotional a few times throughout the movie,  even during the opening sequence! The scene where Barbie is having a moment sitting on a bench in the real world also got me",2023-07-21
We just got back (my wife and I) and when the real life footage rolled I lost it. Made me think of my wife and my daughter and it fucking got me good.,2023-07-21
I did start to tear up during the end. The movie was really relatable and I‚Äôve felt a lot of the feelings Barbie has.,2023-07-21
I cried a few times! There were some touching moments that got to me.,2023-07-21
I cried throughout this movie! I loved it! I had therapy earlier in the day and was talking about how much my identity has changed since motherhood. When America said something to the effect of moms never getting to do anything fun anymore it felt like they were just quoting my therapy session.,2023-07-21
That ending was definitely emotional. This movie kept surprising me to the very end in the best ways possible!,2023-07-21
I cried during the the flash montage of ‚Äúreal women‚Äù,2023-07-23
I went with my girlfriend and we left an hour ago and she's still crying. It really kicked up a lot of feelings for her,2023-07-21
"I cried a lot. Granted, I‚Äôm going through a big self esteem/what am I doing phase so it poked a lot of buttons for me",2023-07-24
I‚Äôm glad my husband was sitting between me and my very Sasha-like preteen daughter because I didnt want her to see me crying Mom Tears over the last third of the movie. Like all the things I try to pass on to my kid while tempering her for heartbreak and feeling like nothing is right were summed up in the mom‚Äôs speech and Rhea Perlman‚Äôs speech and I was just CRYING üò≠,2023-07-24
"Late response, but I just saw this last night. Before the film, my gf went to the bathroom and there was a woman in there sobbing. She turned to my gf and said that the Barbie movie fucked her up lmao.",2023-08-06
Cried laughing,2023-07-21
"I know I‚Äôm late to the party but I cried multiple times during this movie. Like at least three, but I might‚Äôve lost count. America Ferrara‚Äôs speech and Barbie‚Äôs second talk with Ruth Handler just really got to me",2023-07-29
cried like five times,2023-07-24
"Definitely got a tear, been feeling discard and not so beautiful, smart, whatever so the bit about depression really hit for me. Would've been crying if I wasn't laughing lol",2023-07-24
Ken being introduced to manhood by seeing a giant poster of bill Clinton is another fantastic bit,2023-07-21
"When Barbie starts describing anxiety and a woman just walks up behind her and says that's exactly what it is, I felt that",2023-07-21
I agree. It made me cry too. Especially when she said the old lady was beautiful. The music used for the emotional scenes worked really well.,2023-07-21
"""Look! It's the supreme court!""",2023-07-23
‚ÄúFeels violent to me‚Äù,2023-07-21
"I had this exact experience. Ken goes in head first with what can benefit him, give him power, take advantage of all the things he sees he loves and wants like horses lol... And Barbie just slows down and observes. It was a beautiful contrast.",2023-07-23
"As a man I identified much more with Barbie in that pair of scenes.

I guess I mention that just to point out the #notallmen, #notallwomen aspect to all this - there's almost certainly some kind of ""average"" male experience and some kind of ""average"" female experience which are fairly distinct from one another, but in no way is it actually anywhere near that binary at an individual level.",2023-07-22
That's exactly because they are different,2023-07-21
"This makes me think of a quote I've seen around ""Grown men come to conclusions/realisations women had as 14 year old girls"". Like guys (in a general sense) live in this cushioned ""you're amazing/boys will be boys"" existence for so long (for most of modern history) while for women generally speaking it's one hardship after another particularly in that delicate tween/teen stage. You are taught girls can do anything as a kid then gradually find out how untrue that is.

(Again for anyone angrily typing a rebuttal, I am generalising based on common experiences, not each individual one)",2023-07-23
"It was so powerful for me. Men truly are disconnected from the every micro (and macro) dangers we face. Been through it myself several times when beggars or violent people tried to stop and harass me on the street and I tried to get away from them and my exes always stopped to talk to them. It might've been coming from a good place, but they always put me in danger this way. And no matter how many times it happened, dude is going to stop by those creeps/weirdos while his woman is trying to run away.",2023-07-21
The images men see and fall in love with quickly become a prison. I think the movie was trying to get you to see that this was true for both sexes and I think you missed it,2023-09-11
To me I think it was a perfect illustration of how poorly women understand the male psyche actually.,2023-07-23
[removed],2023-07-25
I‚Äôm a bloke who cried in that bit. It‚Äôs not just women.,2023-08-01
I‚Äôm a man too and I cried at this scene. The juxtaposition was beautiful and neither stereotype wholly represents one gender or the other IMO,2023-07-31
"Uhhh, you got the wrong takeaway from this movie if you think that men only care about power and women only care about feelings.

edit: why the d-votes?",2023-07-21
Stop dating men that you disconnect with? stg its such a specific person who wont learn their lesson who has this kind of relationship problem-- you choose who to date you know that right? You get to pick. Use stricter criteria.,2023-07-21
It was the same coat sylvester stallone  wore in a picture from when ken realized men rule the real world,2023-07-21
Perhaps but I thought it was more from him seeing those pictures of Sylvester Stallone wearing a fur coat during his revelatory moment.,2023-07-21
"It looks nice on Ken. 

This does make me wonder if Ken and the other Kens have watched Fight Club. ü§≠",2023-07-21
I already have this coat from a previous Halloween costume and you bet your fuckin ass I‚Äôm starting crunches now and being incel Ken for Halloween this year.,2023-07-22
That look is going to be popular for Halloween,2023-07-21
Absolutely.,2023-07-21
It reminded me of Joe Namath,2023-07-21
It‚Äôs never a fight club callback.,2023-07-21
I thought it may be Logan Paul reference too lol.,2023-07-23
I thought that the teaser with the monolith was made just for the teaser. When the movie opened with that I was in tears,2023-07-23
And they also reference the end of 2001 while the Billie Eilish song plays with the zoom in on her eye and the montage followed by her in an all white room,2023-07-23
"The vast majority of children who have no idea what 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably won‚Äôt love that part. They‚Äôll be confused, if anything.",2023-07-21
I thought it was a metaphor about how our society pits women against each other so they‚Äôre too distracted to change their status,2023-12-05
"That's the bottom line. Barbie won because this is a movie. And (most) movies have to have a happy ending.

In the real world there is no ending. You win some, you lose some and life just goes on.",2023-12-05
"I liked that they took back their world instead of fixing it, i dont know if it was intentional or not but it kind of gave the message that even if women ruled, it would not be fair to men and they would make the exact mistakes men do in the real world.",2023-12-20
This is absolutely 100 correct and I feel it's the main message I took from the movie,2023-12-17
"I think that was sort of the point, they were definitely commenting on this trend in modern society.",2023-12-17
"It was fun but also thought-provoking. Why did Ken stage a revolt? Because he lived in a female-dominated world and he felt ignored and emasculated. He was not recognized as a person. Which is how many women feel in a male dominated society.

Why did Barbie go to talk with Ruth Handler? Because when you are going through a crisis and wondering who you are and what your purpose in life it, many people want to talk to their Creator.",2023-12-05
It‚Äôs a message for the world tbh. There isn‚Äôt a superior gender. We are all humans with flaws and desires and dreams. We need to embrace one another and accept each other for our difference,2023-07-23
"I feel motivated to comment 'Why are you watching this, you are Kenough on an Andrew Tate video'.

Except I also don't want to give that monster site traffic.",2023-08-08
"I felt bad for Ken. He was made for Barbie and the movie is her telling him ""fuck you""",2023-07-23
So simple yet so beautiful. It‚Äôs the scene I can‚Äôt stop thinking about,2023-07-23
I read they almost cut that scene and Greta fought hard to keep it in,2023-07-23

I really liked that they didn't go with the single mom stereotype,2023-07-21
"I was pleasantly surprised that nothing dramatic caused the rift between America and her daughter. No death, no divorce.

  


Just the natural cause and effect of a girl growing up and trying to prove she's not a kid anymore, even if that breaks a mother's heart.",2023-07-21
"Honestly that's what I thought, too. There's a weird wistfulness when they talked about him in parts, and AF's character said she was feeling ""lonely"" and thinking about death.

It would've made sense, but then I guess they would've had to resolve that subplot as well.",2023-07-21
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they even filmed some scenes in a way where they could make that choice later in editing/based on test screenings.,2023-07-21

"Personally, I have mixed feelings about some of the commentary in the film, but the one thing I thought was really interesting either way, that almost no one has pointed out, is that:

At the end of the film, Ruth Handler informs Barbie that things like ""patriarchy"" (and an equivalent word for Ken, I forget what it was) are just ideas that human beings invent for themselves, so they can cope with their suffering on Earth before they die. It was almost like she was telling Barbie that patriarchy isn't ""real"" in the sense she thinks it is, and that what was more important now was Barbie's journey to discovering her own identity.

It was wild and I didn't expect that to be in there, and I think that most people won't notice it till later on either.",2023-07-21
"The people complaining they ""pulled the punches"" on Ken feels like they missed the entire point of the monologue given by America Ferrara. 

He, like Barbie, is just a doll. It's unfair to put the entire patriarchy on him when the only reason he engaged in it was he felt lost afraid and unseen. 

Was it wrong of him yes. Can you understand how he stumbled into it? Also yes.",2023-07-21
"This is really well put - I‚Äôve already had multiple people online respond to my effusive praise for this movie with the usual word salad about it villainizing men/Ken, but I quite love this interpretation of it.

I think your Kenalysis is spot on,2023-07-22
"> One observation I havent seen made much is regards to Ken. A few critics have accused the film of ""Pulling its Punches"" with regards to Ken in the end.
> 
> How I saw it was that Ken wasn't a representation of Tate/Petersen/RedPill leaders, so much as a representation of the naive 12 year old boys who don't know enough about the world to not fall for it

I don't see Ken's transformation to be something akin to alt-right extremism where impressionable youths are taken in by the appealing surface-level appearance of conservative ideology. 

I saw Ken as an analog for females growing up in a male-dominated world. When Ken went on his walk, he saw men in positions of power that he couldn't imagine himself as in Barbieland. Feminism in our world is that push from females to create a system where they can achieve those positions of power when they normally couldn't.  Just as feminism is the vehicle for females to obtain systemic power, Ken saw the same thing in the patriarchy. He saw the system that would allow him to obtain those positions in power just as a female looks to feminism to rightfully empower them.

My only problem with the ending is that Ken didn't reject this ideology by his own volition. He only left that way of thinking once the system he created was destroyed.",2023-07-21
"Absolutely agree on the incel comparison. It felt like Gerwig was trying to drive home a message that Ken wasn't the villain, but rather that patriarchy is the villain. Incels are created by men defining themselves in their relation to women, just like Ken does. The ""Ken is me"" scene is making a point that men need to find an identity that doesn't need to center around women, whether that be obsessing over them or oppressing them. Our modern world has a crisis of identity when it comes to masculinity. Most of us have recognized that what masculinity *used to* be is unacceptable, but we've failed to fully realize an alternative, positive form of masculinity for men to follow. There are elements out there, but I don't think they've come into sharp focus yet. The redpill movement and others like it are a rejection of the mainstream critique of an older, toxic masculinity in the face of not knowing where else to go with their identity. I believe that the Ken plotline of this movie is a rebuke of the redpill movement and an attempt to reveal its shortsightedness and direct men towards the revelation that we need to create a new identity that doesn't depend on women to define ourselves.

Most of my thoughts I just laid out actually come from a Contrapoints video I watched a few years back that stuck with me. I'll need to see if I can track it down, but it feels like it could have been written as a direct analysis of this movie. She talked all about the concept of a missing positive masculine identity and how men using women to define themselves creates the toxic behaviors that have defined the patriarchy both for men and women. 

It speaks so wonderfully to this movie that I think it has just as much to say to men as it does to women. The lessons are very different, but both are sympathetic to their respective audiences. There is no villain here besides the system itself that traps all of us.",2023-07-24

"Honestly I feel like the movie was long enough but could have gone without the mom and daughter entirely, keep the focus on Barbie and have her be the one to deliver the monologue so that it feels more earned, the fact that the movie switched main characters halfway through really took a lot of momentum out of the plot. I feel like the Lego movie did the whole child and parent relationship aspect a lot better anyways, if the Barbie movie had taken a little less out of the script about how hard it is to be a woman and had instead made the central conflict more about Barbie wanting to be a human and what it means to feel and grow old and die then the ending scene would have also held a lot more weight, to me it felt unearned as well.",2023-07-25
"Very nice write-up, interesting point about the 'unearned' for a lack of a better word monologue. I found myself a bit confused and uneasy by what Barbie as a film was trying to do and your comment helped to highlight some things that perhaps contributed to me receiving the film that way.

There's one point I strongly disagree with:
 
> Ryan Gosling has never been more funny and charismatic in a movie, ever. 

He was funnier in The Nice Guys and exhibited a similar type of charisma there as well.

PS. Regarding the board of execs being underdeveloped, I thought it was an interesting contrast to the dolls who seemed to possess distinct personalities (this is also visually represented by them all having different outfits, professions and affinities), but the suits were all interchangeable (except Will Ferrell) and the nature of their jobs seemed to restrict them from going outside the corporate hive-mind standard.",2023-07-25

It's obvious Ken still wants Barbie even when he has all the patriarchy behind him. That's not the power he wanted. I think people are choosing to miss the point. It's very easy to make this movie into whatever you want for one's own political agenda. But it really can just be an enjoyable film.

Just watched it last night, and this is how I felt. Overall still thought they brilliantly wove satire and fantasy, which is more than anyone could've expected from a movie about a toy. But the monologue brought the narrative to a screeching halt. I already felt like America Ferrara's acting was the weakest part of the movie (at some points her delivery sounded like she was just reading the script). But then they gave her that long-winded on-the-nose monologue and it took me out completely.

Still enjoyed it, though, and I think Margot Robbie deserves all the awards. It's one thing for actors to ham it up in Oscar-bait movies, but Margot making me believe she really was a toy having an existential crisis in a comedy was just masterful.",2023-12-23

We also see a Skipper in this Barbie world, but we also know that Stereotypical Barbie is the first one in this Barbie world to experience something like this and is the first one there to go to the real world, so if that's the case, that had to have been a different Skipper, presumably from a parallel Barbie world different than the one we see.",2023-07-22

How is it surprising that the take is that all men are bad?",2023-07-21
"Because the movie concluded by having the Barbies turn the kens back into a slave class and say they wouldn't stop till the exaggerated patriarchy thing of the outside world was stopped. 

It was a surprisingly anti male movie. I assumed it was gonna be a fun comedy action about a princess in the modern world, like encanto. It was not. 

The message of the film was clearly that men are wildly sexist, and they need to be kept enslaved as accessories or they will oppress women. Which is a strange message. It shows the film has been in development for a while. This is more 2017 feminism than more modern feminism. They didn't really give ken any sort of fulfilment or development on his life, he was just enslaved again.",2023-07-21

Does that mean that men right now deserve to be bullied and demoralised into oblivion? That men deserve to be called loser and humiliated by women, except if they are the top 20% of men physically, in that case they are allowed to be the career women's poolboys that women get to use like a toy literally like in the movie. This is what women want to do with men. You are everything like the patriarchal selfish men you supposedly hate. Everything! Don't you realise that I'm literally suicidal over this? that because of tinder and female hypergamy there is literally no future for me? that I have literally never got love from a woman except my own mother?

They tried to make the Kens represent women and the patriarchy and it kind of ruins the point of both. Also the whole thing about Kens needing to discover themselves is really a feminist idea come to life that after patriarchy is ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù men will be able to cry and find themselves etc - It‚Äôs something which fell flat in the movie because really only feminists pretend men actually care about this. It‚Äôs a feminist idea of how ‚Äúpatriachy hurts men too‚Äù and why they‚Äôre also helping men with feminism (regardless of what men think about it) so that was why that was there. It would be confusing to most men that that was supposed to be a happy ending for the Kens but that‚Äôs how a feminist would view it.,2023-07-24

"I felt like the mother daughter relationship was pretty rushed, and everything just happens really fast and conveniently. I really liked the way the director intended to convey her politics though. Also, I didn't get Micheal Cera's character. Allan's just 'there' at the end, he's not being acknowledged even then. I think it's a good film to make men, who are willing to understand things from women's perspective, understand how being un/under-represented feel. Why does Barbara visit the gynaec at the end? I get that it's a personal choice, but is having a uterus what defines a woman? What about transwomen, then? Is that affirmation required?

Basically,

1. Mother-daughter relationship didn't work for me, felt artificial, and I think they could've used a more capable actress.
2. Allan's arc.
3. The ending (I'm just confused about the ending)

"I think with the Anti-Men stuff it feels like it almost hits the mark of making a salient point but misses and then goes nowhere, same with most of the messages in the film. For instance Ken lives a life of existing just to get Barbie's attention, he's finally shown some respect in the real world and immediately goes 100% the other way. When he tries to find a job and gets rejected I thought that was making a point that Men aren't just handed things by virtue of being Men, but then it was undermined by him being able to turn Barbieland into a patriarchy and learning nothing from the rejection. Then again I thought they were going to make an interesting point with the Barbie preferring Kenworld because it's like a spa day for her brain, then immediately undermined that with them all just being brainwashed, and Ken being stressed from being a ruler was just a side joke. 

There was also a weird point where the Barbie's purposely manipulated the Kens into violence, which almost seems like it's suggesting women are secretly behind war and conflict between men and then it just turned into it all just being a distraction for the dumb Kens so they could keep Barbieland the same. Then the unified Ken's instead of convincing the Barbies to be more equal just fell apart with Ken crying. 

That also brings me to another point, Men's mental health is not treated very well in this film, Barbie has a really powerful scene of crying and feeling true emotion but then Ken's showing emotion is played for laughs and mocked as fragility.

I found the movie had a lot of mixed messages, not just with gender but with things like capitalism too where it takes an anti-capitalist stance whilst still being one big glorified advert for Barbie, like it mocks it but leans into it at the same time. 

The film then sort of goes on to talk about how women are hypercriticised and there's no correct way to do feminism, it just means having the opportunity to do what you want to do, but then kind of criticises men and paints the correct way for them to be. It even paints a picture of the ""correct"" form of masculinity being a placid goofball butt of the joke (unless having to fight toxic masculinity) and is just bullied for trying to learn another language or wanting to be happy. 

There was quite a mean spirited undertone to the film, and it felt like it contradicted itself a lot when it makes men the butt of the joke for just living their life like Alan and the Duo-lingo husband did but then turns them into villains for having autonomy.

Sure maybe the purpose is to turn the tables, show men how it feels to be constantly scrutinised, but then is that sort of nuance suitable for a movie about a child's toy? Like surely people will just come away from the film with an eye for an eye type attitude instead of realising two wrongs don't make a right. I think the duolingo dad in particular left a bitter taste in my mouth, like he did nothing wrong and got bullied/mocked for no reason.",2023-07-29
"At the end Barbie basically womansplains to Ken how to find himself and educated him while he cries about how much he loves her. And that‚Äôs a happy ending? Reverse the sexes and it‚Äôs highly offensive and no women would call it a happy ending.

The anti men part comes from making every man in the movie an idiot. Even little moments like where Gloria and her kid see her husband - he is a doofus who his wife and daughter role their eyes at. I think Gerwig revealed she has a bit more contempt for men than she cares to admit here.

And in spite of Barbie land supposedly being a reverso of the real world for gender - it‚Äôs not a 1 for 1. In the real world women are portrayed sympathetically and as intelligent. The Kens are portrayed as morons who don‚Äôt even want to be in charge they‚Äôre just insecure. So the oppressed Kens standing up to the Barbies are supposedly the equivalent of real world women, yet are all incompetent morons who you‚Äôre supposed to root against as the Barbies take back over. And on top of that, they were idiots anyway so it‚Äôs clearly showing they didn‚Äôt even deserve any high position. 

The movie is anti men, and merely saying it‚Äôs satire can‚Äôt excuse that.",2023-07-29
">Barbieland is a matriarchy, but the Kens are not objectified, nor pushed into servitude ‚Äî they just coexist with the Barbies but are still accessories to the Barbies with no real agency or identity of their own. When Barbie comes back and teams up with the other Barbies to correct the patriarchy, she implores Ken to find meaning as Ken, not just as an accessory to Barbie. She acknowledges the matriarchy wasn‚Äôt fair either. She wants him to live out his own purpose, to have agency ‚Äî even after everything he did. Ken isn‚Äôt evil, and the Barbies aren‚Äôt man-haters but the Kens fell victim to patriarchy too as men.

"This.

If the film was anti-men it wouldn't have highlighted Ken's dissatisfaction at being just a side-piece in Barbie's world.

The ending for the Kens  I think has levels of irony too nuanced for some viewers. And i don't mean to be a snob about it, I've just taught english for a few years and have come to realize at least a third of people don't understand anything that isn't explicitly said for them in their art. The ending vouches for the Kens having a slow (argualbly superficial) path to equality rather than instant justice. Which some audience members don't get. Because the Ken portion of the film doesn't have a happy ending in a movie where most everything else is dressed up as traditional comedy.

I get a person seeing that ending and thinking the film is agreeing with what happens to the Kens, but it's not.  Rather, it's saying 'this is how life actually works a lot of the time; sucks don't it?'",2023-07-26

So of course they don‚Äôt get the points of movies like this because asking them to think critically of themselves; or even slightly inconvenience themselves for the sake of positive change, is too much work for them.

"My daughter and her friends are GenZ, in college, and their take on the ending is that it's a message about fighting the system.  The Kens tried to change the Constitution but were too busy fighting each other.  And we need to change the Constitution so that women have equal rights under the law.

Women currently don't have equal rights, which is why it's perfectly legal to prevent women from having abortions, even when they are medically necessary.

Women currently don't have equal rights, which is why gynecologists are under attack by the US gov't, especially in certain states.

Dr. Caitlin Bernard was punished by a gov't appointed agency for speaking to the press about the effects of new abortion laws, particularly on victims of child rape.  If the gov't and patriarchy bully our doctors into silence, how can voters know the effects of their new laws and vote in their best interests?

What's stopping us from having the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment) that would grant women equal rights?  Maybe we are distracted like the Kens are.  Rich men are trying to distract us by saying we should be afraid of Mexicans crossing the border or afraid of Sharia law or afraid of Democrats grooming their children.

"I think Barbie liked being able to have complex emotions and once she experienced the real world and realized women arent powerful just because of playing with Barbie, she couldnt go back to Barbieworld and just pretend everything is fine. She malfunctioned and couldnt undo everything she learned about women",2023-07-27
"Barbie realized that she basically had no sense of self. She was literally ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Aside from being an icon of beauty, she was a completely flat person. Simply an idea of the ideal woman physically. Beyond that, she literally had nothing. And having been changed by the real world, she couldn't go back to simply being ""Stereotypical Barbie"".

By choosing to become a human, she gave herself the ability to grow into her own person. She was no longer simply the idea of ""stereotypical Barbie"", she was now her own person. She even adjusted her name to Barbara to show this change.",2023-07-27

"Thats the point.  Its highlighted at the end when she says it's Barbie **AND** Ken.  That's one of lessons Barbie learns in the end; that a lot of this was her fault and she wasn't being fair.  They then poke fun at reality when the Kens ask for a seat on the supreme court and they say they can have a seat in the lesser court.

Barbieland is an extreme matriarchy where the Kens exist only as an accessory to Barbie.  In the end they make incremental movement toward a fairer world, but its largely superficial.  The feminism point here is a lot of the changes over the last few decades have been superficial and there is still a lot of work to do to have an equal world.",2023-09-01
"Barbieland is a fantasy land and none of the real people ask to stay there at the end. They all go home happily. Most of the Allens (e.g. N'Sync) escaped years ago and the one Barbie who saw the real world decides to become a real person instead of a thing in a fake fantasy land. So no, Barbieland is not actually sold as better than reality in this film. The narrator admits she lets the Barbies think their reality is perfect, that doesn't mean it is perfect. It's a fun place for girls to visit not stay.

A lot of it is silly. Remember they are dolls. The houses have no walls, the construction workers were pushing invisible dirt. They don't drink or eat. There is no real water in Barbieland. All the plants are plastic. Pregnant Midge just stands in the corner outside all day at Skippers tree house. When Ken took over the mountains were carved into horse heads in a single day. Wherever the Kens stay at night they are not physically suffering. 

That the Kens have nothing is both horrible but also a joke based on the reality of the Barbie toy brand. Ken was never the big seller. The best selling Ken ever is that Magic Earring Ken that was only on the market for 6 months. Ken wasn't worth developing a lot of accessories for. I'm almost certain little girls are more likely to have *two* Barbies than a Barbie and Ken. This is no different than my little brother had action figures and almost no girls existed in his role play unless I joined him and created girl transformers or whatever. My brother didn't care at all about girl characters or roll playing their story. Many little girls are the same but it is the boy toys they don't care about.

If little girls did have a Ken, then maybe the little girl pretended Barbie and Ken were married, but maybe they dated. In the little girl's fantasy where did boyfriend Ken live when Barbie went to her dreamhouse at night? Possibly no where. A little girl is not going to beg her parents for a Ken house. Ken can live in the Lincoln logs or in a shoe. Barbie might go on adventures and Ken would be left out. She might playact a date with Ken and then toss him aside so Barbie could go to work, or have a party, or time travel to visit the stuffed dinosaurs. Maybe a little girl had her Barbie kill Ken and bury him in the backyard. There are many things for the little girl to do but Barbie is the feature and Ken is simply an accessory to her story, like the pink car, or the pooping dog. 

The creators of this film were aware of the tragic essence of Ken. Ryan Gosling tells a story when he was first asked to play Ken, that he went outside and saw his own kid's Ken doll face down in the dirt and he then understood Ken's story. It is a sad reality for the poor Ken doll. He might come in different forms but he really is an afterthought of the Barbie Universe. So the Ken arc in the film was an effort to be authentic to the toy and how Ken was used by the girls who played with them. He's a girls' toy with a batshit crazy villain arch that I could absolutely see a little girl creating with a little girl's understanding of patriarchy and feminism. These concepts matter but this is a deliberately silly movie that doesn't take them too seriously. At the end Ruth points out that these are made up concepts by people trying to deal with the confusion and complexity of life.  

There is a good message in the movie for Ken to work on himself and understand his own needs and value. Ken learned to not define himself through a relationship with someone who doesn't meet his needs and the movie does make it clear that Barbie was a bad girlfriend who did not value him. That is a solid character arc for an accessory character. 

So yeah, tl;dr: 1. No Barbieland is not actually presented as better than the real world. 2. Ken's story is true to his toy essence/Barbie Zeitgeist. It isn't about real men or an attack on all men. 3. Yes Kens are ridiculously second class in Barbieland and the creators are aware of that. They even lampshade it at the end with one of the comments by President Barbie.  

Edit: spelling and rearranged the paragraphs to make more sense.",2023-08-31
"The movie explicitly says the Kens will have the same rights as women in the real world so I'm pretty sure this is the takeaway you are supposed to have. Like that's the joke, that things still aren't really fair for the Kens at the end of the movie.

""The only thing that they do to contribute to the Barbies is just stand aside and look nice."" - So yeah, sort of like what women for the last few millennia have been expected to do. The comparison is definitely intentional.

*Edited to clarify a sentence",2023-09-01
That's literally the exact point of the movie dude,2023-09-03
"I'm going to try to explain this with the nuance there is, but I'm not sure if I'm going to do a good job:

None of the Barbies personally treated Kens badly. They were each personally nice to them, let them live their lives, have their personal freedoms. They just didn't center them in their lives and preferred to be around each other. The Kens could have gotten together to have boys nights and support each other the way the Barbies did. They chose not to.

While not being a priority to someone you love does really hurt, and it hurt Ken that he wasn't really on Barbie's priority list, she's not required to center him in her world if she doesn't feel that way and it's still not treating him poorly. You can force someone to want to be with you when they don't want to. In real life, you talk about it and/or walk away.  This is one place where the main Barbie did hurt her Ken personally because she knew how he felt about her yet she continued to hurt him.

Where the Kens were treated poorly on a mass level was this: they had no political power and the Barbies were neglectful of their political and person situations (like not having homes) because they just didn't think about it or care since their lives were centered and great, but it was not done maliciously. 

Kens didn't have houses because these are girls toys and little girls care about the Barbies and not Kens so there are no Ken's dream house. They were never created. All the houses you see in the movie are actual dream homes that were sold. Why would girls toys center men? This is in line with the toys themselves and how girls will play with their owns toys. However, if you want to make a point about Kens not being treated fairly in the movie just for discussion sake, the Barbies neglect of this situation is sad.

When the Barbies realized the Kens weren't equal in the end, they actually cared, apologized, and wanted to prevent things from going back to how things were before. They didn't whine and fight it and scream that they were the real victims, Kens deserved it, or things were already equal. The point about Kens not getting political power was a very on the nose commentary about our real life society.

The Kens treated the Barbies way worse when they stole power. They brainwashed the Barbies, maliciously took away their power, and reduced them to sexualized slaves in skimpy outfits feeding them beer. That is vile. This is what I was referring to when I mentioned the Barbies let Kens have their personal freedoms. They didn't reduce Kens to sexual objects and make them serve them like this. Kens were free to do and wear what they wanted. Barbies didn't require Kens to follow them around and do their bidding and wait on them, they let them live their lives and hung out with them when they wanted to because they were friends. The Kens never apologized for treating the Barbies so horribly in the end.

Now lets contrast that with women in the real world. Men treat women horrifically in the real world. Women are raped, murdered, beaten, trafficked, dehumanized, treated like slaves, etc by men. No, it is not both sides or even close to being equal. Women are kept out of positions of power even though some have broken through on lower levels. Women's rights are being erased and so many men are gleeful about it. When women get angry and try to change things, men in general have fits. They don't want to hear it, they will scream to deny it, and will actively do things to harm women politically and personally just to rub it in more.  Real women aren't treated as well as the Kens or even have the personal freedom Kens had.

Does that help?",2023-09-04

"The guy who's smart enough to see the toxicity in the behaviour of Kens. He's standing there with a judgmental look in his face during that initial Gosling Ken and Simu Ken faceoff. Later when Kens take over with their version of patriarchy, he decides that Kendom is not a place where he wants to be and leaves with Gloria and Sasha. When they decide to return, he goes with them to try and bring the Barbieland back. I don't think he's necessarily gay though he might be. In the Barbielore, Allan is married to Midge and is the father of her baby. Not sure if this is also true in the movie - leaving his pregnant wife behind wouldn't be a good look.",2023-07-22

"> to show that people will never be satisfied and look for reasons to be offended by anything

This was absolutely not the point of the fascist line and tbh that's a really dumb and lazy take. That's one of the most important criticisms of Barbie, that she is a symbol of consumerism, capitalism, and corporate America and she reinforces ultra-orthodox Aryan beauty standards. Politically, these are intertwined with conservativism and white supremacy.

Without these criticisms there would be no reason for this film to be so hyper self-aware and sociopolitically critical at all. This movie literally could not be made without the criticisms of the cultural hegemony that Barbie represents.

So for you to say ""it's just to show people will get upset about anything"" is hilariously off base.",2023-07-28

But is the point that yes, equality takes time or ""doesn't this seem dumb and can't we just get to equality now?"" 

I think it's the latter.  Meaning... The whole point of this bit is that we need more SC judge representation of diversity of gender and I'd add... Some more stuff.",2023-07-31
"Why am I upset at the line? 

In the Real World women don't have equality, and we're -correctly obviously- told over and over this is a bad thing.

So to say ""Ken's will get the same equality as women in the real world"" they're saying Ken's will never get quality. They will be as mistreated as we saw Barbie be when she got to the real world. 

Why not end on equality in Barbieland? They showed us sexist societies the whole movie and missed the chance to show what the alternative looks like. 

Am I supposed to be happy the Kans will always be oppressed? Why? Why would that sit right with anyone?

Barbie was made to be ""every possibility"" but ended up wanting to just be human and choose for herself. She was born special and amazing, but wanted a normal life.

Ken was made to be simply ""an accessory"" and ended up learning that he could be his own person with his own identity. He was born disposable, and just wanted to be special to someone... and in the end, it had to be to himself.

"""Then you have Barbie tell Ken he isn't defined by his girlfriend, he is defined by who he is.""

This doesn't ring true to me as something men actually struggle with and it's not all kumbayya holding hands around the campfire among women - plenty of competition and lack of validation to be found amongst us. Ever opened up social media? The problem is that the movie tries to use Ken as an analog for both the male and female experiences and it only creates confusion.",2023-07-22

"I can point out a bunch stuff that couldve used improvement. Like the mother-daughter characters didnt feel very fleshed out, and the Mattel guys kinda lost significance about 20 minutes after their introduction and film feels stuffed with messages it wants to convey.

But there are the things I absolutely loved like set design, the direction, cinematography, the tender, emotionally rich moments Id expect from a Greta Gerwig film and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performances were perfection.

I wouldnt say it exceeded my expectations but it did meet them.",2023-07-23
"Inventive, great production design, but weirdly the thought that nagged me throughout the movie was how fucking cool it would have been if this came out 10-15 years ago. I feel like it would have been transgressive, irreverent, and so ahead of its time (obviously lol) when Barbie was still I think a little more culturally relevant? 

But in 2023 it seems weirdly outdated, I felt like it was diet feminism in a way. I agree with it being on the nose at least for the target adult audience who are probably already largely feminists. Like I think this movie would be great for pre-teen and early adolescent boys and girls but I counted mostly full grown adults in the audience",2023-07-21
"I felt the same. I liked it, but didn‚Äôt love it. I enjoyed the campiness and how over the top ridiculous it got. All of the actors killed it and the whole aesthetic of the movie was great.

Some random thoughts:

- As mentioned, some of the dialogue was too on the nose. One of my pet peeves is when it feels like characters are explaining everything.

- The Mattel HQ and higher ups felt like they fit more in Barbieland than LA. 

- Didn‚Äôt like how easily Barbie was able to convince the mother/daughter who she was. I would‚Äôve had them skeptical until they actually see Barbieland with their own eyes.

- The daughter went from asshole to accepting everything really quick. Felt like there should‚Äôve been more time in Barbieland where the mother/daughter connect.

- Michael Cera beating up all those construction workers made me laugh. Will Ferrell just being Will Ferrell was funny too.

- the music and dance numbers were great.

I think it‚Äôs a 7/10 for me.",2023-07-22

"Same here. Gf and I walked into the theater with high expectations, walked out confused and more than a little disappointed. 

Everything was great until Ken went back to Barbieland and somehow brainwashed all the Barbies and turned the entire place upside down all by himself. That made no sense and the movie pretty much fell apart for us after that. 

The message was fine and absolutely expected, but the way the second half was set up and resolved with the Barbies being ""deprogrammed"" and manipulating the Kens into fighting themselves felt really forced and left us both with a bad taste in our mouths. It was so on the nose that it ended up not being very fun or satisfying for us at all. Also the Mattel exec and mother/daughter storylines went nowhere.

I guess we're in the minority in this thread but I have a feeling a lot of people our age (gen z) are going to leave the theaters with a similar feeling of disappointment.

Margot and Ryan absolutely killed it though.",2023-07-21
"I think it's gonna hit hard for some people more than others. For me, the journey Barbie goes through emotionally was near identical to how it felt for me to ""become a woman"" and seeing that reflected in the ultimate girlhood symb (Barbie) was a very emotional and beautiful experience for me, full of lots of depth and nuance

that isn't to say that you're wrong, just to say that isn't it incredible the exact same movie can be experienced SO differently? just speaks to the high strangeness of art",2023-07-21
"I am right there with you for the most part. I had higher expectations that the movie would have a more meaningful and and well told message as well, especially since I felt that Ken stole a bit too much of the spotlight from Barbie. I also felt that Ken had a more impactful emotional climax than Barbie and while I thought it was enjoyable I felt it a bit counterproductive for the overall messaging of the movie. 

My biggest issue with the movie is the product placement, and the humor trying to be a bit too purposefully funny or camp. 

In my theater about half the jokes fell flat, and it was primarily jokes that had the ""penguin of doom lol so random"" style of humor that got the least laughs. To me it feels like those jokes were written a few years ago and now that type of humor just isn't as funny. I mean I can dig the impressive sets and goofy antics but it started to feel forced and off pace (during the chase through the Mattel building someone let out a big sigh because it was more boring than funny or interesting). 

In terms of the ads, the Chevy car chase scene was way too distracting and honestly felt really forced (the whole corporate plotline was forced and flimsy imo). At least the Birkenstocks and the Barbie ad were funny, but I felt it was still a little too obvious and distracted from the movie itself.",2023-07-21

"I agree with you. I liked the film, but I think as a feminist film, the message was too on the nose and lacked subtlety. It was a bummer Greta Gerwig chose such a black-and-white approach to the issue with no depth. Maybe it's because it's her first big budget film and she needed to simplified the story for a broad appeal, but considering how good the scripts were for her previous two films, I think she could have done better.

Anyway, it's was refreshing to see a big budget film like this went full bonkers and took a risk in storytelling. That alone makes this film worth watching.",2023-07-21
"I really do not understand why they focused so much on Ken and his feelings 

Like it felt like this was a movie about making sure a mans ego was okay and not about Barbie finding her new place in the world

Like Ryan Gosling had like 5 solo songs and like a 30 minute sequence all just about Ken 

And like initially I got it, haha patriarchy ruined barbieland, great bit

But it just KEPT going, and then Barbie had to console and comfort Ken

Also, Alan did nothing

This movie started so fun and then got super incoherent",2023-07-22
"Crazy how I long I had to scroll to find this, I definitely agree. Everyone wanted Barbie to be a masterpiece, me included. I had very high hoped before the reviews came out. Less so afterwards, but I was a little let down even still. It's not a bad movie by any regard and has plenty of funny jokes and a gorgeous aesthetic, as well as great performances from Robbie and Gosling. But as for the script, it felt really messy at times with satire as sharp as a sledgehammer and clumsy monologues. 

I feel like this proves the assumption wrong that a great filmmaker is enough to make something great out of pure corporate IP. The movie is too closely tied to protecting barbie's brand it never has anything interesting to say about it, at least in depth. All the attempts to go deeper and explore the themes of the movie felt surface-level and like they were approved in some boardroom beforehand. Like the one at matter HQ.",2023-07-21

Also we sort of expected them to get back together but they didn't.  Even Barbie acknowledged and apologised for her treatment of Ken earlier- they were fulfilling heteronormative roles expected of them to the point they weren't themselves.

"I would identify the ‚Äòissue‚Äô with this movie that many people experience as the fact that it tells women ‚Äòyou are inherently valuable and should not need to do anything to be respected‚Äô while telling men ‚Äòyou are inherently flawed, dumb and violent but if you behave yourself well you can be loved‚Äô, which is exactly what will rile up the more incelly parts of the world even more.

It *kind of* turns in around at the end with an idea of ‚Äòbeing human is a fundamentally fucked up thing to try to be‚Äô but the take-away message is so severely undercut by the ‚Äòlets defeat the idiot men with their inherent idiocy‚Äô that it almost disappears.

I had a great time at the movie but any story about gender dynamics that inherents a strong ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô attitude will only ever add fuel to the divide, which is exactly what we‚Äôre seeing now. I wish it had focused more on the idea of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all struggling, life is a series of fucked up paradoxical expectations for everyone, maybe your genitalia don‚Äôt define your worth?‚Äù. It‚Äôs in there, but it is drowned out in (satisfying, but unhelpful) Yas Queen v Douche Bro rhethorics.

I think most people who see this movie, regardless of gender, identify more with Barbie than with Ken. But the movie seems to not know that.",2023-07-23
"Men were obviously not the main point of the movie, but as one of those boyfriends who saw the film with my girlfriend, there were definitely moments that resonated with me and felt spoken to directly about expectations and how I do or don't define myself based on those expectations. You could look at Barbie world where men are one of many things the women are supposed to accomplish on their way to being a girl boss who has it all, but also where men don't gave space to emotionally define themselves, or you can look at the patriarchical real world where you do define yourself by your job but inevitably it is a pyramid scheme where if you're not at the top, you question your own value. And then Kendom in many ways was a cartoonish world defined by stereotypical expectations of what ""being a man"" is, that the Kens (much like the non-Margot Barbies in Barbie World) didn't really consider whether it was what they wanted, but I feel like the viewer was supposed to. The ""moral"" for men, just like for women, isn't that either ""world"" shows the ideal of how things should work. Moreso the ""moral"" is the choice Barbie is given at the end of the film to define meaning for themselves, and then the movie ends open ended. Ken didn't have that same moment, but as a viewer, I felt like the moral was supposed to be the same.

I also might be the type to not feel so uncertain about my place in the world to read personal slights into systemic criticism. Because I could see any number of spots some would get sidetracked in and not see the macro point.",2023-07-23
"It brings up what feminists think men are going through. In reality the whole Ken crying and going off to find himself is more of a thing that feminist women would say to each other that men should like to see and care about, rather than something men actually care about.

She's already won at that point. She sees him suffering and she cares about him, why wouldn't she comfort him? 

She's been ignoring him every day for centuries. Like it didn't even occur to her that he might be homeless. 

They didn't make it about them getting together, which would have been the easy choice. Her journey isn't about him. But even as a friend she never once considered his feelings. 

Of course she was angry at first but to move forward and grow she had to see how things got to where they are. And part of that is realizing that she never thought of him. That's what she's apologizing for. The movie would be weaker without that.",2023-08-06

"Totally agree with a lot of the critique I‚Äôve read here.
1. Will Farrell parts were unnecessary and muddled the message.
2. The Ken war was also superfluous and added nothing to the story.

Biggest gripe:
Would also liked to see more of Gloria and Sashas‚Äôs relationship, as I felt that that was the most moving aspect of the film. How Barbie represented this hopeful, idealized feminine dream for Gloria, and how growing up forces women to contend with the ‚Äúreality‚Äù that we aren‚Äôt as far along in terms of gender equality as we hope to be. I think the film is correct in suggesting Barbie‚Äôs journey is essentially Gloria‚Äôs journey, just thought it would have been handled more realistically. It‚Äôs not enough for Gloria to have a ‚Äúrallying speech‚Äù in the last act. Without showing the viewer why she feels this way, the speech doesn‚Äôt feel earned, and was a classic case to ‚Äútelling without showing‚Äù

All in all thought it was a terrific concept, but could‚Äôve been pared down in terms plot points, which would have made the central message, humor and poignancy shine more. A for effort, but also a bit of a squandered opportunity.",2023-08-19

I thought what was going to happen was she would teach this girl who was playing with her how to not be such a shitty kid and rub her good attitude on her and then this kid would teach her about being a human with her angsty teen feelings, but the daughter straight up didn‚Äôt need to be there.",2023-08-15

"I feel liked you missed the point of the film, the whole point was to reverse the roles to show how almost comical the gender roles we have in 'the real world'. Men having no emotions was a idea created by men and this movie was to poke fun at that as well as other things. I dont know where you are from but in my country we have a terrible women to men ratio in politics for a 'modern' and wealthy country that is. And reading you point on men not going to school in america i'm assuming is honestly funny, like are you taking the piss? Some girls arent aloud to go to school because they were simple born girls, these young men dropping out of school because of some republican view they hold is a joke and its honestly embarrassing you would compare that to girls struggles in education etc. Politics and power is not even for men and women, not even in america.",2023-12-26
"I really agree with your comment! I really enjoyed the first half - I had a big smile on my face! But by the end, I was so confused about what was happening. I definitely think that they tried to focus on too many storylines and should have just focused in on one or two - cut out the CEO (I am so confused about what that added to the story besides shock factor? He didn‚Äôt even end up being the bad guy in the end?) or really cut down the number of Barbies and their screen time. 

One of the reasons I was so excited for Greta to do this film is because I felt like she portrayed such a beautiful, complex picture of womanhood and feminism in Little Women without making it preachy - it felt so genuine and human to me. And true to how those characters would experience the world. So I was disappointed when the feminist messaging in this movie came out to be so one size fits all and woman vs men. It felt like the conclusion of the movie was like ‚Äúall women living under patriarchy are brainwashed and we just need to enlighten them and take over men! then everything will be good again!‚Äù And then to add in the mother-daughter tones of Ruth - it was just a LOT happening and not in a very nuanced way or felt true the the characters",2023-07-21

I worry about this message being the message a lot in modern feminism in both social media and traditional media, and I say this as a woman. I'm in a very happy marriage and expecting my first child (a son), and I really want to make sure I teach him that we can all respect each other and work together. I most likely will not be watching this movie, because I'm seeing a lot of similar comments from people about the core message.",2023-07-21

"As a man who watched it and thought it was just okay, I think you nailed it with what they were going for with the Ken's. 

I literally just told my wife I thought Ken was representing how women were before the suffragist movement etc in the USA.

"No we get what the point is meant to be - however when you portray literally every man in the movie as an idiot doing something bad and the Barbies are not portrayed that way it can‚Äôt help but come off as men bad and women good. Even the Husband of America‚Äôs Ferrara is just randomly an idiot who is mocked.
How can we take it as a message of equality when the women in the real world struggling against patriachy are portrayed so positively yet the Kens are morons? Clearly it‚Äôs an uneven portrayal - if they had of made some of the barbies more villainous it might have worked in The way you describe as a plot as they would have reflected the real world men. However that wasn‚Äôt the case.

So we get what it‚Äôs meant to be however because of the constant portrayal of all men as stupid and male interests as dumb it just comes off as bitterness against men in a thin veneer of social critique.

It‚Äôs also hilarious how Mattel have rewritten history and convinced young women that Barbie is some feminist icon despite feminists protesting her for the first three decades of her existence.

Think about this - if a movie came out men liked that a lot of women were saying was woman hating in a way they didn‚Äôt like would your response be - ‚Äúwell clearly those women are wrong and they just don‚Äôt get it‚Äù? I doubt it, you would probably encourage men to actually consider that possibly they have a bias and blind spot that they aren‚Äôt aware of and the women have a point. Perhaps you should do the same in return and think about whether you as a woman are actually the best person to judge whether a movie should be offensive or considered man hating to men.",2023-07-23
"I love you for driving this analysis across so beautifully. 

There are so many people who are calling the film, ""anti-men"" but it's not. There were points in the film where I was scared it's going to become exactly that (especially towards the end. I almost thought the Kens are going to go back to being an accessory.) But I liked how it takes a step towards creating their own idea of equality in the Barbie land (with the men now getting a position in the supreme Court, regardless of it being lower or not.) 

I think the whole idea also is also to give us a taste of our own medicine through satire and challenge the roots of patriarchy and what it really means to be a human following these concepts.

"The point was that it mirrored the real world, where women had to inch their way into positions of power. And the Kens' situation parallels that of women in the real world. Theoretically Ken/a woman is now allowed into positions of power, but realistically those at the top are still reluctant to actually give them a chance, so the gender ratio is still not balanced.",2023-07-27
"It's being said as a joke. By contemplating Ken's reduced position of power in Barbieland, you are empathizing with the women's struggle in the real world. It's a ""funny because it's true"" kinda thing.

Edit: someone farther down explained it better-  

>The ending being a matriarchal society still is a joke about the real world. Sure, a lot of people will say women are equals now and should be treated as such, but the actual change that should come along with that never happened overnight and is still a work in progress. When women first started getting jobs, nobody was like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a seat in congress‚Äù. The movie isn‚Äôt saying that slow change for the kens is the way it‚Äôs supposed to be, it‚Äôs just reflecting how society actually baby steps towards equality instead of fully embracing it.

">Very much tell, not show

That seems to be pretty standard these days.  ""Show, not tell,"" used to be a writing maxim.  But I don't think it holds as much weight now.  ""Telling"" is normalized to some degree for younger generations of writers and moviegoers, so to them it's not looked down upon or particularly jarring.",2023-07-26
"I agree with everything here. I admit I spent the first 1/4 - 1/2 of the movie thinking Ken was a role reversal to highlight how mistreated women are -- after all, he isn't respected by the Barbies or other Kens, he has no status, he is the butt of every joke, he is excluded from the ""all girls"" party, and the narrator even says something to the effect of ""But Ken only has a good day if people look at him"". As a woman, these are all things I and my friends have felt at some point, and I thought they were setting up Ken to sort of ""reverse"" the idea so men could understand better or something. I didn't have a problem with that alongside Barbie doing her thing.

But then at the halfway point they have Ken getting into the patriarchy. Ok, I thought, now he wants to dismantle the Barbie matriarchy as a symbol, again, of how women want to change the RL patriarchy and gain some respect and power. Instead they show that him wanting to be respected and loved is wrong, he is just power hungry, and of course he is a complete idiot who can't do anything right. They go on to show that him wanting to change Barbie land is wrong, while at the same time they have Barbie telling the other Barbies how oppressed they are even though they just had a Barbie matriarchy. To be clear, this was not a movie about Ken nor do I want it to be, but it felt like a movie about Ken in the second half because a) Ken could change Barbie land but Barbie couldn't change RL, I guess, and b) Barbie wasn't shown actually wanting or doing anything (the original throughline was that the portal was weird and Barbie wanted to be perfect again, which wasn't really resolved except with a handwave that now she wanted to be human). I actually left the movie almost feeling like the message was that things *should not change* and that women are just crazy and should be happy with what they get, but I of course did not leave with that message because they made sure to give the speeches about how bad the patriarchy is.

Feel free to disagree or counter some of my perspective here. I am a woman who hasn't always fit in with my female friends because I don't always see things the same way and am somewhat analytical, even though I am liberal and do want change. Three people around me in the theater were crying at multiple scenes in this movie and I genuinely feel like I missed a huge part I was supposed to connect with as a woman.",2023-07-26
"Agreed. A lot of Telling instead of Showing, and I‚Äôd hoped those on-the-nose meta moments would evolve into an interesting perspective, but then the movie just pivoted away toward a different point altogether. I was very disappointed.",2023-07-26
"Did they want equality though? Because I've been trying to find what message the movie is trying to send and I'm having a tough time because it seems like every time it gets close to saying something except for it's lectures it under cuts it with a joke or a gag. 

The Kens are a great example. In the beginning they are treated as almost pets. Then when they have the patriarchy they are both extremely informed, capable and dumb as a rock. When the Barbies regain control instead of equality they go back to complete domination. 

The message that he's kenough is good but he was literally made to be with Barbie. It's not a great metaphor made worse by him never actually doing anything but stating that.

Then the patriarchy. Somehow all these strong women can suddenly get pulled into it until an independent woman showed them they actually want to be independent? What was that suppose to be? 

It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't a good one and it really was muddy in terms of messaging.",2023-08-11
"I just watched *Barbie*, and was also confused by the theme.  I can't figure out what it was.

* It wasn't a ""You go, girl"" theme because the initial Barbie utopia was insipid, unfulfilling for stereotypical Barbie and was overturned in a day by Ken.

* It wasn't a ""Women should run the world"" theme because Barbie treated Ken like an object.

* It wasn't a ""anti-patriarchy"" theme because Ken didn't get anywhere in the real world asserting his male privilege and when Ken took over Barbie world, everyone was having fun.  I don't understand why or how the Barbies had been brainwashed.

* It wasn't a ""pro-masculinity"" theme because Ken wasn't doing any better.  Why were horses such a big part of Ken's manliness?  Young girls are much more fond of horses than men are.

* There wasn't an antagonist or bad guy like in *The Lego Movie*.

" The reason there are no fat Ken's is itself a critique of unrealistic female and male beauty standards in the real world.

The absence of diverse body types among the Ken dolls in the movie may be a conscious choice to highlight and critique the often narrow and unrealistic standards of male beauty. Just like Barbie has historically been criticized for promoting unrealistic body ideals for women, Ken can be seen as representing a similar issue for men. The typical Ken doll represents an ""ideal"" male physique‚Äîtall, muscular, and lean. This single body type could be seen as reinforcing harmful standards of attractiveness and masculinity.

The film seems to challenge these standards by including characters such as Allan, described as ""bumbling awkwardly in a sea of hunky Kens."" Allan's inclusion might serve as a contrast to the homogeneity of the Ken dolls and as a critique of the limited representation of male body types.

Moreover, the film is set in Barbieland, a world originally constructed around the dolls' specific aesthetic. This limitation, however, does not mean that the filmmakers are endorsing this single body type as the ideal. Rather, they may be using it to highlight the problems with such an unrealistic standard.

Ultimately, the movie appears to encourage individuality and self-definition over conformity to specific body ideals, both for Barbie and Ken.

There are different layers to the themes but I still kind of feel like a coherent whole is missing that prevents this movie from being truly great.

For some reason it reminded me of Marvel's shows/movies, esp those related to Cap America like the TV show with Falcon and Winter Soldier. They would raise these interesting questions / topics like refugees and so on but always find some lame way to not resolve the tough questions and distract you with something else in the end.

">  It seems it wants to talk about something very insightful and important,

There was a scene when Barbie is in the real world, and sitting at a bus stop looking at an old woman, and some girl kids and she has an 'emotional moment'.  And I get why someone 'could' be that emotional about an old woman being confident in a bus stop, or a kid just playing, but in the context of the movie it felt uninformed and unearned that it felt corny to me, a dude.

That said, I can see how that same scene, for an actual IRL woman with a childhood of interacting and playing with barbies in a parasocial manner, that one TikTox sized clip of Barbie telling an old woman that she's beautiful can be extremely validating and emotional.  But again, that requires the viewer to be bringing in a lot of IRL context into the movie.

It's writing, if it's meant for a wider audience, especially movie critics, it's pretty meh and thinly played out more style than substance, like the Star Wars sequel Trilogies.  If it's meant for just people who played with barbies, then it's fine.",2023-10-20
"Also just finished watching it. I'm pretty sure your exact comment is exactly the point of the movie (or one of them). After the supreme court thing they even joke that maybe one day kens will have as much power as women in the real world. The point is that neither the patriarchy or matriarchy are good and are actually just as bad as each other and we need to work to make things equal across both.

This point is reinforced when the kens first take over and Ken echoes the same arguments against barbie that she made against him when the barbies were in power: ""this is barbies dream house not kens dream house"".

At the end when the babies are taking back control Barbie ( our protagonist), even says she doesn't think things should go back to the way they were, ie women in total control, it's just the other barbies need to catch up to her",2024-01-17

And speaking of Ken the himbo - when Ken the doll was the President and Barbie was the First Lady in doll form - was he a himbo? What about when they brought out doctor Men and nurse Barbie? Or Pilot Ken and flight attendant Barbie? 
I don‚Äôt have a problem with Ken being a himbo but the whole thing about Mattel only ever giving Barbie jobs is just social media spin for this movie.

I grew up hearing about ""negative female portrayals"" in TV shows/movies/video games all the time, even if it was only one woman and their portrayals often weren't even negative; Lara Croft is an example of a female character who was a smart, capable, adventurous badass but was in the crosshairs of feminist critics for being sexualised. Every piece of media with so much as a damsel in distress has come under fire for it.

Yet whenever we get shows or movies with male characters who are *all* portrayed as either stupid, lazy, condescending, predatory, etc. we're not allowed to call them out? At best, you get told ""you can't have a laugh at your own expense"", like you did, or ""women have had to deal with it for decades, it's about time the pendulum swung in the other direction"" (ignoring the decades of media with negative portrayals of men too. I can go and watch Laurel and Hardy movies where I'm supposed to laugh at them being victims of domestic violence. Pick any sitcom and you'll see a bumbling, stupid husband and a smart wife rolling her eyes). At worst, you get called an evil sexist alt-right incel virgin MRA manbaby for calling it out.

"Wouldn't putting Barbie on the board just validate that women are there not because they earned the spot but because of tokenism? Barbie doesn't have an MBA or any job experience.

I think that a lot of the people who didn't like the movie seem to all think there should have been a fairy tale ending - Barbieland is now a utopia of equality and Barbie is fixing the real world by making feminist strides in the workplace. But the Barbies are all reflections of the children playing with them - they can't be fixed any faster than the real world can. Not to mention that the Kens had literally brainwashed them all into something akin to slavery - and were about to change the Constitution to strip them of their rights forever. Why do the Barbies need to rise above? Why do women or blacks or insert oppressed/wronged party have to rise above? The Kens certainly didn't when they got their power after being marginalized. I know that it has to start somewhere, but who does that fall on?",2023-07-24

Also, I felt like there could've have been more done with Ken as you pointed out though, I understand that Barbie is meant to be the focus of the movie. Anyways, love this review and thanks for sharing!",2023-07-24
"Great analysis! I totally agree with most of the points. They could have gone waaaay deeper in the topic of ""human experience"" and that type of things, but they wanted to tackle so many things at once that in the end it was kind of messy. 

Also, I have to take in consideration that there was definitely an understimation for Ken, as you said, it would have been great to see them fully collaborate with the Barbies, and to see the ""main"" Ken (Ryan Gosling) take the same route as the ""main"" Barbie in the real world, living as a human, showing the maturity and development of the character.

I think they were really close to making a really solid movie, but it ended up a bit weak in terms of plot and messages.

"I don't think it was Ken's crying that was played for laughs, it was Ken's *running away to cry* that was played for laughs.  That's why it was so easy to laugh at his ""I'm a liberated male and it's strong to cry"", because he said it right after he ran from his peers to cry in private.  Ken said those words out loud, but he might not believe them",2023-07-24
"I thought there were really interesting and unique themes about men‚Äôs mental health and how men experience the world. At first, Ken is invisible unless Barbie is giving him attention. Then, Ken discovers the patriarchy and overthrows Barbieland, but they end up trashing the place and looking ridiculous (toxic masculinity). Barbie says to Ken that he‚Äôs enough just as he is, and doesn‚Äôt need all of the superficial stuff to feel good enough. Basically, men should be themselves and have inherent value that‚Äôs got nothing to do with women, cars, their clothes, etc. I was kind of taken aback by the themes about men‚Äôs issues, just wasn‚Äôt expecting it. Unfortunately the end of the movie kind of invalidated those themes they were building on. It felt like we were supposed to laugh at Ken crying about the minfridge. Idk, men are made to feel like they can‚Äôt express sadness. Should we be laughing at him crying? Or should we root for him for showing true emotion? Also, Ken crying about a mini fridge made it seem like men have trivial issues compared to women. That may be true sometimes, but is it always?

I would have appreciated 1) consistency across themes. If the movie develops a theme or message, stick to it through to the end and 2) a more nuanced approach on issues that are, well, truly nuanced.",2023-07-24
"I thought it might be a hot take to say it but I do think they kind of really beat on Ken in this movie. I thought it was going to build up to the barbies and Ken's mutually respecting one another and treating them as individuals and stop using them as ""superfluous"" man accessories and accept them as meaningful parts of their lives. But no they just sort of go back to being Ken's. I thought it was kinda fucked up that Barbie mentions how she doesn't even know where all the Ken's sleep at night. Ken loves someone who doesn't live him back, he has no power at all in his world, and isn't qualified to get a job or have any power in the real world, like no wonder dude did what he did. I thought they were going to build up to tackle some men's mental health issues and struggles but it just boils down to ""Sorry Ken, you're valid I guess""",2023-07-24

"It seemed pretty clear to me that the obvious enemy of the film was gender inequality in and of itself, and that each of us (regardless of gender) operate within the inequities of this framework and leads us to act and feel a certain way: it wasn't ""women are better than men"" or ""all men are dumb,"" it was ""wouldn't it be nice to have a bit more balance?""",2023-07-27

"The problem is it shows a feminist idea that ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is bad for men by showing Gosling Ken cry and then get to find himself when the women take over and ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is defeated  - but it‚Äôs just that that is a feminist woman‚Äôs fantasy of what she thinks men should want. 95% of men aren‚Äôt secretly wanting to cry more or find themselves so the idea that ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is bad for them because it‚Äôs holding them back from doing so doesn‚Äôt mean anything to them at all. So what seems like a happy ending to feminist women is actually entirely meaningless to most men and in no way shows them patriarchy is bad for them and they‚Äôd be better without it, because it‚Äôs just a feminists idea of what is better for them, not their own.

Also the reason it‚Äôs anti men isn‚Äôt so much the ideas it espouses whether you agree with them or not - but the fact all the real world male characters and Kens are portrayed as morons who are doing bad stuff, whereas the real world women are sympathetic and competent and the barbies are more intelligent and competent and cooperative than the Kens.

"The movie definitely is supposed to be satire, but the conclusion Barbie arrives at on where she sees herself in society and how she wants society to interact and respect her is meant to be taken serious. And as soon as she takes her own agency back, she kind of denies Ken his by telling him he doesn't get a supreme court seat unless she feels like it down the road. With the justification being, ""well men do it to us in the real world"" - which the movie goes indepth to criticize. So it's understandable when people see her using that excuse as vindictive rather than satirical. Ken didn't cause the real world to be hostile towards women. So why would you shut him down, especially since he comes around to accepting Barbies viewpoint in the end and follows her example to want more agency over his own life, rather than just looking pretty on a beach?

That making it for a joke just because it‚Äôs a male character upset me.

While this does prompt laughs because of how *good* Gosling is at physical comedy, I feel like it's treated well within the scene.

"I'm not gonna lie, the fact that so many viewers beeline it to the most uncharitable, simplistic view of the film and what its message was is very concerning. 

It's about becoming human. When Gloria's chafing under having to do everything while her husband enjoys the benefits of the labour done, and pursuing her passion projects, then Gloria going wherever the fuck she pleases *for once* is, in fact an act of making a choice to be more than she has been so far, namely a wife, a working bee, a mother ticking from one day to another. Her husband does not appear to be interested in the slightest, about doing the same with himself, or even just going along with his wife, even out of curiosity. 

She's unconcerned about her husband because her husband is not concerned about her. I mean, your wife and kid take off and you don't even think to ask 'where you're going, when will you be back, what chores need doing, what's a Barbie, who's this strange blonde woman.' There's nothing really there for Gloria to be concerned about because her husband seems to be about as exciting, complex and complicated as a, well, plastic Barbie.

You probably didn‚Äôt realise it but the ending of Ken crying while the Barbies take power back and Barbie womansplaining that now he gets to go and find himself and cry is actually what feminists think is a happy ending. It‚Äôs a representation of how when ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù is beaten and women have more power men will be able to find themselves and express all the emotions they secretly want to express - according to feminists.

Is Barbie--or women in general--not worthy to have an adoring dude?  Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse did a much better job of this.  Also Greta's treatment of ""weird Barbie"" was cruel and depicted a ""mean girl"" element that I don't think reflects the Barbie brand in general.

I honestly can't even remember what her character's name was. 

I dunno, maybe have Barbie actually experience the real world beyond just a boardwalk and middle school? Have her notice and see the struggles women go through instead of a Scooby-Doo chase? It would have made way more sense for Margot Robbie to be the one with the big monologue highlighting women's struggles after an actual emotional arc.

There were so many corners cut in this film that just don't make sense.

First in the context of the movie, Barbie has never been confronted to mortality - and thus getting old either. This was her beginning to see the beauty in humanity and what it entails - getting old and dying, having a limited time on earth and using it to evolve.

And from a more meta point of view, it is also a sort of feminist scene : Barbie doesn't see a woman getting old as a negative because she developed in a society that's basically the opposite of a patriarchy. The movie's saying that despite what mysogny says, there's beauty in a woman getting old. It's even more powerful considering it's coming from Barbie, who's the embodiment of each of our society's beauty standards.",2023-07-25

Also, the kens were never really oppressed by the Barbies in the first place. They were always happy. Had no reality of self - sure, but that's because of the nature of their existence. Oppressed is a pretty strong term.

Also I think the end is open-ended for a reason. I think they may make a film titled Ken in the future because just like you, I was kinda dissatisfied with the fact that we didn't get to know what happened to Ken. I think a film navigating his journey to finding who he is would be cool. 

It'd be so cool if they make one for Midge and Allan too!!",2023-07-23

But well, in the end when it finally divulges into the protagonist feeling an existential crisis and the need of knowing who she really is, I thought I'd be able to connect and feel the emotions and I could not. The dialogues were quite meh. The America Ferrera monologue everyone talked about is pretty clich√© and ordinary. Perhaps even rhetorical. 

When Ruth is talking to Barbie towards the end, I turned around to see if anyone actually felt what the writers were supposed to make them feel. I did find one girl in the theatre crying. But she was the only one. Many others looked as disinterested as I did. I think the feminism talked about in the movie is quite shallow. But that's not even my concern.

The Kens are still in BarbieLand, with a fully-female supreme court, having to ask for a position, for scraps, and being overjoyed at being given said scraps - Which is still more than they had before. Does it feel disappointing? It has to, or else it doesn't pass its message. Barbie is not a feel-good movie. It's uncomfortable, a lot of the messages are straightforward, but many others are less so. 

Those that are less clear/straightforward are those that will leave us men uncomfortable. And I feel it makes us ask women around us ""Did you get it?"", while they can answer with ""Hell yes I do"". It leads to a conversation.",2023-08-19
"I think the meaning of the CEO of Mattel is in conjunction with Ruth, the creator of Barbie. Together they symbolizes different facets of our parents - the CEO represents our parent‚Äôs expectations that defines who we are by raising us according to that definition. No matter how well intended that is, each person still has to become their own person in their own terms or else the parents‚Äô expectations will always be a burden on them. 

The CEO wanting Barbie to go back to the box and stay as ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù Barbie where she can be this perfect little doll are like parents that wants their children to be exactly how they are raised. Some parents raise their kids to be an extension of their own egos, some raise them to behave and to fit into society (hence, being ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù), some raise them to be successful, some raise them to know good, etc‚Ä¶the spectrum can go pretty far from end to end.

Ruth, on the other hand, represents the realization that their own child one day will outgrow the confines of the parents‚Ä¶these confines are necessary for a child to reach adulthood, they are filled with ideas and expectations for them to learn and understand the basics of the world, typically this is where being ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù are idealized. But every child needs to decide for themselves eventually who they are and what want to be.

This is distinct from the ideas of masculinity, patriarchy, feminism, and etc‚Ä¶for these things are social concepts we come to know as we are being integrated into society when we leave home. But the image of who we are instilled by our parents is much deeper and intimate. Yet as well meaning and lovingly as this image is, it is still an idea and not who we are. Though we may incorporate from it, we can never be it because an idea is still a box at the end and everyone has to eventually grow out of that box to become a fully realized person.

At the end, the ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù Barbie becomes an actual woman named Barbra, who is not defined by the concepts and ideas, she‚Äôs more than that and that is what living is, and this is what being a human means.

That being said, this is the final point the movie is trying to convey I think‚Ä¶and this point is only more poignant when we see the CEO in that light (if we take what the CEO said in face value, he does not fit in this mode of evil capitalism, because he rejected several times bad ideas that make money‚Ä¶especially bad ideas that harms the image of what Barbie is. At the same time, their ideas for Barbie were all stale because they too can only come up with so many as long as Barbie is still in a box).",2023-08-19
"There's a wonderful and fucked up game called Pathologic, whose entire overarching concept revolves around three protagonists, two of them who start out as dolls: simple things to play with, who march along their intended path as determined by creatures more whole and unknowable and complex than they are. How toys and the act of playing is preparing for actual life, but simply not sufficient to be considered a living, thinking, breathing thing. That while there are limited paths you can take, but even choosing between two pre-laid tracks is still a choice, and that you, the player, and the characters cannot become fully fledged and complex humans until you make a choice to stop playing and go outside to touch grass.

The genius in the ludonarrative of the game lies in the fact that it is a game made by Russians, about Russia. With how much global ire Russians are drawing for apparently being so apathetic and disinterested not just in the fate of others, but their own fate, it ruminates on whether it is possible forfeit so much choice, to keep on walking with your head down, fearful and disinterested and entirely unwilling to try different paths, that you can no longer really even call yourself a human, or even cattle, because even cattle protest and question things, but a toy? A toy never does.  It just does what it's made to do, it is what the player says it is. It doesn't care, it doesn't show curiosity, it doesn't ever define itself, or even cares to. A toy does not use the word 'I' and make a choice, it is not interested in change, it *cannot* change,

 'Just Ken' became an actual person the moment he chose to accept himself as 'just Ken', a thinking creature full of potential. Barbie became an actual human when she chose to leave the game world and, well, go outside of her play castle and go touch some goddamned grass. To leave the simple play world behind where she's safely practiced and played at being a real and complex thing without suffering the consequences of real life and real decisions. Those who aren't ready yet to leave Barbie world are still working towards becoming the most complex version of themselves, and they too will likely leave when they are ready to make that choice.

You yourself are a little more than a toy if you allow people to treat you as one. You will stop being a toy and a simple, 2D creature, when you go and face all that you've been practicing for. So answer me this. What are *you*? Your name. Who you are today. If you're willing to change or evolve from what you are in the future. If the answer to this is 'yes', then congratulations of leaving Barbieland, you're a real human creature making choices about your life and existence to the best of your ability.",2023-10-17

"i agree. Way too many themes. I came out of the theater kinda empty. It was funny but not a comedy because some theme felt too heavy but, at the same time, the film lacked depth. The film itself felt like it was going through an identity crisis, trying to figure out what it is and what it wants to say. 

I honestly think the film should have turned the opening scene on its head and show Barbie encounter motherhood for the first time. Barbie has been everything except a mom. Not that she becomes a mom at the end but maybe exploring and taking more time with the mom and daughter characters (Sasha and Gloria) and having Barbie see what real life is (the good and the bad). When Ken went off and discovered the patriarchy and went back to Barbieland, that‚Äôs when the movie died for me. They went in the wrong direction. Also the Mattel guys were a complete waste of time. 

I was excited for the film to be about the female experience, from childhood to adulthood. The director did a masterful job with Ladybird, I was expecting that caliber of depth and nuance and heart with Barbie. 

Show women being women and Barbie seeing real women in the real world and helping them but also letting them help her. How the real world differs from the hyper positivity and femininity of Barbieland, why it‚Äôs good and why it‚Äôs bad. Kinda like Enchanted (ugh but that‚Äôs already been done!)

UNLESS the story went the opposite direction and the mom and daughter character were brought to Barbieland earlier and they have to go on an adventure through Barbieland including other Barbie locations from the various Barbie movies. In the end this could have represented the mom and daughter bonding while playing with Barbies and marathoning Barbie movies over like a weekend (not like the ‚ÄúIt was all a dream‚Äù trope but something similar with symbolism and heart)",2023-07-28

"They should have stuck with the whole Barbie having a crisis about who she is. It was never really resolved satisfactorily because they just barreled from that theme into heavy handed feminist stuff.
Seems like an original idea about Barbie the doll representing the brand and having a mid life crisis got largely forgotten in the middle of the movie, because Greta Gerwig badly wanted to talk about patriachy.",2023-07-28
"Saw it last night and I feel similarly. Not sure it said everything it thought it was saying.  


I think the duality was outright stated in the America Ferrera speech - women are in a double bind, too smart or too stupid or too much or not enough. The movie is in the same bind - is it funny or is it sad, is it smart or is it shallow? Feminist or misandrist? Maybe this is the point, the form being the message, but I left feeling like... yeah... we knew this. I liked hearing it out loud but I didn't feel it was a unique commentary.  


I also hated the last line for similar reasons. The fun-ness of womanhood was celebrated genital-free for the whole runtime, I'm not sure why it would be the closing sentiment and sign of real womanhood. The whole theater laughed and I cringed, especially after loving Hari the whole time.",2023-07-28
"You could really feel the assignment. You could really feel Greta‚Äôs need to please multiple sects of barbie fans and stakeholders. It almost felt like a defensively told story. It hurts a story or a comedy when you can feel the effort from the filmmaker to get ahead of internet comments or please all kinds of people. This happens with IP and reboots. It‚Äôs a tedious watch for me when I can feel that. 

Your comment on the last line is a great example of what she was very careful to try to avoid, and the audience could feel it. In the end you can‚Äôt please everyone, they‚Äôll always find something, so just stay true to your vision. In this case, and maybe just what the movie needed to be, her vision was a scattershot of teachable messages and themes to please all niches of Barbie and feminism communities, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the most successful approach to telling a story. That said, this movie is pure marketing and very carefully told to optimize success",2023-07-28
"Love the points you bring up in your first couple paragraphs.

My question would be, was Gerwig actually trying to appeal to each of these different groups? Or was she trying to represent them and the conflict between various groups of feminists, to critique both?   


My take is, I don‚Äôt think Gerwig intended to have a take on Barbie at all. Barbie represents something different to each character- just like in real life. I think Gerwig did an excellent job in presenting each side in nuanced ways, while not shying away from critiquing either one.   


Take Barbie for example. She represents new wave, #girlboss, lipstick feminism that reclaims hyper-feminism and abandons traditional gender roles to pursue her own dreams. All great in theory. Yet, we also see when she arrives at the real world, she quickly learns that this hasn‚Äòt magically solved everyone‚Äôs problems. In the cafeteria scene, Barbie is rightfully portrayed as delusional and naive for believing herself to be a feminist savior to all.

This rings true of criticisms made against new wave feminism in real life- particularly that it promotes unrealistic standards for all but a privileged group of women; that the reclaiming of hyper-femininity and sexuality isn‚Äôt fighting for a real cause like early feminists did- which seems a bit frivolous to focus on, especially when other women are literally risking their lives and dying to fight for equality in other parts of the world.   


Then we have the other side, America Ferrera‚Äôs daughter. She represents 2nd wave feminism, which rejects femininity as a tool of patriarchy- and seeks to uplift women left behind by the first wave of feminism, which only fought for white women. She brings up great points, like how idealized white beauty standards and lack of representation in meds affect non-white girls growing up. 

Which is fine, but in the process she displays a certain anger and contempt towards the Barbies. She refuses to help them at first. She rejects pink and makes fun of their clothes as being a result patriarchal brainwashing, rather than a rejection of it. This also true of real life criticisms of this wave- instead of supporting all women and their right to choose what empowers them, they end up ‚Äùusing feminism as a stick to beat over other women‚Äôs heads‚Äù when they make choices that don‚Äôt align with their values. 

So, I don‚Äôt think Gerwig intended to appeal to either group. I think she attended for both sides to have some self-reflection to do at the end. It‚Äôs not as simple as one being right, and one being wrong. They both have valid points and valid criticism. 

Lastly, I would argue that the film refraining from choosing a side as ‚Äúright‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt conclusion. In fact, i would argue that is the conclusion. In the end, it takes both groups working together to save Barbieland from the Kens. It‚Äôs this alliance that makes them successful. Personally, I think think this is a much more powerful message. The message that if women stopped fighting each other, and instead empowered each other to fight the patriarchy together, we could make real change. Because that‚Äôs what feminism is, right? Empowering and supporting women to make choices different from our own.",2023-07-28

">I loved America Ferrera's speech about women and the ridiculous standards and expectations placed on us.

I assume you're in North America but I'm genuinely curious, do you actually feel these 'ridiculous standards and expectations' in this day and age? And is it coming from men and women, or primarily other women?

I ask because in my industry (finance), the majority (if not all) women come in to work with little to no makeup, no high heels and it's not even a topic of discussion. A number of companies within my industry also have mandates to increase the hiring of women, so women generally are highly coveted in the workplace. I know there's been more of a push now than before but I just have never experienced a situation where a woman has been disadvantaged. Sexualized, yes, that may never change unfortunately. However, a number of the women I speak with mention that they end up using it to their advantage to get what they want (i.e., reaching sales targets). 

For what its worth, I'm in my late 20s, and I understand that my experience might be limited and that's why I'm curious to get your thoughts and others.",2023-12-16

If men can't grasp the way the movie showcases patriarchy being bad for both men and women, when it's shown so obviously in this way, I can't say it's due to filmmakers not making a convincing argument.

Not really. You kind of nail the point that the movie is just an ad. Everything about the plot and story is just a convenient way to market dolls to consumers and try to justify it with a meta commentary spin and some fancy sets and dance numbers.

> On the one hand, the central conflict somewhat acknowledges the struggles of incel-y men and urges Ken to find his own path.

It's amazing how corporate gaslighting affects American culture. Using words like patriarchy, incels, and Barbie is mind blowingly stupid personally. No offense to you, it's criticism of the movie, not your comment. Ryan Gosling's character's motivations are some Hollywood stereotype of an Andrew Tate type of character.

How about the subtle racism in the movie? Making the black Barbie say motherfucker, giving the black Ken a pimp coat, the token black president while in real life, black Americans are still largely segregated to low income slum communities and exploited by Hollywood as ghetto entertainment for suburban white people.

> So the movie didn‚Äôt really make me feel like the conflict mattered or made sense.

"A compelling analysis, although:

> The movie made the mistake that most people that try to portray a matriarchy did, in that it just swapped the labels, but kept the contents the same and, in doing so, tip-toed right over the point. 

Didn't the movie acknowledge this at the end? It's the key point that resolves the Barbie/Ken conflict (the Kenflict?)

> Will Ferrel's character would have been such a perfect way to showcase how powerful men enforce negative patriarchal ideals on other men around them while paying lip service to feminism,

I thought Ferrell's CEO character did that. What do you think was missing?

> how easily a disillusioned and isolated man can miss the nuance and just blame women for his feelings of inadequacy.

Ken explicitly showed this at the end, no?

> It would also have been nice to see how Ken was able to influence the other men and how some of the Barbies might have fallen for it, because that absolutely happens in real life.

I'm not sure what you mean here ‚Äî I thought the movie did exactly this in the sequence after >!Barbie/Gloria/Sasha return to Barbieland-as-Kendom and one of the Barbies lauds how easy it was to not have to make decisions!<.

That said, I don't think patriarchy diminishes women's need to decide ‚Äî far from it; I think women instead end up having to make thousands of decisions about how to best suit erratic men's desires ‚Äî  so I wasn't sure that reasoning landed.

Your point about self-image issues and Robbie is sharp, and I agree with it. I think, though, that Gerwig and Baumbach were in a bit of a bind. (I suppose) they likely thought that if they had just had Barbie-Margot feel bad about her self-image, some women might just respond, 'what does someone who looks like Margot Robbie have to complain about?' I'd give them the benefit of the doubt that they were trying to 'inb4' such a response, although their chosen solution wasn't great.

I had a few Barbies and a Ken when I was a kid so I was somehow intrigued how would they do the story. It started out okay, but then made me think about some aspects in my life which tbh I preferred not to. Not that it's bad to talk about such things, it's just that it makes it a bit tedious.

The narrator told us the Kens were going to work hard and make progress until they're where women are at IRL today.

If a watcher already believes the world is a fully equal place today, that line means it's a happy ending.  

If a watcher thinks ""same amount of power as women"" has a negative connotation, there might be a call to examine ""why"" that negative connotation exists, and what can we do about that.

It's funny that that she mentioned men get points just for participating, while women have to actually work for their goals, because I hear that talking point a lot from men, but with the sexes reversed.

But then the narrarator said Ken would have the same rights in Barbieworld as women had in out world and it turns out the supreme court in the real world didn't have a single woman judge for the first 198 years. The mean spirited satire illuminates the mean spirited reality, we're just not used to seeing it inflicted on men. It makes me wonder why we're so used to seeing women treated like that",2023-07-23
"Definitely agree with you re: Gloria. Initially, her motivations are about not being connected with her daughter and feeling sad/lost - but it's not really clear that this is ever meaningfully resolved. Gloria and the daughter seem to have a better relationship at the end of the movie for no particular reason (the daughter is a staunch opposer of Barbie initially, but drops this immediately upon getting to Barbieland). Gloria is central to resolving the plot with her speeches, but we never really get a great sense of why Gloria even feels that way except a generic ""all women feel this way"" implied reasoning. It doesn't seem to have a lot to do with either her quasi-suicidal thoughts or her relationship with her daughter. And then as you say, we don't really get a resolution to Gloria's plotline.

I enjoyed it in lots of ways! There were lots of good parts and it was good fun. Worth the price of a cinema ticket. But you have to kind of squint around the plot sometimes because too much is packed in and a lot of it goes somewhat unaddressed.",2023-07-24

">Then, what idea does Farerra pitch at the very end that is so great that Farrell hates until he learns it'll be profitable? Average Barbie. The thing that exists and we spent a whole movie on: Stereotypical Barbie.

Stereotypical Barbie isn't the average woman. She's the archetypical Barbie. She's perfect. Her days are perfect. Her house is perfect. Her food is perfect. She lives a life of leisure. Everything about her is the perfect encapsulation of what it is to be a classic Barbie doll.

Average Barbie is Barbie with a job that she's working because she needs the money rather than because it's what she aspires to, in a house that's good enough for now, who's just trying to get through the day with some happy thoughts.

>Ken goes into the real world and learns about ""patriarchy"" but sees that the real world doesn't actually work like that. Kens have no jobs or positions of power in Barbieland, but women have jobs in the real world. He runs into a doctor, but he arbitrarily asks to see the real doctor (ie a man) because he just learned of patriarchy, despite having lived a life where women are doctors. He goes around and asks to do surgery but learns that he can't do that just because he's a man, he needs credentials. So, how is he still believing in patriarchy and trying to push it in Barbieland when most of what he has experienced condradicts it?

Most of what he's experienced hasn't contradicted it. What he likes about patriarchy is that it makes him feel validated as a man. He's not And Ken under patriarchy. He thinks it could be Ken and Barbie.",2023-07-22

Umm. It's exactly problem many young men have. They were taught to define themselves by how good they can get a women. Ken thought he was nothing unless he could get Barbie.

>but ditches her in the real world for patriarchy.

Ken didn't ditch her for the patriachy. He thought patriachy would help him get her. Do you think young men love the patriachy and showing themselves as alpha because they hate women? No! They think patriachy will help them get the girls. 

In the end, ""Ken is me"" is what Barbie wanted Ken, and young men to understand. We don't need to ""be men"". There is no single definition of men that young men have to try to be. ""Man is me"" is what the misled young men needs to learn.

I've seen a lot of articles have the take that the ken arc is about male fragility and yes there is that to a degree but also you got a society where the Kens are forced to be all uneducated beach bums with no places to live and are literally just objects to the Barbies. Which is unarguably bad and unequal.

Kens solution to this is of course bad but the state things are left in at the end of the movie is basically ""And then the Barbies told them they were equal now but just made their matriarchy more subtle"" Which its like... Given the rest of the movie it raises the question if this is supposed to be a ""The struggle for equality is an uphill battle in which even the most benevolent ruling class will always try their best to maintain power"" message ending or a ""Actually this is how things should be"" message ending or a ""This will really piss off a certain group of men on the internet trolollolololol male tears"" message ending.",2023-07-22

That said the visuals and the humor of the movie more than made up for the heavy handedness/bad messaging, I loved it",2023-07-22
"My take on Kens in Barbieland isn't so much that they have to be suppressed for Barbieland to be restored -- I'm pretty sure there was someone there who said to restore the world, but not like how it was before. 

Barbieland has had women working their whole lives, and the Kens have never worked a day in their life other than beaching. They wanted equal seating with Barbie in congress in the end, the Barbies offered an entry job so that they can eventually catch up. 

In a presumed 'patriarchy real world', women would be expected to work entry level jobs too and work themselves up. It would be fair that way. So I thought it was reasonable for it to happen to Kens too.

I overall liked the movie a lot, though I did feel a little weird at the end too. I think for me it was more about them packing too much in/ trying to tackle too many concepts associated with the Barbie brand in too little time.",2023-07-22
"> the Barbies insisted on re-subjugating the Kens

I mean, the narrator told us they'd make progress over time and end up in the same position women are at in the real world. Does that sound like a 'bad end' to people watching for some reason? If so, *why*?

I'm pretty sure that's what the movie wanted people to ask when they chose to end that part on that 'joke.'

>Yet when the Kens do the same thing when they are even more repressed in Barbieland, they are vilified and their work must be undone to restore Barbieland

I did not have the impression that the original Barbieland was considered to be an *actual* utopia either. Both versions had issues that were apparent by the end, and I think that's a decent part of why Barbie chose to leave. 

In the new Barbieland, Kens were (eventually) going to work their way up (like women did) to wield as much power as 'women do in the real world.' If it feels like that's a bad thing, the 'whys' should probably be examined. 

Plenty of inspirational movies end on a ""...and that's how women gained the right to wear jeans"" type-note, and that's typically considered to be a 'good ending' in the context of the time and setting they're starting from, right?

>Therefore, it follows logically that‚Ä¶ men in the real world should stop women‚Äôs efforts to gain their own rights and power? Or, should men just be subjected in both worlds?

They didn't give a speech about the contradictions men face re: expectations like the Barbies got, but I think the subtext was there on purpose.

The CEO for example, was pretty sincere in his efforts to *not* put profits before legitimate attempts to advance 'female empowerment.'",2023-07-22

Ken is treated like a POS the whole time and instead of acknowledging that he is treated poorly, they villianize him for bringing the patriarchy and then are very conniving in ""overthrowing"" Ken. Like they missed the vote so it's totally cool to have a governing body make a decision when half the people weren't even there. Just so stupid and sending a terrible message. And at the end, Ken asks for one supreme court seat just to be represented and they are like hell no, you can be an assistant.

She's not a person with hopes and dreams, and flaws and drawbacks and perspectives and failures and imperfection. And the same goes for Ken. They're not bad or flawed or need to be fixed, they can't be human /because/ they're perfect. They're abstract concepts and ideas of perfection marketed as a human possibility that there's just not. And Barbie being such an icon of western culture has definitely made such a narrow minded philosophy a trojan horse in culture for how we view ourselves as people. Ken just needs to be proud and Barbie just needs to be accomplished but being human is much more than that, it's cellulite and binge-eating and judgement and anger and hatred and tragedy.

"> the way Barbies emotionally manipulated the Kens against each other

I loved the movie and am a big time feminist but this plot point bothered me a bit too. Whereas your concern was that people might think those types of manipulative games are OK, my concern was that people would think 'wow that manipulation is bad and of course it's exactly the sort of thing ~women~ would do because women are terrible like that and even the Barbie movie admits it'

Sure some women (and men) might do something like that to make a love interest *jealous* and get their attention, which isn't good but can happen especially when people are younger. But doing that specifically to get the men angry with *each other*, that's a different thing. In reality a woman doing what the Barbies did would risk the spurned man turning his anger on her for flirting with another guy. It would be giving the spurned man 2 potential targets for his anger, either the other guy or her, and it'd just be bad strategy to put yourself in the mix as a possible target that way if the *whole purpose* is to get the men fighting each other.   

The Barbies were like ""oh of course, we're women so naturally we'll rely solely on our specific feminine wiles to manipulate these men."" I mean, acting like that is the sort of thing such allegedly accomplished women would do didn't seem very feminist to me. They could have gotten the Kens fighting with each other over any thing that men might be inclined to argue or fight over. Like, 'psst, Ken! that other Ken said that your favorite horse sucks, and he thinks your take on the Godfather is trash and that you suck at guitar' or something.",2023-08-27

"Agreed. I had so many friends tell me how good it was, and well, I was just disappointed. It fell flat for me.

To your point about the battle of the sexes, I 100% agree that it felt like there was a message that there has to be a matriarchal or patriarchal society and that both sexes cannot share power which was disappointing. In Barbieland, it‚Äôs a girls‚Äô world and the guys are there to serve, and in the real world it‚Äôs exactly the opposite with no examples of women in power which isn‚Äôt fully the case in our society. While yes, women do get cat-called and don‚Äôt always get the respect we deserve, we do have some women in power in our society. When Gloria breaks the spell of patriarchy cast on the Barbies (which feels SO corny to me) it was frustrating because nothing she said was new. Saying that girls can‚Äôt be too loud or they‚Äôll be labeled as bossy but if they‚Äôre too quiet then they‚Äôre a pushover (I‚Äôm paraphrasing here) just felt like entertainment shining a light on all of the problems women face with no solution in sight. 

Some other things that bothered me‚Ä¶

1. I saw some bold and deliberate moves of casting a black woman, Issa Rae, as a president (about damn time) and I loved the representation of Simu Liu (he‚Äôs just an incredible and diverse actor). HOWEVER, I also noticed how the main characters were white: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and Will Ferrell who all held positions of power at some point in the film. Again, all incredible actors but also very interesting that the story revolves mostly around white actors. It‚Äôs also noteworthy to mention that Gloria (America Ferrera) is the person who made the story happen who is a Latina, someone who does not look like stereotypical Barbie because of white-washed America. Because Gloria creating conflict with her sad sketches is so central to the story, I feel like her character never got closure or the character development that was deserved. Sure, we see Gloria and Sasha grow closer as mother and daughter but that‚Äôs it? That outcome just feels unfinished to me. 

2. The entire time I‚Äôm watching the movie I can‚Äôt help but think of how expensive it was to make this movie and how much this movie will end up making. This is money that could‚Äôve gone to things like real feminism activism and advocating for women‚Äôs rights in the recent overturning of the Roe v. Wade case. That‚Äôs bigger than a movie about a doll we played with growing up and that‚Äôs bigger than the whole message of the movie which promotes some type of surface-level feminism. The hype of the movie has felt like a distraction from the more important things in our very real world: the lack of basic women rights. The ultimate message of the movie feels like it‚Äôs trying to say ‚Äúif a doll wants to be real and human, then maybe we should stop comparing our personal and societal beauty standards to a doll.‚Äù That message is a moot point when women have bigger things to worry about. Accepting ourselves and women power is not a priority when we don‚Äôt even have the rights we used to have a year ago. The real message here to me is that our entertainment industry trumps the attention of real women‚Äôs rights being taken away, sadly.

"What was the message exactly? The barbies went back to having a matriarchy and called it a win with no self reflection that it was just as bad as what the Kens tried to do, laughing it off and giving them a few token positions. The mom went on a fair enough rant about the pressures on women from patriarchy but it was never acknowledged that it puts pressures on Kens too (trans men I've talked with have told me the set of societal expectations they encountered is a /different/ kind of pressure but still a significant one). The Kens didn't even have homes to live in, and all they got was ""you need to find your own identities"" and a pat on the back. The writers could have done something with Allen feeling alienated by the expectation of masculinity but he was just laughed off and not allowed to leave (feminine men are still acceptable punching bags right?). The only positive part was the realistic expectations barbie toy at the end. The movie sets back feminism if anything with its tired tropes of treating men like bumbling slapstick and presenting some kind of inverted power structure as a goal instead of having the courage to imagine anything that's better for everyone.",2023-07-23

"It played on a lot of gender stereotypes on purpose. The men being into big trucks, horses, the Godfather, playing guitar ""at"" them (did you listen to those lyrics? The song was a hilarious spoof on ""romantic"" songs), etc. The line at the end, when Kens asked for more power, was - paraphrasing - ""The Barbies decided to give Kens all the power women had in the real world."" That's why the ""power"" they got was limited and seemed tokenistic at best - it's a reflection on how lots of women feel in the real world. 

As for the relationship between Ken and Barbie, I saw it as a typical ""friendzone"" kind of thing. Barbie never showed any romantic interest in Ken, but he had this idea in his head that his purpose was to be her boyfriend and didn't know what to do with himself when it became clear that he wouldn't get what he wanted. His song also played on the stereotype of the ""nice guy"" who gets ""friendzoned"" and thinks he deserves something just because he's nice - *all my life I've been polite, but I'll sleep alone tonight* - but doesn't bring much to the table - *I'm so great at doing stuff* 

All in all, I think the message of the movie was a bit convoluted, and at some point, I think Greta tried to say too much and ended up saying too little. I don't know where the idea that this movie is some sort of paragon of feminism and whatnot came from, but I think it's being held at too high a standard. It's supposed to be colourful, joyful, silly, and entertaining, with some serious moments thrown in there for good measure.

The film brought the kens from having nothing and living only for barbies to have a necessity to mature an indipendent sense of self and worth but that is not enough. If the kens want to be represented and have power they have to actually work for it, the barbie will not simply land them equal rapresentation because they saw their errors and asked nicely this time. That's not how the real word works and barbieland is a mirror of that, that's why it leaves you with a bitter taste.

The movie says very explicitly that patriarchy is very bad for men too, and when Barbie is talking to Ken at the end, she is basically encouraging him to find his new identity into a contemporary era, outside of the binary gender norms.

Because it turns gender norms on its head. Fat ass man in swimming trunks, no one bats an eye, average day.  
Fat woman in a swimsuit? Stares. Ugly. Why on Earth. (as in this shouldn't be the case, but it's viewed like that). Not to mention how women are as a result more obsessed with how they look and present than men, typically.  


In Barbieland, this burden falls on the Kens. THEY have to fit into the perfect ideal of a man for the Barbies and that is if a Barbie even cares to look at them. And making a Barbie think they look handsome and acknowledge them, is made to seem their entire day's goal.

"I think it‚Äôs a little too simplistic to say Ken represented women and Barbie represented the patriarchy. Ken discovering patriarchy seemed like a red pill analogy. Here‚Äôs this guy that has built his identity around being attractive to women, and he‚Äôs feeling very rejected and undervalued, so he gets radicalized and swings in the other direction, begins undervaluing women and projecting his hurt onto other people.

Barbie took accountability for how she hurt Ken and apologized to him, but ultimately he also had to accept that she didn‚Äôt have romantic feelings for him.

The ending being a matriarchal society still is a joke about the real world. Sure, a lot of people will say women are equals now and should be treated as such, but the actual change that should come along with that never happened overnight and is still a work in progress. When women first started getting jobs, nobody was like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a seat in congress‚Äù. The movie isn‚Äôt saying that slow change for the kens is the way it‚Äôs supposed to be, it‚Äôs just reflecting how society actually baby steps towards equality instead of fully embracing it.",2023-07-26
"I think this movie could've been really smart but just missed it by laying it on too thick with the tirade by the mom about how difficult it is to be a woman and a couple of other scenes.

Apart from that, it points out exactly what you are focussing on in your comment. Girls and women coming out of this movie cheering on the matriarchy in Barbieland tell on themselves. They basically say ""if we were men, we would want patriarchy too"".

The point that seems to be lost on most viewers isn't a subtle one, but it's apparently easy to disregard: While nearly everybody describes Barbieland and ""the real world"" (in the movie) as two perfect opposites in terms of gender domination, it clearly isn't. Compared to our actual reality, the patriarchy is portrayed much more extreme in ""the real world"" of the movie, but it still isn't even close to the total inequality in Barbieland.

When this total inequality is being broken up in the end, it happens in baby steps and Kens are supposed to be happy that they get any rights at all. This resembles many steps of the women's rights movement of the 20th century, in which the injustice of inequalities was recognized by the male-dominated society, but advancements were slowed down due to a prejudicial underestimation of what women are capable of. In the movie, Barbies recognize that Kens have had no rights, no jobs and not even houses, but since they never had the option to prove themselves, they are also look upon as not intelligent enough to do important work.

When the Barbie-President shuts down the Supreme Court seat for Ken, the voice-over says:
""Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. And, one day, the Kens will have as much power and influence in Barbieland, as women have in the real world.""

In that scene, the screen shows the all-male C-suite of in-movie Mattel, so there is some sarcasm to the statement, but it also points towards a still existing discrepancy between the inequalities in Barbieland and ""the real world"". I interpret the message as directed at men, saying something like: ""Look at this alternative reality, where men were/are the oppressed gender. If you lived there, how would you feel about being told that inequality is real and it will be fixed, but not just now and maybe not too quickly and perhaps, sometime in the future, you will be somewhat equal, but not really.""

I'm a man and, as I hinted to above, the movie was a bit too preachy for my taste, but I think both men, who vilify it as some woke radical feminist propaganda, and women, who hail a K/men-oppressing matriarchy as a utopia, are both missing the point and are presenting themselves as insecure and unreflected partisans.",2023-07-26

The only part that bothered me a lot was the car chase scene that was blatantly obviously just a Chevrolet commercial for that stupid blue chevrolet they kept hamfisting into every scene. I know they do these car advertisement things in a lot of movies, Marvel does it pretty often, but it felt particularly egregious and distracting in this movie for some reason.

"While the explicit plan of the Barbies is to turn Kens against eachother, the end result is breaking down their self-identification through their relation with the Barbies. At the start of the film, they identify as being objects to the barbies. At the height of the patriarchal revolt, they identify as being the rulers of barbies. They enter in conflict as two camps both fighting to be the ones continuing to rule the barbies, but they resolve the conflict by breaking their need to identify in relation to the barbies at all. The fact that the explicitly stated aim of the Barbie's plan is not the actual result of their plan is not a dissonance, it's just a reflection of how neither side could imagine the Kens having any other type of self-identity before it happens.

This then leads directly into Ken, on behalf of all other Kens, expressing despair at the notion that self-identification as Ken not being enough, since the world dictates the natural order is ""Barbie and Ken"", only to then realize no, the natural \[i.e. Mattel-dictated\] order is wrong, and it is enough to be Ken, he is, as the Sweater so well puts it, kenough.",2023-07-31

"I just saw the movie, and I know some of my friends are already calling it the worst movie ever and man-hating. I watched it with my boyfriend and none of us saw it as man-hating.

I also felt seen when watching this movie and I think it has done exactly what it set out to do. But I understand why it's not every ones cup of tea, but some people really seem to get really negative about this movie so, just yeah I get where you're coming from for not looking forward to those conversations:D I'm still trying to formulate how I felt about this movie.

I mean you might be right but how could you know that for sure? It seems like everyone who signed off on the script was onboard with the messaging.  

&#x200B;

I think the confusion for me and maybe a lot of people is there‚Äôs multiple themes mixing around in here. Femininity, masculinity, equality, capitalism and consumerism, parent-child relationships, to name a few. All of these are heavy topics on their own and they are trying to do this in a movie based on a kid‚Äôs toy that‚Äôs supposed to be light and funny. So they touch on all these themes (some pretty well, some not so much) but they still have to tie a pretty bow at the end which they did I guess but it conflicts with the rest of the film‚Äòs many messages.",2023-12-26

And Mattel will still profit off his self-realization, if you can even call it that.  As you can see by his sweater ""I'm Kenough"" -- he's still a product.  

Barbie doesn't need a final dance number, because she's on the verge of acquiring humanity.  And no one becomes human through choreographed dance.

It's missing something, I agree.  I think that's part of the film though.  It's not meant to leave you happy or empowered, it's transitioning you back to the real world.  The real world is gynecology appointments, and all the messy stuff that comes with it.",2023-07-22

The people liking and not liking Barbie seem to be falling into a few categories, feminist women who love the message love it most of all, men who felt the movie was anti men hate it most of all, then people who thought the movie was funny and the songs were good like it, and people who didn‚Äôt fall out their seats laughing at the final ‚Äúmuh vagina‚Äù joke didn‚Äôt like it as much.",2023-08-01

"I completely disagree and I mostly didn't like the movie because of how men hating it was. As a woman I grew up seeing Ken and Barbie as a loving couple and never thought of Ken as some accessory but a true gentleman and her equal. She did not live alone. This movie completely erased that and make it all about ""girl power"". Why does ""girl power"" feel as sexist as what men have been doing to us? Why does one group have be feel superior. To me Barbie was always about being proud of your femininity, dreaming of big things and finding love that is forever. Sad how modern feminism won't allow us to love anyone other than ourselves and other women unless of course we find a weak man that will follow us like a puppy and has no opinions or desires of his own - like Alan in this movie.",2023-07-22

"I feel like the point of America Ferrera's character is that she isn't actually weird and dark-- she's just normal like everyone else is. Sometimes people get stressed out and are unsure about themselves, but society forces people to pretend like everything is perfect all the time. 

She mirrors Barbie who previously did have this perfect life without issues and is now being judged by everyone else for not sticking to the status quo. In the end both characters reach this happy medium where they can be ok with who they are even though life isn't perfect.",2023-07-25
"I felt similarly! I was so excited for it as a huge fan of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (less so Greta Gerwig). The plot was scattered and unfocused. The Mattel company plotline was unnecessary and diluted the last third of the movie. 

We got to see way more of the character development of Ken than Barbie. That was weird. Barbie choosing to be human would have been so much more impactful if she had given the speech, reflecting on her recent revelations and changing wants. 

The mother-daughter duo was a lot of wasted time, too. It felt like the writers/director wanted to do so much more than they could squeeze into the run time. I wept so hard when it was revealed the mom was the one playing with the Barbie. I could completely relate to her abject loss of identity and missing the things that use to make her happy. That was so much more powerful than her speech! They could have delved more into that intersection and tied it into Barbie's existential crisis. It was also weird not to go more into why the mom felt so horribly. That's an intense alluding without ever circling back to it. 

It was a beautiful movie though. I adored the sets, the outfits, the little Barbie nods, Margot Robbie (enough said), the dance numbers, and the music. Wish the titular character had gotten more love in her character arc.",2023-08-03

I gotta say America Ferrera's rant about how hard it is to be a woman is weird. Being a human is difficult. Everyone has expectations on them. Everyone is treated poorly sometimes. Everyone has anxiety about the different roles they inhabit during their lives. The implication that men don't struggle at all with the very same things she's talking about seems short-sighted.

The thing that made it incoherent is Gerwig makes Kens both the avatar for women in the real world but also the representation of patriarchal men - she needed to pick one and stick to it.

For the movie to actually contrast with the real world you would have had to have made the Barbies more obviously villains at the start like the real world men. As it is it just kind of comes off as man bashing no matter the situation the men are in.",2023-07-21

I mean Barbie gives up being an ever enduring image of feminine perfection in favour of becoming a complicated messy human. To become a woman that wears a flattering top and wants to get through the day feeling kind of ok about her self. A chance to define herself, make her own meaning. 

I think Ken coming back with ‚Äòpatriarchy‚Äô offered a similar sort of reprieve to the rest of the Barbies only with out the chance to define themselves. But still an opportunity not live up the expectations of being Barbie everyday. 

It‚Äôs not that they wanted to submit to the Kens, they just wanted a break from living up to the pressure of Barbies own standards?",2023-07-23

Barbie land is considered bliss but it‚Äôs a matriarchy so Barbie never realized how bad it was ‚Äî only Ken did. Ken decides to take the birkenstock pill by going with Barbie and then is enlightened that he doesn‚Äôt have to accept the matriarchy and can actively work against it.

The joke is that the scene *looks* like it's leading up to a first job interview, which has been used as the final scene in many other works where the ending revolves around someone/something becoming a normal adult person and joining society.

1. Individualism is important. People shouldn't be limited based on their gender.
2. Patriarchy and Matriarchy are both bad in the long term since one gender ends up oppressed. Gender equality should be achieved.

Now, it succeeded at the first one but the second is trickier since you can't dismantle the Patriarchy in the real world or the Matriarchy in the Barbie World in a single day.

The Kens starting to aspire to have jobs and a voice in the Barbieverse at the end of the film is the equivalent of the Suffragette Movement.

"The movie also goes out of its way to show you how self-aware it is. 

So consider that the movie is being deliberate in every way imaginable. It's also meant to be an exaggeration of reality, even in the real world part of the film.

Why is every single man nothing more than a small collection of a glaring flaw in their character? Why are all of the men ostensibly unaware of their wildly obvious flaws?

I don't know, but my thoughts on this are that this fits into the film's themes revolving around *perception* vs *experience,* and this pattern (i.e., all men are exaggerated character flaws) tries to encompass both of those. 

The *perception* aspect being the way men tend be perceived by women. Tons of unearned confidence, no concept of the world beyond the tip of their nose, blissfully unaware of obvious flaws...is it accurate? No, but that's the point. It's exaggerating the reality because if it just showed what it looks like, we'd only see our own reality.

As far as *experience* goes, I think the experience of being *perceived* by others as nothing more than the worst part of yourself is being portrayed, and then flipped to ask why we consider that a feminine trait in the first place?",2023-07-21

"> Strong contrast between Barbie world and real world but there isn't

I don't understand how they couldn't have been more contrasted. You go from a pink wonderland to a black and grey looking dungeon city where color has been drained and men rule it. The entire contrast is the lack of women Barbie encounters in her first experience in the real world. She literally addresses the contrast? It gets resolved by her daughter telling her she likes her ideas and doesn't hate her job bc I'm sure the whole time she hated her mom worked for such a company but now she realizes she doesn't need to hate that company. 

The teenage girl doesn't like her mom bc she's an edgy teenage girl. The mom is thinking about death bc as she gets older she is faced with death more and what it would be like to leave her daughter behind. 

This movie isn't about ""feminism,"" it's about the woman experience and highlighting that and sometimes feminism is a part of that and sometimes you don't need buzzwords like ""feminism"" to get important points across 

Kens entire existence is to be pathetic and annoying. That is the point of his character, to realize he doesn't and shouldn't be seen as pathetic. The entire ending of the movie matches ""feminism"" when they realize Barbie can still respect Ken instead of lead him on and treat him like shit and he doesn't need to create a patriarchy to do so. 

I just think a few concepts / important points were missed in your reflection. Imo Barbie world couldn't have been more fun and satirical but it also needs to be serious because it lays the foundation for the entire message of the movie. Why would it be about equality? Barbie isn't fighting for social Justice in the real world, she just wants to be a real woman and have that experience which *comes* with the downsides (inequality).",2023-07-22

Every man (and Ken) in this movie is presented as a moron or a moron and a villain - even America Ferraras husband for some random reason. Mens interests are mocked. I‚Äôm sure this plays well in feminist circles but whatever good message Gerwig may have been trying to send (if any) it‚Äôs lost beneath her obvious bitterness toward men which comes out in this movie.

I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out if we are supposed to care about Ken because ~*~men‚Äôs issues~*~ or if Ken is simply a metaphor for women in the Real World.

At any rate, Ryan Gosling did a great job with the character they gave him, but, to me, it‚Äôs unfortunate that in a movie about feminism, the male is the one that ‚Äústole the show.‚Äù Don‚Äôt know if that was on purpose or speaks to the problem at hand. I do not know what is real/meta. Many folks say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think too much‚Äù but it‚Äôs hard not to think when such important themes are at hand, and I haaaaate it when movie-makers go into a movie with the assumption that audiences are stupid, which is exactly how this movie felt while watching it.",2023-07-25
"My take on the song (which could be totally wrong) after doing a rewatch is that it starts off as the later (male power / frustration) and then ends with a sort of realisation from him. It starts off about how he‚Äôs so polite but will sleep alone tonight, but the chorus changes at the end from the original I‚Äôm just Ken ‚Äúwhere I see love she sees a friend, what‚Äôll it take?‚Äù etc to the final chorus of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enough, I‚Äôm great at doing stuff‚Äù and then rather than I‚Äôm just ken, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Name‚Äôs Ken (and so am I) put that manly hand in mine‚Äù. So almost like a ‚Äúsisterhood‚Äù moment with the other Kens which is backed up in the choreography, and I read that as less about a statement of male power and more about them having self worth but feeling crushed by the system? 

Where that might not completely add up is that we jump back to the film where he‚Äôs still in a bit of a crisis about Barbie and how he‚Äôs nothing without her. So I could be wrong. It‚Äôs a little muddled and I felt like I REALLY needed that rewatch to understand it all a bit better because it tries to do a lot of things and say a lot, so the first time I watched it I was kinda overwhelmed.

With a dash of ""rainbow capitalism"" (do we call it ""pink capitalism"" when it's about feminism instead of queer rights?) bc when he finally listens to a woman (America F.) he tells her the idea is stupid until he finds out it will make a lot of money.

It did. That's the joke at the end. The Kens aren't allowed immediate equal positions of power (as they should in a perfect world), but they are allowed lower positions that aren't really powerful and being told to ""*work their way up*"". Of course this means the system is against them because when they gained their rights, it was the Barbies in all the powerful positions. System's biased against the Kens and that's **bad**.  


And that's supposed to be shown as bad. Because that reflects the modern world.  


Where giving women the least bit of power in the world is treated as something huge even thought it doesn't change that the system is rigged against them.

">The whole issue with dolls and little girls playing with dolls and how that relates to the patriarchy is that the little girls are not stimulating those complex parts of their brains. So even if you play with engineer barbie, you're still just playing dolls. You're not actively thinking through spatial patterns or building things with your hands that will later help you advance in science and math fields.

Not everything is about science and math. When people play with dolls they create imaginary stories which involves creativity and human interaction. They use their imagination the way writers do to create different plots for the dolls. That is just as important as learning how to add and subtract numbers and playing with a chemistry set.",2023-07-24

">I feel like if this were made in the 90's the movie would've ended with the Barbies realizing they had a share of the blame and instead strove to once again be something the modern world can aspire to.

Barbieland in-universe was created by Mattel.

The Barbies are **not** consciously oppressing the Kens, they're programmed to do so by Mattel. How are the Barbies to blame?

Mattel is the one who designed this society and gave everyone their roles to play. 

It's best to think of the Barbieland entities as androids with AI programming. Margot Barbie is the first one to ""glitch"" and refuse her programming.",2023-07-21

"As someone who loved it, I interpreted it a lot differently. All of the Barbies in Barbieland do exist IRL. There are a few plus-sized Barbies, Barbie in a variety of races, Barbie who uses a wheelchair, pregnant Barbie. All exist IRL. That hasn't prevented most people from thinking of Barbie as ""stereotypical Barbie."" 

A big thesis of the movie, the marketing proposition that made Mattel bite, is that being a woman in a patriarchal society is a contradiction and so is Barbie. Barbie is every woman (it's all in her /s). 

Barbie is feminist and Barbie is kind of bad for women. Barbie was founded by women but is currently run by a man. Barbies come in all shapes but Barbie has also contributed to unfair beauty standards. 

The point is: it's difficult for women to be themselves in a society with so many contradicting expectations of them and there isn't a simple solution. It isn't boys vs girls because mistreating men isn't the answer. There isn't one. I think I would have liked the movie less if Greta tried to solve sexism. It felt more true that it ended without a satisfactory fix.

">  I don't think they communicated that Ken was an incel for Barbie til later in the movie 

I think it's more supposed to be that Ken can't conceive of himself except in relation to Barbie. He has no identity of his own. This is meant to parallel the way women have been perceived IRL as accessories for men rather than their own selves.

>""The icing on this shitty cake is when the Barbies humorously tell the Kens they can't be in the Supreme Court, and will have to start at the lower courts. WTF? This excuse-- oh sure, we can be equal, but you need to start on the bottom rung-- is used on women IRL and it fucking blows.""

Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the point? The point isn't that barbieland is some kind of perfect society. The point is that barbieland, though they considered themselves progressive and equal, was no better than the real world. 

> When America Ferreira suggests the idea of a regular Barbie to help with womens' self esteem issues, it's written off as not being lucrative.

Well, the COE says that, then the COO (or whoever) says it will be profitable and he turns on a dime (heh) and accepts the idea. But as with all self-criticism from major corporations, you never can really jive with it because at the end of the day even if they admit they are soulless monsters, they're still soulless monsters. It always lands a liiiiittle flat since of course mattel put the OK on that message in the first place. 

To your last point, basically I see Barbieland as a construct created by Ruth and perpetuated by Mattel, and after years of faux progressive corporatism, barbieland is a place that is like a reflection of our world, since in that world barbie got all the important jobs and personhood and ken got nothing. So just like America Ferrera's character has to find a way to cope with being a woman in the real world, eventually Ken finds a way to cope with being a Ken in Barbieland. Both societies are unjust. Both are (kind of) working on it, but both are also wayyyyy too quick to pat themselves on the back and declare the job done and everything perfect.",2023-07-23

Stop trying to over analyze and politicize everything and just laugh and enjoy it.

I think the problem is that they played with a really thin line while trying to make it a ""satire"". I don't feel the ""satire"" was portrayed properly, because the movie left multiple interpretations for the spectator. They had to define more clearly their purpose, and they didn't and here is the problem.

I honestly think that if they defined it more as a satire it would have been better (for me, at least) because the moments where they talked about those ""political"" topics could feel kinda uncomfortable, or simply weird. And it's almost the whole plot where they talk about it lmao",2023-07-24

I do wonder if his character was originally meant to have a much more antagonistic role but there were limits to how evil Mattel would let Gerwig portray the company. I wasn't even sure what the CEO's motivation was in the final film, especially once he went into Barbieland, it feels like there were bigger plans for him that were dropped. I could definitely see an alternative version of the film where the Mattel CEO takes advantage of Ken's naivety to feed him some Andrew Tate style bullshit (with the motivation being that Ken's dojo casa house was outselling Barbie), which leads to the Kens taking over as they do in the final release.",2023-07-24

"The resolution of Ken's story was intended to be unsatisfying. It's important to remember that the Kens, serving as little more than accessories for Barbie, and lacking in property, jobs, education, voting rights, and representation in positions of power, symbolize the way women have been treated throughout the vast majority of human history.

The ending mirrors the exceedingly slow progress men have made throughout history in empowering women. The dissatisfaction you feel was intentionally cultivated by the filmmakers. Their aim was to encourage viewers to draw a parallel between the matriarchal society of Barbieland and our own patriarchal world, and to redirect this dissatisfaction towards our own gradual progress with gender equality.",2023-07-26
Did Ken not get a resolution though? He was now able to explore himself after coming to a revelation that he is ‚Äúken‚Äù not Barbie and ken.

">Women get generally paid lower and are usually not in positions of power compared to men.

Absolutely.  It's going to take a long time to change because men are in charge and they think things like this:- Women don't need to be paid as much because they have a man who is already getting paid enough for the both of them.

\- Women's pay is for extras like shoes & haircuts.  Men's pay is for the house, car & food on the table.

\- Men get upset and feel bad about themselves when their boss is a woman.  Women don't get upset when their boss is a man.

\- If we recognize her success, it'll make the men feel bad because they weren't able to do what she could.- She's not really in the Dev org because she doesn't write code.  Me? I don't write code either, but that's different because I'm a manager.

How do I, as a woman, know all this?  I have been in management for many, many years and different male managers were comfortable enough to tell me this stuff.

My daughter thought there was enough equality in the world.  And then she went to college. She saw that the women professors understood her work a lot better than the male professors did.  One of the women professors liked her work so much that she asked her to do an independent study project, which is prestigious and can lead to graduate work.  But then it turns out that UCLA recently changed their rules so that only tenured professors can oversee an independent study.  Most tenured professors are men.  The women professors that my daughter had a rapport with did not have tenure.  After my daughter lost out on her first shot at a prestigious project, she started understanding how the rules are quietly tilted to favor men.",2023-07-23

"I think the movie was just trying to juggle a lot of things at once. There were a lot of potential plot points thrown into the film that were sort of just acknowledged at surface level and then never explored further.

I did think that wait, the barbies only experienced patriarchy for a day, why did they resonate so much with her speech? I figure that the small pox analogy works in the sense that no one in Barbieland really understands the concept of oppression until the mother and daughter explain the real world to them. The same way that Ken suddenly has an epiphany that he doesn't like being abused by Barbie only when he visits the real world, the barbies have the same realization once the roles were switched. Also it doesn't seem like the barbies have a real concept of time, so perhaps them only experiencing something for a day or longer is irrelevant.

To your point about linking patriarchy to into mortality, I feel they do return to that theme when Barbie is talking to the creator at the end.  She says something like 'we use words like patriarchy and barbie to make sense of the world', and I felt they wrapped that point up up pretty nicely there. Although they didn't explore the actual theme of death.

&#x200B;

I feel Ryan Gosling's Ken had a perfect ending. He needs to find happiness in his own identity, and showing anything more for him kind of detracts from the point of his character at this stage. His identity isn't defined by his love of barbie or horses, or being a leader. He just has to find satisfaction in simply being himself. And I think that's a healthy conclusion for him.",2023-08-06

The other thing is you may have a point IF the Barbie land matriarchy in which Kens live was portrayed negatively but it isn‚Äôt. The real world patriarchy is negative and the Ken patriarchy is negative - which is weird mixed messaging if Kens are the equivalent of women in Barbie land.

The rift that caused Barbie to have these thoughts had ripple effects. Ken getting into the patriarchy because it suddenly made his existence as magical as Barbie‚Äôs made a lot of sense.  I don‚Äôt think they need to go further into how the Barbie‚Äôs became brainwashed because they had never encountered outside ideas before, so they would be easy targets for newfound philosophies having never dealt with complex thoughts before. 

Barbie needed to apologize because Ken had probably held longtime deep feelings of being incomplete, being an accessory to someone who doesn‚Äôt love him romantically.

Also side note I hated when they un-brainwashed that one Barbie and she said ‚ÄúI would never wear this!‚Äù And the mom goes ‚ÄúOf course you wouldn‚Äôt you‚Äôre a physicist.‚Äù Like uhh okay I understand if you said it‚Äôs because she was brainwashed but because she‚Äôs smart she wouldn‚Äôt dress in revealing clothing?

I liked some of the themes but it felt like it put women down (weird Barbie and just liking her at the end because she helped them is a worn out trope) and was preachy as well as just making a joke out of men so they could get twitter users to really like it.

">and Finally, the ending... you expect everything to get resolved, but it doesn't. The male CEO of MATTEL continues to make money off of women and also contributes to capitalism by making an ""Ordinary Barbie"". The patriarchy in the real world was not affected/changed whatsoever. 

Late to this thread but would it not be incredibly insincere for these issues to be magically resolved when they are still ongoing? And the Mattel thing is probably as far as they could push that criticism without losing their licence. 

Totally take your point re: the mother/daughter relationship though, felt like it never went anywhere meaningful. 

>Now I understand that all the Barbies were like.... brainwashed or something? But they didn't even explain that well and made it seem like women LIKED being part of the patriarchy unless someone snapped them out from it. That's untrue. No women likes the patriarchy and we're perfectly aware that it's happening.

I think this is probably the biggest issue with the film (or at least its most distracting plot point). To the point where I feel like I must be missing some subtext - if anyone can explain I'd appreciate it. How would Ken persuade a community that doesn't take him seriously into a completely new worldview? The fact that he successfully brainwashed anyone just infantilised the Barbies and suggests that they never had any power or agency to begin with. But then the entire movie relies on the idea that they do. What gives?",2023-07-23
"Agree with this writeup 100% 

I think at its root, this movie is actually supposed to be a brain off movie, its a dumb summer commedy that doesn't have much to say about anything. And thats fine! Its good even for someone to want a movie like that to have a message. I laughed at this movie, it was fun to laugh.

But, unfortunately, this is also an anti-patriarch film. Its very very overt about this, its the main conflict, its the primary motivation for the villain, its the inciting action of the film even... and holy shit it just butchers the attempt it makes at a message. They shouldn't have done both, it cant be a brain off dumb comedy AND a feminist critique of society. It doesn't work. Why the film even brings up critiques of capitalism when its the mess it is with everything else escapes me, to seem cool? Seems like it worked, general audiences seem to think it was a power move against mattel to make this movie, fuck me people in this thread are convinced of that on comments with thousands of points.

I wish I could have also brain off watched this movie but just could not. Thinking about the movie after the fact and I'm mostly sickened that its pushing a pro-mattel narrative on the back of feminism and they seem to have gotten away with that scott free. I'm expecting a product line of ""relatable"" Barbies (real woman barbie, depression barbie, etc.) to be sold to adults for $60/doll in the coming months.",2023-07-22
"I disagree with all of this. I'm going through me second bell hooks book right now, All About Love, and to me it seemed like Greta Gerwig was VERY well informed about radical feminism. The handling of the Kens - that's straight up out of bell hooks book or some Transformative Justice talk. Men are also victims of the patriarchy, and Barbie helped Ken realize it. She began to understand her true value and set him on the path to discover his.

The movie is not only about wanting to be seen and acknowledged, it also pushes against the idea that the world can be neatly fixed. So many young ""radical"" people, activists, etc., work so hard for a year or two and then get burned out and quit altogether when really, they'd probably be more impactful if the pursued less ""shiny"" endeavors and did what they could to finish the marathon instead of trying to sprint. 

The world wasn't perfect at the end, because in real life it never will be. But all the characters moved closer to self-actualization. Shit, I just read a Pema Ch√∂dron passage about bodhichitta being the opposite of a path toward answers and more about being comfortable with uncertainty - along the lines of what Ruth was telling Barbie.

Idk, this was the funniest movie I've seen in a while. It's also one of the few big blockbuster movies I've seen wear it's radical feminist themes on it's sleeve, and handle those themes with the nuance deserved.",2023-07-22
"About why Barbie wanted to become human: I feel there was a lot missing. A real heart to heart with the mother and daughter duo where she not only remembers her visions of them playing with her but yearns for it. Not as a toy, but a human. Having a childhood, going to school, growing up and figuring out who she is, for example. Realising she missed out on that but that, if she leaves Barbieland, she can still figure out who she is and grow old in a bittersweet happiness instead of the forever perfect plastic world. Then the moment Barbie chooses to become human would feel more deserved. Instead the only thing we got was that short scene where she tells that old woman she is beautifull and a telepathic movie maker montage from Ruth at the end to kind of hint that she wants that.

Honestly it was Ken who had more reasons to stay in the real world. After all it took him less than a day to realise he was more welcome there than in Barbieland.",2023-07-27

Take Sound of Freedom. Critics who pointed out the flaws of the movie have been attacked as being either anti-American or pro-sex trafficking.

It's a scary, exciting, and very vulnerable experience (literally having a stranger poke all up in and around you) that marks a transition into adulthood. 

I think the reason why things weren't magically fixed in terms of gender equality is because the whole point of the movie is that gender equality is huge and complex issue.

They're not in submission to the Barbies.

The message was that the Kens just need to find their own identities and not rely on traditional masculinity stereotypes which is harmful.

Kens start out as accessories that are afterthoughts to Barbies and that starting point just doesn't make sense for any substantial appraisal of real world masculinity or femininity.

It might work for the final of a children film that has to clearly show the moral in the end but it would not fit here. Also I disagree with this idea I see in many comments that the Barbies in this film are shown to have learned the lesson and generally be better than Kens/mens etc. They didn't have this journey, the simply lost Barbieland to the Kens and the take it back and they aren't shown as much more awear than the start. The Barbies as a group don't have this arc, that is Margot Barbie arc, in fact she is the one that make the ""not sure this is good"" a bit bitter face when she hears this.
Barbieland at the star of the movie is a mirror of the real world and at the end it still is. Barbie, Gloria and her daughter (and a bit Ken too) are the only ones that were changed by the experience, they are the only not strereotipical people/doll in there.",2023-07-30

Impressive. That says more about you than you think. I'm not a women, I went with my wife, all her friends adore the film, I've not actually met anyone IRL that didn't like it. One of the guys in our audience was a big bald guy that couldn't stop laughing the whole time, it was a ride.

I mean, cinema is an opinion, but critics love it, audience clearly loves it, you are the minority here, and it might be worth exploring why.

I get the other commentators, they're mad about irrelevant conservative political points, but you've got something else, you've managed to find, probably the only women that would have walked out of a Barbie movie of all things.

"Yeah I agree with you for the most part. It could have remained a feminist commentary without blatantly telling you it was a feminist commentary with every step. Some of the on the nose stuff was funny, but there were parts of it that straight up ruined scenes for me. 

There was a line from the narrator at the end that had me literally like ""how on earth did that get left in there!?"" because of how much it brought the mood down. It was where the Kens are asking if they can be part of the President's cabinet and she's like ""no but you can have a more minor role to start"" or something like that and the Kens get all excited, and then the narrator goes ""that would give them about as much power as a woman in the real world""....... like that line left me SO disappointed in the moment. Like it was not only overkill by that point, but it just made me sad that they couldn't have just let it be a harmonious moment where progress is made without reminding everyone of the fact that women aren't treated as equals for the 100th time in the span of 2 hours. It was just shocking to me that they felt it made the scene better at the point in the movie where feelings of resolution are okay and appropriate. Like the world isn't perfect and we all know that. Women aren't always treated equally and we know that. It was just such an irritating miss.

There were elements of the movie that I totally enjoyed and thought were spot on and I would like to watch it again when it's released on streaming services, but right now I think it's a movie that I appreciated more than a movie I totally loved.",2023-07-26

I wish the end where Barbie sees all the women and life and trees also showed suffering.  Attending funerals, being fired, getting into a a car accident, fighting with your loved ones, being heartbroken. But it only showed the beauty in the world and I just don‚Äôt think it was giving what it needed to give. 

Gosling was absolutely favorite part of the movie. There was one part when Barbie comes back to town and he‚Äôs a douchebag and they fight. He says something hurtful to her (I don‚Äôt remember what exactly) and he is so upset that he is intentionally hurting her. It really broke my heart.

I think maybe they could have taken Barbie‚Äôs story in a different direction maybe focus more on finding her purpose in life and helping Gloria doing the same thing. Gloria was suffering and felt hopeless. Would have been nice to see that addressed in a different way other than defeating the patriarchy? Lol 

The whole things feels like a vicious cycle. The Barbie‚Äôs think they changed all of womankind by having jobs and shit. Now they think they have solved all the problems by defeating the Ken Patriarchy. Did they actually do anything? I dunno.

The second section was about Gloria's daughter Sasha and how she rightfully calls out Barbie for creating issues such as body image. Barbie was originally a tall, white, skinny, perfectly mobile woman with no health issues, so she didn't portray most women. Now the Barbie bran incorporates different skin colours, body shapes, mobility and health issues. However, Barbie nor the movie actually addresses this issue. I think it's great to see so much diversity in the dolls and the movies but the diversity can't be acknowledged without realising that it didn't always used to be this way. Multiple movements have pushed for Barbie to become diverse, she wasn't originally created like that, which is what makes it such an important moment in time for women everywhere.",2023-07-24
"This movie is actually way too complicated for little kids. I think it‚Äôs better to show as pre-teens because of some of the subject matter and because little children don‚Äôt understand concepts like patriarchy.

I actually think Barbie not showing interest in Ken made perfect sense as a woman. We‚Äôve been told by the media since children our biggest accomplishment is to marry someone and then our story ends. By not being interested in Ken ‚Äî a predetermined person for her ‚Äî but wanting a life of her own choosing for herself gave her more agency than most films give women. A lot of Greta Gerwigs films do not end with the girl getting the guy because just like men have stories that don‚Äôt revolve around partnership so do women.

No wait, the grown woman is voicing the hypocrisy of appealing to men's egos. No wait, we're back to Barbie realizing she doesn't need permission to be a person and have flaws.""

Like... the movie is about all of those things, and they're great messages. In retrospect all of the themes connect, but in the moment while watching it I felt like I was getting whiplash from what the narrative was considering to be it's main focus.

The manipulation tactic was SUCH an odd thing to flex too.

You are supposed to feel sympathy for the plight of the Kens and you are supposed to connect that to the plight of women in the real world.  Margot talks to Ken at the end about figuring out who he is independent of Barbie‚Äîthat‚Äôs a nod to women who have had to fight to find a place for themselves in a world that historically has centered men.

"Idunno, I mean, Barbieland being a pink reflection of our real world, it makes sense to end with the dominant sex congratulating themselves for being so benevolent to the lesser sex... it's similar to the CEO character patting himself on the back saying their company is built on women. 

The big relevatory moment America Ferrera's character has isn't transformational, it's like treading water at best. That's what is so bleak about the movie, imo. You have this great epiphany and at best it just helps you cope with the way the world is.

So the Kens in Barbieland will eventually have to have their own version of that, I guess. Or not. But it really felt like the movie was saying there isn't an actual way to solve it, it literally makes you feel hopeless and helpless. 

If the movie ended with a pat 'true equality' ending, it would feel too preachy and saccharine imo. The message isn't ""we can create an equitable society."" It's ""it's possible to survive in this unjust society."" Kind of a downer, lol.",2023-07-23

">Barbie movie of all movies for being too overtly feminist. Realistically even if the movies themes were more ""subtle"" you probably still would have taken issue at a woman's issues being in the spotlight,

I think what personally got to me was that I was *excited* about the feminism aspect but it fell short. The speeches were just. Awfully scripted. The message was cloudy, too. It felt jarringly like a 2013 tumblr post, almost like a parody of itself. Like, the speech would have been groundbreaking two decades ago but today it felt weirdly commercial. 

Very much tell, not show. With all the speeches they couldn't devote time to representing what she was saying in the movie!! No time given to developing the deteriorating mother-daughter relationship that was shown to BE THE CAUSE of the entire plot. No time to show her struggling with her job and being a mother. Or the restricive body standards. Finacial inequality. Balancing being emotional and direct. ALL of these were stated in the speech and ignored the rest of the movie. But they had time for a whole unnecessary plotline with goofy mattel men and a 10 minute ken musical number. 

Instead misogyny was shown as ""girls should wear booby clothes and serve men beer"" as if thats even SLIGHTLY the what the patriarchy is. They could've had the women be encouraged to wear that but then be slutshamed for giving in. They could've had women WANT to be a server and be ashamed of it. 

The solution was presented as ""women just need to realize whats wrong and believe in themselves and everything's solved, misogyny eradicated, yippee!!"" it all felt so hollow - it feels like they solved their cheap version of inequality and we should be grateful for it because at least the ""real world"" isn't as bad - BUT IT'S WORSE!!

It‚Äôs a shame that Gerwig had to show all the barbies as clever and empowered, because if they had of been able to be the butt of the joke more they would be more entertaining. It‚Äôs absurd but it reduces the Barbie character to the most boring character in her own movie, when she should have been the most fun.

It‚Äôs a wasted opportunity not to have the different barbies have radically different personalities instead of all being clever and empowered.

"I viewed this movie from a surrealist point of view. All the Barbies set that tone for me by playing their troupes, like for example why is weird Barbie weird? Well its because of how a kid plays too hard with her. With that being said I then treated the story line like some kid just playing, and even the moment where Stereotypical Barbie gets real and mentions death I recall that as a kid where you are playing with your friends and one of them just slips up and breaks the imaginary world with some real world stress. 

Regardless of what the true intentions of Mattel had for this movie or their dolls, what I picked up from the overall tone of this movie is Mattel saying they see how they messed up but also how a doll cant take on such a massive task like representing women. It was even stated by Gloria about how impossible the standards are even for a doll that is just suppose to symbolize a woman. To go further, Mattel tries to defend itself by explaining the history of dolls and how before the Barbie, dolls were meant to ease you into the roll of motherhood. What Barbie did is give a level of autonomy to these young girls, was it perfect? Of course not, but it was a huge leap from the baby dolls that were given to young girls to teach them how to be a mother. To me it shows a more realistic portrayal of society changes, which is not by leaps and bounds but by micro adjustments, especially if you're not part of the group that makes those decisions. More importantly, we are the ones in charge not Mattel. In fairness, it was also societies fault for imposing these standards companies like Mattel can only succeed if their product sells. Look at all the more realistic Barbies, do you think they would actually be sold to children or whether children would really want them? As a kid I want to fantasize about something amazing because I honestly felt like I was living a pretty bad reality. Mattel is at least honest and portrayed themselves as the villians and as imbeciles as well, but they also portray themselves as the middle men. They are the bridge between the film world and the Barbie world. You can totally view Mattel as being disingenuous but we will have to wait and see, I took the ending as saying that Barbie will adapt with the real world. Throughout the whole movie Mattel was portrayed as stupid, power drunk and just wanting things to stay the same and I believe that what Mattel is telling us here is that they recognize how stupid and out of date it is, much like the baby dolls. They are giving Barbie to us but it also comes with some real consequences as well. 

&#x200B;

In the Barbie world, Ken was the second class citizen. It is a direct observation of how women are treated in the real world. All the ownership and empowerment belong to the Barbies and no one even thought of what the Kens are going through, since they were just meant to be a Barbie companion. I think for men this is a very direct message. The moment that the Kens felt empowered they were able to overthrow the Barbies. It wasn't because masculinity was toxic, but the mere fact that any gender identifying itself based off that characteristic will oppress the other group.  The absurdity of the film falls in line with how absurd gender roles are. What I found interesting too was that the women knew how to gain power back, which was by distracting the Kens with each other while they swoop the government positions. This feels like a direct warning of how men were able to no only get into power but stay. Even after all that, Stereotypical Barbie understood that it wasn't right or at least she felt like something was off and she heard out Ken for the first time and realized that he needs to be empowered as well, but separate from her. A funny scene that was definitely more of a message was when all the Barbies are dividing the roles of government and they give the lesser roles to the Kens. While the Kens were just happy to be part of it by any extent, it really goes to show that they still intend to keep the power, this is our society.

Perhaps we just saw it differently, but I can't help but see this as a letter from Mattel to us. Not just apologizing but also asking us to understand them because they thought they understood us but they were so off. I see this in the relationship with Barbie and the youth. When Sasha called her a fascist and just went off on Barbie without knowing her it was just as bad as Barbie trying to talk to her like she knew her. This disconnect really spoke to me, because we are just asking way too much for any toy to represent us but the role of a toy is important because it does help mold the vision of a child and who they want to be. Mattel may have done well by offering children the vision that they can be anything, but they were dropping the ball by not addressing the hardships and challenges that they may face and I think that is a hard task to take on as well. 

I genuinely enjoyed this movie, from a writing standpoint I think this is absolutely solid. They were playful yet deep with messages. The fact that this had a surrealism tone helped me just focus on what they are trying to say with each scene, and I honestly think they put a lot of thought and care into this film. It felt my toys were apologizing to me for not telling me how hard life really is, but its only because they didn't know how. This is just how I took it all.",2023-07-31
"Already all over this thread you have people saying the Kens were portrayed the way they were because in the toy line Kens didn‚Äôt have jobs and weren‚Äôt in charge etc - and it‚Äôs spin from the movie, in reality when they made Ken it was often with a ‚Äúman‚Äù job to bring out a Barbie with the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù job, so there was President Ken and First Lady Barbie, Pilot Ken and Flight attendant Barbie and Doctor Ken and nurse Barbie - all before there was President Barbie, doctor Barbie or Pilot Barbie.

"Your critiques are valid; its hard to disentangle a movie critiquing Barbie from the fact that it could only exist because Mattel gave it the go-ahead and Mattel's going to make a ton of money on it.    


But given that limitation, I do think Gerwig pushed in a lot of valid criticism of Mattel and that capitalist version of feminism, something I think would have never been allowed 15 years ago or with a less prominent director. And I think it was great to have a real interrogation/critique of the image of womanhood that Barbie puts out there and which is a reflection of the images of womanhood society/media generally puts out there.  It could have been much edgier if it were made without Mattel's approval and using a satirical/not ""authorized"" barbie type stand in.    


But I think it was extremely powerful to have an interrogation of both the idea of barbie and the images of womanhood that media gives us within this context, and I don't trust anyone else to do it as well as Gerwig did.  There were a few missteps, but overall I think it pushed a lot of boundaries in great ways.

Also Mattel points out ‚Äúhey we do things only for money and have mostly men in power‚Äù and that somehow makes it better instead of actually changing things?

"To be fair all the 'dolls' are goofy and a bit dimwitted.  On both sides they are easily brainwashed, except kens have a bit worse, but that is the whole point of the kens.

As a character Ken is just an accessory to Barbie, so he doesn't have his own identity. The arc of the character is for him to learn to forge his own identity in a healthy self-loving way. Which I think is a good, positive message for the type of man he represents.

I thought they did a great job at 'bringing the sexes together' at the end, at least to the point that it makes sense. Barbieland is intentionally meant to be an extreme caricature world of like if women controlled everything and men controlled nothing. And the kens are the oppressed in that society.

I like that the speech from the mom and then Barbie giving one to Ken that he is Ken. And doesn't have to be Barbie and Ken. He doesn't have to live for Barbie.

For me the Gaslighting and manipulation that the Barbie's did triggered a sort of anxiety for me because of how abusive women use mental tactics and men tend to be physical or violent.

It's not about listing the ways the world is unfair, it's about explaining how you can't win men's approval in patriarchy. Whatever you do, you're wrong. So trying to please men and make them happy is a fool's errand.

You can only be effective and regain control of your life if you *don't try to earn men's approval.*

So it really makes sense that this is how they resolve the issue and that it's how women regain power in the story. What it means is that if every women had this in mind, they could block vote against sexist men and vote for laws that protect women. Because we're fifty percent of the population.

>first shown experience as a real woman is... that women have to go to gynecologists? It's a funny shocking joke - but what's the meaning?

Because the expectation is set that her excitement will be about some new career in the real world, as if that will define her. And you're waiting to see what that career is, so we can judge it, and put her in a particular box. By not giving us that, we're reminded that just being herself is enough. She's real, she has all the parts. She doesn't need to be career Barbie to impress us. She just need to be herself.

Edit: Also re:gyno. There's a quote from the filmmaker where she explains that she was always ashamed of her body. So if she could show Barbie smiling and thrilled to go to the gynecologist, then maybe at least some little girls wouldn't see it as something shameful.",2023-08-06

"Well the issue is more that this film isn't particularly nuanced or clever in the delivery of themes it's trying to promote. The writing is quite poor all-around which is a shame given the team behind the script. It's a very surface level take on the issues of patriarchy and women in a male-dominated world propped up by mostly cheap jokes and strange plot vehicles used to push it forward. 

I thought heading into this that it was going to be something like a tongue in cheek dark comedy ala The Favourite or have nuance tackling tough subjects like Promising Young Woman except in a Barbie skin. A blend of the two could have been a very interesting film. Instead it's just kind of a like an overly long YouTube video or SNL sketch grinding jokes into the ground and offering ""empowering"" one-liners here and there. 

It's a convoluted mess by the time the credits roll. It's partially meant to be a journey of self-discovery but Barbie's whole adventure into the real world consists of running across some stereotypical douchebags on the boardwalk, a snotty teenager being a jerk to her, and a strange car chase before headed back. Ken brings back dumb ideas of patriarchy, flips Barbieworld in a day, and then it's fixed the next day with some hollow you're Kenough gag to put a bow on it. It all feels mostly unearned by the end. Ryan Gosling hard carries the film with his performance really giving his all, but everyone else is just kind of going through the motions in a very mediocre plot. 

There isn't really anything that this film does on a high level that makes it stand out or leave a lasting impression which was the expectation heading into a film written by the mind behind Lady Bird and recent Little Women adaptation. We know that both Gerwig and Baumbach are capable of very high level screenplay writing but that just was not the case here at all. Marketing drummed a fervor for this one, but it just felt like a bland mess by the end of it trying to interject themes of empowerment but without any sort of emotional journey or arc to make it land effectively.

I think a lot has been said about the overall portrayal of real world men and Kens as stupid and misguided, so I won't repeat that. But even if you excuse all the portrayal of men as morons who need correcting,  theres  this one main sympathetic good female character Gloria and the way she is written imo shows exactly why this movie is so anti - men.

 In the movie you see her husband for a minute and he‚Äôs learning a language so his daughter mocks him then his wife (the hero human character rolls her eyes at him). Then later she‚Äôs talking about how some old boyfriend (or current affair) taught her to drive wildly - again her husband is this lame figure of mockery. None of this is relevant to the wider commentary on gender or masculinity, it's simply ripping on a lame male character for humour.

I think one excersise to do to find out if something is sexist and bigoted is to reverse the genders and see if it‚Äôs acceptable. Would a male heroic character who mocked his wife learning a language and then laughed about some cooler old girlfriend be seen as a good guy, would that go unnoticed? 
No he‚Äôd seem like an asshole. 

And I know women will say lots of women are treated that way in film like Gloria's husband is. Well no they‚Äôre not, not by the supposedly good guy and the character were supposed to have sympathy for.  There is no Arnold Shwarzanegger movie where he‚Äôs the hero and him and his son are mocking his wife and then he‚Äôs reminiscing about some hot old girlfriend whose wilder than his lame wife. Because that would instantly make him seem like an asshole to both men and women.

And yet - to women like Greta Gerwig or the feminist types who enjoyed this film - it doesn‚Äôt even register as a bad thing when Gloria does it. She's still the righteous woman battling in an unfair system. 
She goes on the hero of the story, her disrespect of her lame husband and the father of her kids just a small joke.  The opposite would absolutely not be accepted by women in reverse and still see them think of a man doing that ad a good guy to root for.

Now I know feminist and some men will come out and say - actually this movie is positive for men because it teaches them patriachy and toxic masculinity is holding them back from expressing their feelings blah blah blah. But really - that‚Äôs just a feminist talking point decided as true by feminist women. Men on the whole aren‚Äôt sitting round wishing they could cry more or whatever, so actually that makes it even worse. Because not only are all men made morons, you have this condescending vision of what is good for men according to feminist women being presented, regardless of what men actually think.

Again, imagine the same movie in reverse - since women claim so many male movies do show women this way. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs starring Stallone - all the women are morons and femininity is on the wrong path and needs to be corrected - Stallone obviously thinks his wife is lame and talks about old girlfriends, yet is the good guy in the movie - oh and there‚Äôs a message delivered by Stallone to a crying woman who loves him, about how actually she needs to find herself and the overall view of how women need to change for their own good according to men is presented during the movie as a theme.

I mean it‚Äôs not only sexist - it‚Äôs downright hateful and totally unempathetic in an unknowing way.",2023-08-01

You seem to have missed the whole point of Ken's arc. At the start he's miserable because he's internalized the expectation that a man's worth is derived from possessing and being desired by women, and he's living in a bubble where no one is focused on him. the conflict comes when he discovers the real world and latches onto the patriarchal notion that the problem is women not being expected to fawn over him, rather than the *idea* that he's worthless if he isn't attached to a doting woman. Patriarchy tells them they're useless because women aren't throwing themselves at them, and they blame the women instead of the toxic societal pressure that's denigrating them.

In the end, the Kens' happy ending isn't going back to the status quo. Their triumph is accepting that they have friendship and passions, talents and hobbies. That they can have worth and respect based on *themselves*, completely independent from romantic relationships with Barbie.",2023-08-06

There's no way you're earnestly making the point that this is on par with the social pressures experienced by women.

""Playing with Ken's feelings"" is not what ""toxic femininity"" is. Toxic femininity describes toxic behaviors that patriarchal societies pressure women into adopting (just like toxic masculinity is that for men). Think being meek, nurturing, playing dumb, being children-obsessed etc. In this sense, the movie does address it with the way Barbies get 'brainwashed' into playing along with patriarchal social norms in Kendom

"I agree with your position about everyone confirming to society‚Äôs expectations of them. Even nowadays many women have to conform to being feminists and working because that‚Äôs expected of them, and wanting to be a stay-at-home mom is backwards or unambitious. Men have plenty of expectations set on them, such as being manly and not sharing feelings, being the breadwinner, and making lewd comments about women. There are many men that are uncomfortable with this, but they have to act like it comes a naturally to them. As a woman, I personally face more pressure by the expectations of being a member of the upper-middle class of my country than from being a woman. I am extremely limited in terms of what job I‚Äôm supposed to choose, what hobbies and interests I‚Äôm supposed to enjoy, what school my kids are supposed to go to, even what city and what neighbourhood I‚Äôm supposed to live in. I find that a lot more restrictive than the expectations on being a woman, having kids and advancing in my career, looking pretty etc, which are things I personally am excited about.

What I mean to say is that there are expectations coming from everywhere, and in other countries outside the US those expectations are way worse and more restrictive than they are in the US, and that men also face a lot of expectations, in many cases, even worse than what the women face. It‚Äôs not a man‚Äôs world, it‚Äôs the world of rich, extroverted, socially skilled, intelligent, power-hungry men, who naturally have the exact same aspirations and interests than what‚Äôs expected of them.",2023-08-06

"After watching the movie Barbie, I felt a flood of emotions. (See Appendix A for a full list.) There was joy, there was sadness, but most importantly there was optimism. I felt hopeful for the future of Barbieland and humans. Tears left my eyes and I rejoiced among my fellow women (for image, see Appendix B). The director, Greta Gerwig, (playing Barbie) skillfully applies several rhetorical techniques and writing strategies to drive home a central idea, such as but not limited to: characterization, conflict, denotation/connotation, metaphor, simile, irony, language use, point-of-view, setting, structure, symbolism, theme, tone, and 1937 others (see Appendix C). There is clearly enough strong and thorough evidence from the text to support this analysis (see Appendix D). The movie also followed the conventions of standard written English. 5/5.  


In our modern world, we make thousands of minor decisions every day. Although some of these may seem minor, questions in decision-making, as many may have larger impacts on our lives & these decisions may amount to larger amounts of stress. Although, as Sec. Powell had stated ""The key is not to make. quick decisions, but to make timely decisions"" Powell's argument acknowledges a great point, that making decisions in a timely manner may be more beneficial than rash decisions, although it may be beneficial at times to make quick, in-the-moment decisions, in most cases, taking your time to make a decision may help you to discern the better option. Many examples of where making time to make decisions may be helpful may be in College Decisions, Exam-taking, and Chess. These ideals are on full display in the movie Barbie.   


In conclusion, the movie ""Barbie"" evoked a wide range of emotions within me, including joy, sadness, and a profound sense of optimism. Through the skillful use of various rhetorical techniques and writing strategies, the writer effectively conveyed a central idea that resonates with themes of characterization, conflict, metaphor, and more. This analysis is supported by a plethora of evidence from the text, as demonstrated in the provided appendices. The movie not only adhered to the conventions of standard written English but also masterfully employed elements such as setting, symbolism, and tone to enhance its impact on the audience. Truly, we have been blessed with a masterful commentary on the world as it is today, and generations will reflect on this for centuries to come.",2023-08-06

I thought it was less to do with that (I didn't even think of that when it happened) and more to do with the implied generalization/allegorical meaning of men essentially being more interested in power and one-upping other men and this often includes women as commodities to have power over (if I remember correctly the montage of ""masculine"" things were all power-related whether or not they dealt with women). I remember thinking at the time that the subtext was that patriarchy encourages power hunger for material and immaterial things--one of those things being women--and their idea to put them against each other was a way to make that power structure implode.

I def. think using horses or something like that would have lessened the impact of that messaging. I mean there is maybe something else that could have been done that could be as impactful?

But as a kid you don‚Äôt see that, you just see Barbie. Barbie who is a doctor or president or lifeguard or just generic Barbie and you never question it, you just feel like this Barbie is fun and you want to be her. 

It‚Äôs the transportation of Barbie into the patriarchy of our so-called real world century city that demotes the idea of Barbie being everything into Barbie being a literal object plaything, in the way, or accessoried, too emotional or otherwise. We as a society have stipulated the notion that Barbie is a setback when she isn‚Äôt. Your comment is the true distillation of the film! The common thought of Barbie being such a step back for feminism translates to surface level interpretation that‚Äôs really more of a commentary on the frustrations of everyday women versus the actual dissertation that Barbie is a patriarchal vision.

Unfortunately he went to far by completely overthrowing the Barbies, but they weren't totally innocent either, after all they were pretty awful to the Kens (and honestly continued to be after the resolution of the story, not even allowing them a single seat on the supreme court for example).

The end of the movie shows the beginning of change but it's still a pretty oppressive society for Kens. When you look at it similarly to how women are treated in real life you can kind of understand why they rebelled against the Barbies.",2023-07-23

Ending on that 'joke' was more-or-less the point of that bit going the way it did. It's the sort of joke that's intended to make watchers go ""wait a sec..."" after it hits.

If a watcher feels like women have it great in the real world, then that line should means they think Kens will land in the perfect spot.

If a watcher feels like women still have a more slightly raw deal than they'd like to see the Kens have, that might be something worth examining further.",2023-07-25

"> Which I think weakened the feminist message a bit, by conflating problems that are just innate to the human experience with gender dynamics

I think this is a common mistake people make about feminism. Feminism doesn't just liberate women. It liberates men as well. The reason is that feminism isn't about letting women act like men. It's about removing what we might call patriarchal requirements. This is the ""dismantle the patriarchy"" stuff that can't possibly be treated carefully in a 6 second tik tok but makes a lot of sense when you encounter it in long form.

I remember reading an essay in high school about twenty years ago, that one thing feminism will deliver is men no longer having to shoulder the exclusive burden of providing for a family, which is emotionally taxing and generally only gets lip service.

The issues the movie discusses (patriarchy, toxic masculinity, feminism, allyship, etc.) are all closely related. The idea that it's OK not to be excellent could probably be considered in relation to toxic masculinity. That men historically are pushed to excel, because men generally relate to each other through a power hierarchy, so men are supposed to ""climb up the ladder.""

So when women start getting more rights, they adopt the same idea. One might consider this idea, therefore, a toxic trait of masculinity that is foisted on women who leave the home for work.

The idea that it's OK not to be excellent is, therefore, a different way of addressing the idea of needing to climb the hierarchy at work/in society. Rather than ""women should be like men and excel"" it's ""men should not be expected to behave in this unhealthy way.""

There's a difference between doing something because you're passionate, and doing something because you *need to win*.

Now there's a larger issue around society *needing* people to do jobs that no one is passionate about, or else society can't exist, but that's outside the bounds of the movie.",2023-07-25

Whilst that's true the first female supreme court judge was only appointed in 1981, many decades after it was normal to see women practicing law. I think the point was that equality wasn't something women got overnight, it was a series of small victories over many decades that got us to where we are now.

"I think the underlying theme was that the Barbies believed they solved sexism, only to learn they didn‚Äôt. The Barbies, like the rest of us, cannot completely solve sexism. The movie was satire and purposefully subverted gender inequality to show that dominance of either gender is bad. The conclusion was that things were made better for the Kens, just as feminists have made life better for women - but it is not perfect. Ken learned two things: (1) he does not need a relationship with Barbie (a woman) to have a life‚Äôs purpose; and (2) he does not need to be more dominant or masculine to be manly. Barbie learned that (1) inequality between either gender is bad (she realized this by experiencing sexism); and (2) perfection, emotions, etc. pales in comparison to a the full spectrum of human emotions.",2023-07-26
"I don't think the movie attempted equality; it highlighted the existing age-old systemic inequality, to remind the viewer why we have to continue fighting for true equality and not simply trying to disempower other groups.  

In regards to Barbie dmbing down men... Men have been in positions of power way more than women have throughout the world's history, and men in power are responsible for the birth of capitalism, war, genocide, global lead contamination, and of course, global warming. So it is arguable that they have in some ways ""destroyed"" the world, or at least established and enforced corrupt, exploitative systems while historically abusing and dehumanizing women. Who knows, maybe if more women had been in power throughout history, we'd  have a lot more women famously responsible for doing horrible shit, too. But that doesn't change the facts. Now, of course not all men are evil or dumb, but they definitely *can* be dumb and/or horrible. For the record, the same is true for women. But I do think the Barbie movie went a bit overboard with the ""men dumb"" stereotypes (even if I did find a lot of it funny, as a man myself). I also thought the role reversal was rather interesting, the Kens being made sympathetic, oppressed and limited under Barbie rule and having to accept and make the most of their lower status after their uprising failed.    

I agree that there was zero subtlety or subtext, that a lot of the female empowerment was lamely ham-fisted even if the message was still good stuff. Actually, thinking about it, I like how the complex issues and struggles women simply learn to live with are plainly stated, since many women might not know how to fully articulate why life is so damn hard for them, or maybe no one around them would listen if they did explain it. Maybe that lack of subtlety, of not skirting around the issues or merely implying, but baldly stating, was cathartic for a lot of female viewers.  

And I did also want more for Ken in the conclusion. He'd had all that lead-up, complete with an awesomely 80s rock ballad, and then his arc quietly fizzled out without a definitive conclusion. I liked that he was ""Kenough,"" but I wanted a scene that solidified or hinted at his next steps in life, as we got with Barbie.

It was Ken who couldn't take a hint and was obsessively pursuing her. She never showed him any special interest. It might have been a kindness for Barbie to be more blunt in her rejection as she was in the end, but, as we saw, she had to come to terms with not wanting to hurt his feelings/not wanting him to hate her, and Ken also had to get a life/develop a sense of self so that he could receive the rejection and move on.

There are men who act like their owed a woman's affection because they like her, and women often grapple with not wanting to be disliked for rejecting a man they're not interested in.",2023-07-25

Although I really enjoyed the movie, I totally agree with you.

"Yeah, I‚Äôm in the same boat. It was funny and had a good message, but it got a little annoying how many times they kept explicitly stating what they were doing. 

First example I can think of is when the mom had that speech about what it‚Äôs like being a modern-day woman (which made me kinda cringe but I didn‚Äôt disagree with the sentiment) and the side-character Barbie was broken out of her trance. Then the main Barbie (Margot Robbie) says something like, ‚ÄúBy calling out the patriarchy, you got rid of its power!‚Äù

Ken goes into the real world and the patriarchy is forced upon him by visual cues etc. A nod that men are born obviously but gender roles are forced upon them too.

The moral is patriarchy and matriarchy are ideals created by humans but not part of being human, they are thrust upon us.

">Are they really that bad,

They allude to it in the film as a change but Barbie's more inclusive and realistic nature is all relatively quite new.

The Barbie model for a long time was standard dimensions (official to make the clothes and accessories interchangeable between dolls) which critics said created unrealistic expectations in early youth on body image. For context, that standard dimension model, if scaled at 1/6, would equate to a 5'9"" person. At those dimensions, Barbie would have measurements of a 36 inches (91 cm) chest and 33 inches (84 cm) hips while having 18 inches (46 cm) waist! That was only changed in 1998, and different body types were only included in the late 00s.

And on diversity, while there was a Black doll introduced in 1968 for example, it was (first not a Barbie but given an alternate name as a 'side character') a recoloured version of the same mould of Barbie, which thus didn't account for actual physical attributes more commonly seen in Black women - instead just using a white model (and thus more ethnically eurocentric beauty standards - already out of reach for most girls) - concerning a la Black is Beautiful movement. Same with the first iterations of the hispanic Barbie lines, which were literally just the white Barbie model - colour and all, but with 'Cinco de mayo' accessories. But moreover, a lot of these racially diverse Barbie were 'tagged' as their ethnicity. So while there was, quite progressively when it started, Professor Barbie and Astronaut Barbie and Doctor Barbie, etc. Until relatively recently, they were almost always white model Barbies. While for example, the hispanic Barbies were advertised and modelled as ""Cinco de Mayo Barbie"", ""Matador Barbie"", ""Carnaval Barbie"" etc.",2023-07-21

"What I see a lot of critical reviewers miss is that the ""feminist utopia"" of Barbieland was explicitly meant to be a conception of female empowerment viewed both through a patriarchal, capitalist lens (Mattel) and a fantastical, naive one (young girls playing Barbie). It was not meant to be a literal example of what feminism should work toward. 

Obviously I don't speak for all queer people but I felt Allen was queer-coded in the movie, and the entire aesthetic of the film itself felt like representation! Again, Barbieland was constricted by Mattel's designs and if Sugar Daddy Ken and Earring Magic Ken had more than brief appearances they would have just contributed tired flamboyant gay male stereotypes.

"I think you missed multiple points the movie was making. The whole point was that feminism is that women are just regular people and shouldn't have to live up to the expectations the world wants of them, not that they should have power above men. Remember when they said ""It's Barbir, and It's Ken""? Not Its Barbie and Ken""

The Ferrera speech wasn't just her lecturing the women, she was letting of steam and explaining the troubles women have in our male dominated society. Barbie 'getting a vagina' at the end was her finaly becoming human and accepting all the nuisances that that entails. On the point of queer representation; does Barbie as a toy have that? I am all for LGBTQ rep, but they were reflecting the real toys and their lineup.",2023-08-14
"> the notion that feminism is ‚Äòwomen hold positions of power, while men are inconsequential supporting characters‚Äô

That's not at all the message of the movie.  In fact, the movie pretty explicitly states that this dynamic is broken in the same way that the patriarchy in the real world is a broken system.

The fact that you didn't get this tells me that you didn't *want* to get it, because it's impossible to miss.  You just wanted an axe to grind, so you misinterpreted the movie in whatever way you needed to in order to reach that conclusion.

I liked it BECAUSE it treated Ken and his issues seriously and didn't just make him a big bad evil man lol",2023-07-21
"I didn't mind the apology from Barbie to Ken. She did more than not like him back romantically (which is not a problem and shouldn't be apologized for). But she does disregard him, make him feel unwanted (I don't mean romantically), and the whole barbie land relegate Kens to inferior status. While not liking him romantically, she does consider Ken her friend, yet ditched him every night for ""girls night"". He was always an afterthought to her and she needed to apologize for that. Only thing id have changed is also had Ken apologize for his toxicity as a ""nice guy"" and the feeling like she was his object to have. I couldn't help but feel for the guy and then the next moment he'd do something douchey like try to kiss her despite her objections and he'd lose all my empathy. 

The Will Ferrell/Mattell arc was pretty useless and should have just been scrapped. It added nothing to the story. 

I felt the gyno joke was just that she was a human and now had a vagina, I didn't read anything else into it other than seeing it as a callback to the joke earlier in the film.",2023-07-21

"I think you're missing the point that Barbieland is the world of young girls' imaginations as they play with their Barbies. The men in that world are unevolved after thoughts because young girls don't have any thoughts about men, really. They're just there to be accessories for the Barbies. Real World Girls playing with their Barbies only think about the lives of the women they fantasize about becoming. It's a matriarchy because that world was created in the minds of young girls. Obviously Ken is upset about this, even if he doesn't really know how to voice his dissatisfaction.

After going to the Real World, however, and seeing how dominant the lives of men are relative to those of women, he decides that's why he's unhappy. A woman actually asked him for the time and he was ecstatic! So he returns to Barbieworld to create the patriarchy. There are no humans in the Real World making this happen, the Kens are just trying to recreate what he saw while in LA and, like everything in Barbieland, it's ridiculously exaggerated. The movie is no more claiming that men all demand to be waited on by women in skimpy maid outfits than it is saying all woman are scientists, presidents, lawyers, judges, etc. with Barbie bodies.

At the end, it returns to a matriarchy not because that's better than a patriarchy but because, again, Barbieland is the manifestation of young girls' fantasies.",2023-08-06

"The ""where did you learn to drive like that?!"" scene wasn't bashing Gloria's husband, it was poking fun at the fact that the daughter assumes her dad was the only relationship her mother ever had (as I suspect most children assume until they reach a certain age) and Gloria didn't want to disabuse her of that notion. All parents go through a version of that conversation, I'm sure. I remember asking my mom if dad was her best friend in first grade (they met after college).

Films have been making fun of dorky men/husbands for many years, doesn't mean they're anti-men. That's like saying ""Ed Helms' character's wife in 'The Hangover' was overbearing and controlling, therefore this movie is anti-woman.""",2023-08-03

"It's actually quite sweet if you ask me. I think a lot of it has to do with perception. A lot of men might read that as ""beta"" but I think women don't really see men through wrongly assigned wolf factions. 

His not being the guy who taught Gloria to drive like that is really for the daughter, who in the future will likely learn about her mom's past relationships. And to extrapolate from the given info, her husband likely knows about her exes. As for the Duolingo thing and him learning Spanish for his wife and daughter, that's just so sweet. He doesn't have to; they already have a shared language. But he wants to and is taking the effort. 

Also, I know they don't see him as a ""beta"" because right before the Duolingo bit, the kid's like ""what about dad??"" and they're like he'll be fine. His world is not going to fall apart because his wife and daughter are not around. He'll be okay.

Guy here, and I felt a little confused at the movie as well, and my partner shared similar feelings when I explained my side to her. The movie is a little self-contradictory in several ways, there's a theme of women not needing men and needing to stand on their own, but Barbie-land is already a world where women have all the power and seemingly don't require the men that exist there.

"To answer your first question- no, I think that line made perfect sense in the context of the film and in the spirit of its self-awareness.   


For one, stereotypical Barbie is pretty much the textbook example of a white feminist. She thinks her brand of feminism has saved the world and fixed all problems with equality. She‚Äôs blissfully unaware that early and mainstream feminism only helped people who look like her. That‚Äôs why it takes two women dealing with intersecting identities of being Latino and a women in the real world to shatter Barbie‚Äôs lipstick feminist fantasy.   


So, it makes sense that a young teen bitterly aware of and learning to live in those dynamics would be the one to deliver that line. It‚Äôs on brand with the speech she delivered in the cafeteria too.   


Also, I don‚Äôt think Gerwig being white is a fair critique of using that line. I‚Äôm white, and was absolutely aware of that concept and others like it before watching the movie. Not all of us are living in Barbieland! Plus, being white is probably made it more necessary to include that line. If she didn‚Äôt, people would be criticizing her perpetuating the white savior trope instead of being aware of it.",2023-07-26

"The movie was very tongue in cheek about a lot of the subject matters though, and I'm sad that you came to the conclusions that you did about it.

>the whole point of the film is how men are terrible sexist creatures that have ruined society

The point is that toxic partriarchy is bad for both sexes though. The martriarchy in Barbieland is not supposed to be portrayed as better, but only a reflection of the partriachy. If not they wouldn't have inserted the obvious 'equal but not really equal' line the President Barbie made at the end. Yeah it's a sign of progress, but is it a fair and equal move? I think we can all see the tone it was trying to portray.

>what‚Äôs so terrible about cellulite? Why do women have to be amazing at all times?

But that's Barbie entire storyline? And that at the end she doesn't want to be chasing the amazing but unachievable ideal Barbie represents but embrace the imperfectness a woman has instead, cellulite included. Had Barbie stayed in her perfect world, then yes the message of the movie would fall flat, but that wasn't the case.

Yes, women's place in society has been better, but the fact that you are supposed to feel upset at the line 'Men in Barbieland has as much power as women in the real world' is exactly the point the movie is trying to deliver.

That just my takes on the movie, but I respect your takes. It's completely possible that the movie just isn't there yet to deliver its message. Movies are also subjective to viewers own personal experiences anyways.

>It also feels that the parts that aren‚Äôt filled with overly politicized feminism were replaced by those dumb dance numbers and horribly stupid ‚Äúbeach war‚Äù scene

>Ken makes only the most minor effort to introduce the concept of logic to this world and immediately takes the entire place over. Not only does he become the ruler of the entire world, but the people he is ruling over seem to be happy about it.

They clearly explain this in the movie. Barbies aren‚Äôt people, they‚Äôre ideas. When a new idea is introduced to Barbieland the Barbies immediately absorb it and start acting accordingly. So when Ken introduces the idea of patriarchy and men ruling over women (not ‚Ä¶ logic?) they all go along with it.

That's a very shallow interpretation of the movie but ok.,2023-07-28
"To be fair, from one perspective it can look that way, but I do think that the movie critiques patriarchy as a whole rather than Men. 

Men feel as empty in the system as women do. Is it problematic that they have more power, opportunities, favour, ability to succeed, grace, etc? Yes. And the film addresses this wonderfully through America Ferrera's speech to the Barbies. Ken might seem left without a resolution, and so you have Barbie's insistence that he figure out who he is outside of her. His shirt ""I am Kenough"" speaks to this journey. The movie is poking fun at stereotypical masculinity not men themselves. So many feel unheard and unseen. We just see this through the lens of humor. 

The target audience is women, but this is not just a movie for women; it's for men too. Those who never got the chance to claim empathy and compassion as their own. Barbies/women being the best thing on earth is also tongue-in-cheek. The pink-filled constitution signing is supposed to be missing something, and we do see the characters and story recognize that a simple reversal of reality and power is not enough or good.

It's not feminism, id call it more human empowerment. A call to be more self-actualized and  gracious. 

Since our society isn't perfect, the movie's ending can't be perfect since it's dealing with ongoing problems of how we see ourselves and those around us in a messy world.",2023-07-29
"The Matrix and Titanic are certainly not the movies I would think would have the ‚Äúbest‚Äù reviews on Letterboxd, but they‚Äôre certainly good examples of the type of movie Barbie is right now, and the cultural moment. Regardless of how ‚Äúgood‚Äù Barbie may or not be, it has created an experience where people feel like they are participating in something, and there is a lot of enthusiasm and love for it beyond its objective filmmaking quality. This same thing happened to Titanic and the Matrix, two movies that are far from perfect but created a fervor.

Most people do no have positions ‚Äúon the culture war spectrum.‚Äù Most people have values and interests that and Barbie is honestly pretty middle of the road when it comes to these things. The letterboxd reviews are not the product of liveral groupthink. 

I think this movie knows who its target audience is (a pretty lame term that‚Äôs for marketing firms, not film makers or ‚Äúcritics,‚Äù it‚Äôs lame). The target audience is everybody. It‚Äôs very broad. 

It may turn of people who can‚Äôt handle the idea that a man is the butt of a few jokes, but that‚Äôs okay. And some people simply may not think it‚Äôs very funny. But there are people who legitimately love this movie and it has nothing to do with this ‚Äúculture war.‚Äù",2023-08-05

The film goes out of its way to make that point by having Barbie initially believe that it's the young girl who is having thoughts of death, self-doubt, etc.  In reality, the kid's got it together and is already a strong feminist, while it is the adult who is having the existential crisis

"The hatred shown to Barbie is actually specifically what resonated with me the most as a girl who grew up playing with her lol

The target audience for this movie was absolutely those little girls in the beginning who were excited and inspired at first by a doll who wasn't a baby enforcing gender rules about softness and motherhood. We then grew up into teens who chafed at the gender roles she *did* enforce, the pink and the thinness and the makeup and sexless heteronormativity. And then we became adults and moms and career women who were able to look back with mixed feelings to appreciate the good and the bad of what Barbie represented for us: our own flawed ideas of womanhood that we reshaped as we aged.

There's a reason they made a point to have that scene of Barbie complimenting the old woman and her replying: ""I know it"", while the younger real women of the movie and Barbie herself get caught on the idea of ""pretty"" and struggle. It's a common journey for women and our self-image.

The fight sequence was hilarious not because ""men are stupid"" but because these are the only things Ken ever gets -tennis racquets, rollerblades, and MAYBE a surfboard. That's the irony. HE's the one who needs cheering up.

Now as for Will Farell and the Mattel board. Yeah, that's just there to be silly and funny and make the point that this character that's supposedly an inspiration for women has been controlled by men for most of her existence.

"I think you're missing the point if you think this movie was calling all men dumb or saying their interests are dumb. It was mocking toxic masculinity and the ideal that men have to act a certain way to be manly, which is what the Kens did with their newfound knowledge of patriarchy. However the Kens aren't meant to be evil villains, they are just misguided. 

All of the characters in this movie are complex and there aren't really ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". The Barbies and Kens are both very shallow and clueless at first and their society is very warped. The movie is basically about what happens when the ideal Barbie Land gets unexpectedly mixed with the harsh realities of the actual world. 

Sure it pokes fun at some standard douchey guy stereotypes like the classic ""white guy with a guitar"" or condescending over explanation of movies or finance, but it never says the things the Kens enjoy are dumb or wrong. What was wrong was the fact that Ken, with his newfound ideals, decided to oppress the Barbies instead of forming his own identity. Which is actually something that happens in the real world (oppressed groups who suddenly find a lot of power become the oppressors). In the end Barbie helps Ken realize he can be himself and his identity doesn't have to resolve around her or whatever toxic masculinity decides he should act like, the Kens should just be themselves.",2023-07-23

Movie had moments when it came off a bit preachy and lecturing the audience about the issues facing women.

Now, for funsies...

""How did this get made?"" - I found out that Margot Robie approached Greta Gerwig. Love it, I've never been a Margot Robie fan, but now she has my interest.   
  
""What the actual fuck?"" - I asked myself this when I first found out that Gerwig was directing a Barbie movie. Then I got excited.  
  
""Who greenlit this?"" - Probably my biggest question. I would like to give this person a high five. Finally, a summer blockbuster that has nuance and style. I'm not a superhero movie fan, and I finally feel included in the hype!!!  
  
""Will all Barbies come with vaginas now"" - LOL, this is clearly a joke- haven't we all thought at one point or another how funny it is that dolls don't have genitalia?  
  
""Did she HAVE to go to a gynecologist at the end? She couldn't have gotten a job as head of Mattel, her first priority was her pussy?? "" - This is probably the most interesting question. My interpretation: Being a human is not like being a Barbie. It's not a beach party every day, things aren't perfect. Going to the gyno is a human woman experience, not the Barbie experience. Getting a job as a Mattel executive is the Barbie experience. Most adult American women go to the gyno- hardly any are executives.   
  
""What was even the point of the husband?"" - No idea, probably one of the only parts of the film that didn't really jive with me.  
  
""This was, by far, the most rampantly sexist movie I have EVER seen"" - I don't feel that way and I'm confused by this interpretation. I assume it is because the Kens weren't immediately given high ranking jobs at the end of the movie. Feels kind of like men don't really like that idea... and they shouldn't. Another Reddit poster said that it was just the movie holding up the mirror, and I thought that was a great way of putting it.

When you filter out all the endless talk about patriarchy, matriarchy, and equality, nothing is left because that's the only thing the movie focuses on.

And the jokes aren't really funny either. Maybe my taste doesn't match the humor, who knows.

My friends and I have never had such a strong desire to leave the movie theater. Watching it on the big screen also feels unnecessary, with no impressive on-screen visuals or cinema-worthy sound design.

"There are verbal jokes about genitalia (The Barbies and Kens are fictional, and thus do not have any), Barbie says both ""vagina"" and ""gynecologist"", there's an extended joke about the Ken's ""beaching each other off"", and there's plenty of men catcalling Barbie when she first enters the world. 

&#x200B;

However, I would say that most of this stuff would fly over a young child's head. Barbie is never framed as a sexual object (there's, like, one shower scene but she's very well covered. Benefit of having a female director, no male gaze for the cinematography), and female agency is a very important theme of the film. The romance elements in the film are very sterile and immature, a child's idea of romance entirely devoid of sexuality.",2023-07-21

"And not just a female thing but a Barbie thing! My horse girl friend (who actually came up with the original comment) said, ""A little bummed that they made horses a Ken thing when Barbie Riding Club is such a seminal piece of Barbie media.""  

Then again I guess we have that addressed in the movie with ""when I found out the patriarchy wasn't about horses, I lost interest.""",2023-07-26
"I think that was just Ken‚Äôs surface level reading of what equals masculinity. Cowboys riding horses do fit that description, but of course horses are not exclusively representative of masculinity. It was just one thing he latched on to. 

Wearing big fur coats isn‚Äôt strictly masculine. There are other stereotypes associated with coats like that, but he latched on to that one because he thought the guy he passed by looked cool and he wanted to emulate it.",2023-07-29

"Yeah, that line felt like Mattel tooting their own horn ""Look guys, there was never any adult dolls before Barbie, aren't we such a progressive company?""

Then again, the rest of the narration goes on to say that Barbie's creation ""solved sexism"" and ""all women are happy and powerful"", so I guess that was part of the joke? The entire narration was exaggerating Barbie's achievements.",2023-08-01
Yeah but those dolls were still suggesting that  a woman's role in life was to take care of a home and be a mother. Barbie allowed girls at the time to dream about more than being somebody's wife and somebody's mother.,2023-07-23

I think I only noticed it when she was considering becoming human, so I thought it was related to that.",2023-07-31
I have a strong feeling it‚Äôs cleverly planned. They could have tried to make her way ‚Äúuglier‚Äù but instead they opted to just make her a little dishevelled because they knew even if they did more it wouldn‚Äôt convince us Margot was ugly.,2023-08-16
"Sorry to necrocomment but I think it also speaks to how conventionally attractive women's mental health can be dismissed. ""Why do you care so much about how you look, you're gorgeous!"" but regardless of how attractive someone is, everyone struggles with self-image and society's idealised vision of what beauty looks like. Arguably for women who are considered attractive this comes down harder because they are more scrutinised, objectified and has so much of their societal ""worth"" tied up in their image. So while it was a funny joke, I think it does speak to real mental health issues re societal expectation and self-image.",2023-09-04

"I felt like that was a great theme about how patriarchy affects men, too. Ken was a perfectly fine guy who lacked a sense of self-identity, and the second he encounters strong male role models, he gets way into the toxic masculine rabbit hole, similarly to how many young impressionable men start watching Andrew Tate and these alt-right influences and get a terrible idea of what it means to be a man. It‚Äôs weird growing up for anyone and forming an identity in society, there‚Äôs so many good and bad images (from Barbie to John Wayne) that people model themselves after, for better or worse.",2023-07-23

And I‚Äôm not saying that the Barbie doll and brand is above criticism or change. I think one of the driving points in the movie is that ‚Äústereotypical barbie‚Äù doesn‚Äôt want change, so she tries to avoid it instead of seeing how to grow in positive ways. So change is good. Exploring and being curious is good. But the ripping apart of something like a DOLL or just ignoring the problems and calling it ‚Äútaking back agency‚Äù isn‚Äôt right either.",2023-07-25

This movie had so many layers. It's like my media studies degree exploded into a puff of cotton candy.,2023-07-21
"What impresses me is that a company is aware enough to pull it off. Most companies would be too scared to be shed in a bad light but Mattel was smart enough to pull the ""anticapitalist"" capitalist. 

Not sure how to feel about it but I did love the movie",2023-07-24
"Yea. Dirtiest part of modern democratic party.  They are all capitalists pretending to care about what a liberal does.  Same for the other side.  Its always capitalism.  The ways they manipulate change, but its always there.  Painful to see as an adult the kind of things you buy into when your younger and dont know better.",2023-07-21

Righteous indignation dollar. That‚Äôs a big dollar. A lot of people are feeling that indignation.,2023-07-24
But you really wouldn't know about the anti capitalist sentiment until you've seen the movie. It's not exactly a selling point in the trailers,2023-08-02

"The Barbies were rescued by having a character preach, on screen, about the contradictions inherent in Patriarchy. 

It was a fine movie but that's literally preaching feminist philosophy.",2023-08-08
That wasn‚Äôt her daughter on the bus bench.,2023-07-22
When Barbie said 'you're beautiful' to the bus stop lady I definitely felt my throat hitch and my eyes dampen.,2023-07-21
Was so sweet! Followed by her quip ‚ÄúI know it‚Äù,2023-07-21
Correct. Tbh the scene kind of gave off a cameo vibe so that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt question it.,2023-07-22
yes because corporations are known for their transparency and spending lots of marketing dollars with no regard for ROI,2023-07-28
"Mattel CEO literally just went on tv asking investors to hold tight for the financial impact of Barbie next quarter

"I think Mattel was involved,  they didn‚Äôt write the movie but they still get final say on everything",2023-07-23

"Fun Fact: The Mattel exec is played by Jamie Demetriou, the real life brother of Natasia Demetriou, who plays Nadja in What We Do in the Shadows.",2023-07-27
We also had a random two second Rob Brydon cameo and one of the Derry Girls. I haven't looked it up but based on the number of Brits rounding out the cast in smaller parts I assume they shot the Barbieworld stuff at Leavesden,2023-07-29
I knew hot lawyer sounded familiar!!,2023-07-22
They even paired Ncuti and Emma as Barbie and Ken.,2023-07-21
"Apparently they were originally going to do a joke like that, but ditched it because they didn't think they looked that much alike when they were actually standing next to each other.",2023-07-22
What makes you say that? Do they know each other?,2023-07-23
Wait who is she?,2023-07-25
Oh my gosh I didn‚Äôt even catch that pun thank you that‚Äôs so funny,2023-07-25

Went with my Jewish best friend and we both burst out laughing at that part. Totally caught us off-guard.,2023-07-23
He's just grasping at straws about being progressive.,2023-07-22
It‚Äôs a joke that people like to say ‚ÄúI have a Jewish friend‚Äù to prove they are open minded and often as an excuse to say anti-Semitic stuff. (Also: ‚ÄúI have a black friend‚Äù),2023-07-22
Also! The creator of barbie was jewish so I took it as that was who his friend was,2023-07-23
The horse lampshade in the background while he was crying on the bed got me.,2023-07-21
Just the constant slow motion horse running as his TV screensaver,2023-07-21
There‚Äôs a wide shot where it shows all the houses and they‚Äôre all playing the same fucking horse clip on loop.,2023-07-22
You serious? He has reading a horse book?!!,2023-07-21
I had the exact TV they were referencing with that sticker on the TV haha,2023-07-23

I read that as a Saving Private Ryan reference. Could be wrong though.,2023-07-25
"Like you can tell he has no idea about the social/systemic implications or what any of it really means, he just knows patriarchy means ‚Äúguys rule and horses too :-)‚Äù",2023-07-21
I no joke believe he should be nominated for his role,2023-07-23
I think it‚Äôs the absolute sincerity in that statement that really nails the joke.,2023-07-23
"> Ken is exactly the type of shallow himbo to throw around a word like patriarchy without knowing what the heck it actually means.

I mean, that's probably true of most of the men in positions of power, which I think is the point.",2023-07-23
I love the way she‚Äôs pointing out how it doesn‚Äôt make us happy either.,2023-07-30
ANARCHY ANARCHY!! I don't know what that word means but I love it,2023-07-24
Such perfect casting,2023-08-19
So does that make horse girls... patriarchy girls?!,2023-07-21

Now I just want the horses. lol",2023-07-23

Or Ken just liked the horses and associated the two, that noggin isn't suffering from an overcrowding of thoughts.",2023-08-02

"My husband and I both wore pink, and in the car he asked me ""Do you think we'll be the only people wearing pink?"" And I cautiously replied, ""I think there will be at least one other person in pink."" Turns out my estimate was a bit off because about 75% of the people were wearing at least one pink thing.",2023-07-23
"As a guy who happen to like pink and owns a few pink shirts, I felt really at home lol.  Pink be pimpin.",2023-07-23
Never feel silly for wearing pink. Pink is awesome.,2023-07-26
"I was so excited when I realized that the pink scarf Ken was wearing in the cowboy outfit was the exact same pink headband kerchief I wore to the movie!! Exact same color and pattern!!

I almost wore another, darker, pink one but my roommates convinced me the brighter pink was better. I was so excited and happy to see Ken and I wearing the same damn thing. Made the moment very magical haha",2023-07-28
"I went at noon on Saturday and me and my friend were the only ones wearing pink, the cashier looked at us and just deadpanned ""Guess you all are seeing Barbie?",2023-07-29

"yeah my theatre also decorated, and a bunch of the workers were also dressed up.

"I work at a movie theater and my boss is gay. We‚Äôve never gone as all out for a movie as this one, he even made me bring in my old childhood Barbies and we placed them all over the concessions and bar. It‚Äôs just been so fun. In fact, I don‚Äôt remember a movie that has been selling out theaters like this one has. I‚Äôm talking every showing sold out. Not even Top Gun or Avatar.",2023-07-25
"> The theater I went to decorated the entire lobby in pink balloons and covered the bar in pink table covers

Well that must have been an interesting juxtaposition for the Oppenheimer crowd!",2023-07-22
Infinity war and end game had costumes everywhere,2023-07-21
Just saw it now. The theater I went is a dine-in theater. All the staff referred to us all as Ken or Barbie and had nametags that said Ken or Barbie lol,2023-07-23
"My theatre was the same, and it totally took me by surprise! The most full theatre I've seen in years!",2023-07-23
Love this. I think part of the movie‚Äôs message is to embrace cheesy bc it‚Äôs the most human experience we can have,2023-08-26
"Same! Just got back, every seat was full so much pink!",2023-07-21
Everyone was SO CUTE and fun. It was such a nice and heart warming experience ‚ù§Ô∏è,2023-07-22
"Omg watched this with my bfs sister (11). It was us and maybe 3 other groups of 3-5. Everyone else was SILENT for 80% of the movie while I was giving a full belly laugh for depression barbie (and the rest of the movie) and she had the gall to say ""you were laughing way too much!! I couldn't even hear myself think!!""

She's just pushing her boundaries, I did the same thing at her age, but I thought that was such a weird thing to point out lmaoo",2023-07-21
"That is insane, my theater was laughing so loud I literally couldn‚Äôt hear many parts. The girl behind me had a full blown laugh-coughing fit at one point.",2023-07-22

I rewatched it today and it was packed too!!,2023-08-10
"I really hope the Academy takes this movie as seriously as it should because if this film doesn't win Best Production Design, I'll be furious.

  


Spiderverse needs to win Best Animated Feature and Barbie needs to win Best Production Design. The Academy can be stupid but please don't be THAT stupid!",2023-07-21
There‚Äôs a behind the scenes clip I saw with artists painting the backdrops for barbieland and it almost made me cry. I watched a documentary about the thousands of backdrops hollywood would make for each movie. Oklahoma came to mind first. And there‚Äôs an urgent need to preserve them because most crumble away after being rolled up for so long. So there‚Äôs a restoration effort to make sure these iconic pieces which looked so realistic to the viewer but are wildly surreal are able to be shown to the public again. I‚Äôll edit it with a link. It was definitely throw back to old Hollywood for sure,2023-07-22
It‚Äôs got that Oscar for costumes and staging locked down.,2023-07-22
I had no idea there were no green screens. Makes the movie even more brilliant.,2023-07-22
For real! The first 20 minutes I was like...why does this feel like Edward Scissorhands?,2023-07-26
That‚Äôs kind of the point. It feels jarring to go to reality.,2023-07-25
"That must have literally been the first old person Barbie has ever seen, right?",2023-07-23
"Not dramatic at all, it was a stunning scene. The fact that so many emotions were evoked with only a few words spoken is incredible.",2023-07-22
"That was the scene of the movie. It‚Äôs a moment where Barbie first sees what it‚Äôs like to be human, people laughing, fighting, playing, etc and then finally growing old? I found that moment so incredibly profound for a movie about Barbie. Then the movie continued to be poignant and relevant without being preachy and I am just blown away.",2023-07-21
There's a similar scene in the movie Soul which I also love.,2023-07-22
This movie all around would make a good double feature with Soul I think.,2023-07-22
"Yeah that scene was definitely standout for me as well. The soundtrack, coupled with the beauty of the scene, just made it feel so real in a movie about a plastic doll.",2023-07-22
I cried off and on from that point on the whole movie lol,2023-07-24
The first scenes in Barbieland were so smotheringly plastic and weird that coming into the real world made me feel more immersed. It reminded me of Wizard Of Oz when Dorothy steps into the color world,2023-07-25
"Like from The Bear, ‚ÄúEvery second counts‚Äù",2023-07-31
"I‚Äôm so glad. It was the standout scene for me ‚Äî there was just so much meaning and heart and emotion and humanity wrapped up in it.

It‚Äôs weird, I‚Äôve seen all of Greta Gerwig‚Äôs films, and as prestigious and gilded and serious as they all have been, it wasn‚Äôt until Barbie that I really understood her genius. Fan for life.",2023-07-22
"It doesn't move the narrative along, but it sure as hell adds another layer to the ending with Barbie wanting to experience everything that comes with being human. Not something that clicked until reading this thread, but it's a great detail to stumble on while thinking back in the movie.",2023-08-01
"That‚Äôs crazy that anyone wanted to cut that scene because to me, that was the scene that felt the closest to any real kind of ‚Äútruth‚Äù to me. While I had a ton of fun and laughed and really enjoyed the film, I thought a lot of the ways they discussed existentialism, death, patriarchy felt pretty shallow. But that one scene on the bench felt so real and true and beautiful. I really wish Greta could have extrapolated more from that point onward.",2023-07-24
The scene is emotional as hell and imo the most memorable part. You can't cut it and any exec who tried to would be insane,2023-07-30
I didn't expect to get teary eyed so early in the film. Her choosing to be human had so many more added implications because of this scene. So lovely.,2023-08-03
I love that every time I read about the director it's her not budging an inch on her script.,2023-08-20
Wasn't the old lady at the bus stop costume designer Ann Roth?,2023-07-21

"even thought they apparently didn't do that, I honestly think it would have been really cool if they had, I feel like it would have given that line a lot more weight (although ann roth is cool too)",2023-08-01
"No, the bus stop woman was costume designer Ann Roth, and Ruth Handler was Rhea Perlman.",2023-07-25
"And I love that. While the narrator said that, everyone, even people who are perceived to be the hottest people in the world, feel ugly at points. It‚Äôs universal. We all feel ugly at points in our lives.",2023-07-22
"Human beings have that feeling no matter the look, but you are totally right.",2023-07-21
Meanwhile on twitter: ‚ÄúMargot Robbie is mid‚Äù,2023-07-23
"Yep, hardly anyone actually \*feels\* beautiful, we're all taught to look at ourselves at never quite good enough. Looking beautiful and believing it are two different things.",2023-07-23
"I think that‚Äôs kind of the point of the narrator saying that too, though. It would a very easy criticism to say ‚Äúwell Margot Robbie is still beautiful, so that story beat falls flat,‚Äù but Helen Mirren making that critique instead forces the viewer to appreciate the subtext of that scene which is that the patriarchal pressure to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù is so oppressive that even someone as attractive as Margot Robbie *still* will never feel like ‚Äúenough‚Äù.",2023-07-26
Yeah even if they were homeless Beach boys it would have been hilarious to see how they would show that,2023-07-23
well i mean the whole point was that no one gives af about the kens and they dont have houses because theyre treated as second class citizens,2023-07-24
That seems intentional. And at the end of the movie Kens and especially Ryan's Ken get more autonomy.,2023-07-25
"He did, he became close to my favorite side character at the end from the unexpected beatdown he gave to those building-the-wall Kens.",2023-07-21
Him trying to jump the fence instead of running around was hilarious too.,2023-07-22
"I expected Gosling's Ken to be the precious puppy of the movie.

  


But no, it was absolutely Allan.",2023-07-21
I did not expect Michael Cera >!choking out a Ken!< and I now wish it happened more,2023-07-21
"I‚Äôm invited to a Barbie party next weekend where everyone has to go as Barbie in a profession or as ‚Äújust Ken‚Äù. Despite being a blonde 25F‚Ä¶. I really want to go as Allan. 

Allan wasn‚Äôt everything. But he was *something*",2023-07-25
"nice cheering, Kens",2023-07-21
I thought he would be in the show for like a moment and he was so good,2023-07-22
I‚Äôve never seen him show so much emotion,2023-07-22
"I kinda wish they had allowed Allen on the Barbie supreme court.  Just Allen, no Kens lmao",2023-07-27
There's some roles that 100% only work with a certain actor and that's one of them.,2023-07-24
Michael Cera honestly deserved award consideration for Molly's Game and I'm glad he is getting the praise for this that he deserved then.  He's also incredible as a voice actor in the Lego Batman Movie.,2023-07-24
When they introduced Michael Cera as Allan I lost it,2023-08-28
"The dance choreography from the Kens was on another level, the loveliest part is how they all resolve their differences through dance.",2023-07-21
*put your manly hand in mine*,2023-07-24
Also it's brilliant because Barbie the toy has never ever included weapons. So they have to improvise with very extremely silly alternatives. So funny.,2023-07-23
Allan could fight extremely well at the border. I assumed whoever was playing with his toy at the time was using him as an action figure.,2023-08-09
Are you trying to tell me that titty twisters are not a legitimate fighting technique?,2023-07-27
Nothing about that dance sequence was homoerotic.,2023-07-22
"Between this and ‚ÄúNaatu Naatu‚Äù from RRR, it‚Äôs been a good couple years for dance-offs.",2023-07-25
I took three 150mg edibles and I was higher than rent in San Diego. Made this sequence a work of art to me lmao,2023-07-29

I was the only one in my theater to laugh at the joke.,2023-07-23
"That was the best one imo. She said it multiple times and it‚Äôs obviously not a common term. It was like Gerwig threw it in there as ‚ÄúThis is for all the movie fans and here it is again in case you missed it the first time.‚Äù

Really after the opening scene, I was thinking oh shit this is not going to be a normal movie at all. LFG.",2023-07-24
I was surprised given the daughters age that she brought up that reference,2023-07-24
What was this one a reference to?,2023-07-24
I laughed so fucking hard at that line,2023-07-29
"Also toward the beginning I believe, there's a shot of the Kens that appear the same as the ""Welcome!"" shot from Fight Club (I think they said welcome though, could be mistaken)",2023-08-18

"I got Troy from that as well. They straight up copied Saving Private Ryan for the beach landing scene, but the arrows being shot at the landing Kens is unique to Troy",2023-08-05
I thought the discontinued Kens and Allan were a great way to represent the men who are either discarded by patriarchy or want nothing to do with it.,2023-07-21
Because the patriarchy doesn‚Äôt benefit outwardly gay and feminine men.,2023-07-21
Were not all kens somewhat gay coded,2023-07-23

"I loved the whole corporate part. Just Will Ferrell and the suits dissing in a Barbie meeting room, playing with Barbie drumsticks. Doing everything in suits. It‚Äôs was perfect!",2023-07-22

I didn‚Äôt even recognize Allan as queer tbh.  I just thought he was someone comfortable with himself that knew what he wanted.  Maybe I missed how queer he was but either way I loved him for how thoughtful he was.,2023-07-22
"I know they had a story to tell but I wish they would have explored Barbie and womanhood through a queer lens for a second or two. There was a lot of subtext and some one-off jokes, but I needed a little bit more.",2023-07-21
"As a vaguely bi man who works in a woman dominated field, I want to be a Ken, but I'm more likely an Allan",2023-07-22

"To add for those who don‚Äôt know, this line matters because that was Allan‚Äôs marketing strategy when he was released.",2023-07-21

This was easily one of my biggest laughs.,2023-08-26

"I must say, I resent this sentiment quite a bit because while Gosling was given the most to play with of any actor in the movie, Margot Robbie was perfectly perfect, if understated, as Barbie. But what I took away from the movie is that it was very much a group effort and an ensemble cast. I feel like all of them were great with what they were given. The mother, the daughter, Michael Cera, Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon were all in their right place and deeply enjoyable.

What I want to say with this, Ryan Gosling walking away with this movie‚Äôs only Oscar would be a definite net loss and a terrible irony. A wonderfully feminist movie and the man gets all the praise.",2023-07-21

That really worked for the movie imo, because I feel like Gosling's Ken really was supposed to represent that young boy that's kinda lost about their place in the world and tumbles onto red-pill/incel/whatever other nonsense and then makes that their identity. It made for some great humour, but also an antagonistist figure for the movie that isn't all evil.",2023-07-21

"To be fair to Mattel, I do think they‚Äôve done a lot of work over the past 10-15 years on this.  There‚Äôs several different body molds now including a plus-sized one that I see pretty regularly in stores (so it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs only one plus-size barbie that‚Äôs impossible to find).  And even the stereotypical barbie body is [much better than it used to be](https://imgur.com/a/8KjVkXH). And it‚Äôs SO much better than that crazy 80s/90s body with the boobs that were EVEN BIGGER and the waist that was EVEN SMALLER lol.  And they‚Äôve done A LOT of face molds, skin tones, hair textures‚Ä¶ people say they‚Äôre only doing it to make the brand look good but hey, if the result is a more diverse set of dolls, I really don‚Äôt care what the motivation is‚Ä¶",2023-07-21
What? They bring up the unrealistic body image countless times. The daughter does it during the lunch scene and then they bring it up again during the final talking out,2023-07-21
"100%. The Mattel execs were solely in the movie to show the audience that Mattel is in on the joke. Not relevant to the plot but absolutely crucial to the marketing strategy (of the brand, not the movie.) *""I can't believe Mattel allowed this""* is exactly what Mattel were aiming for, and that only works if they make sure you know they allowed it.

I'd guess that's even why they cast Will Ferrell in the same role he played in LEGO Movie. That film was well-received critically despite the whole IP/toy commercial thing + LEGO has maintained a cuddly/feel-good image. Casting Ferrell was like a calculated nod back to that film as if to preemptively neutralize the same discussion/accusations.

Still an excellent movie in many aspects (much less so in others) but it's basically the Pottery Barn episode of Friends thing and I wish people were more able/willing to recognize that while still enjoying the movie for what it is - not to spoil their own enjoyment but just because the implications of \*this\* being the standard for ""subversive"" filmmaking is beyond bleak!",2023-07-21
"I don‚Äôt think this movie was trying to talk about capitalism. It was trying to talk about gender roles and patriarchy and how society starts sending children messages about their identities from early ages and how hard it is to just be a person when you‚Äôre bombarded constantly with messages about how you should be. Barbie (the doll) has been a big part of that messaging, in both positive (Barbie showing girls they can do and be anything) and negative (body image issues, among others). I don‚Äôt think this movie shies away from that at all just because it‚Äôs a Mattel sponsored movie. This could have been a cheap piece of crap (see the Bratz movie from a decade ago) but they put some thought and heart into it. Yet it makes them look good but they let Greta Gerwig have a serious conversation and also a fun, well-made film",2023-07-23

"you could say similar things about the Lego movie, the world just kinda caught up to it more now. I really liked the movie.",2023-07-21
I mean Mattel has been making moves on those issues for almost a decade though. I do think as a company they‚Äôve been trying to transition somewhat. There was a documentary called tiny feet several years ago about them trying to relaunch dolls with better body shapes and diversity.,2023-07-21
The whole point is *why* and *how* does Barbie give women an unrealistic body image and *should* we be that harsh about a doll,2023-07-21
"Copying another comment:

It's not shocking that a corporation would crunch the numbers and realize that saying to your audience ""we're on your side"" is going to sell more products, nothing about the movie will undermine their profit.

What is shocking is if you know how much of corporate world is run by rich dudes feelings, it's surprising how self-effacing the movie is. Disney would never ever make a movie that portrayed their CEO as a bumbling sexist hypocrite, even if it made them money.",2023-07-22
"Thank you for the nuanced comment. I didn't hate it all but despite it's fantastic aesthetic and relentless comedy that lands it could never get over the fact that it's a toy commercial, after all. And for a bizarre 10 minute scene, a chevy commercial too. It felt corporate in a way I was suprised to see from something with Grewig's name on it. Mattel takes some softballs to solidify their brand as self-aware without actually taking responsibility for anything. It is working out really well for them considering the reception the movie has had.",2023-07-21

That REALLY took me out,2023-07-22
And then there was all the Chanel stuff Barbie wears in Barbieland.,2023-07-23
The two buildings visible from the Mattel board room were Warner Brothers Discovery and GM. I thought it was hilarious.,2023-07-23
"My only complaint about the movie really, I know they gotta pay the bills so I get it but that little chase into powerslide they did was a little gratuitous lol",2023-07-23
Ope that‚Äôs what I meant!,2023-07-21
"Was the Chevy an electric car too? I could've sworn it was. If that's the case that was a nice nod, having an electric car beat out all the stereotypical tough giant black SUVs.",2023-07-23
There‚Äôs a big GM logo on a building outside the Mattel executive office (next to the WB building). The product placement was not subtle,2023-07-26
Yes you can.,2023-07-21
None of the stunts are possible irl because it has an electronic e-brake :( fucking travesty,2023-07-21

Antagonist then.,2023-07-23
"Also because everything about the scene is implying she's there for a job interview or somesuch, and then it turns out nope, she's just there for a gynecologist visit. Much funnier.",2023-07-24
Yup! She has a vagina now.,2023-07-23
"She‚Äôs ordinary Barbie!

The scene plays on a stereotypical movie ending where we see the main character achieve/start their Big Dream, but this scene shows us that Barbie is now a regular woman, going about her day, and today just happens to be her obgyn appointment :-)",2023-07-30
"i can see it work in either of two ways, that she does or doesn't have a vagina.",2023-07-23
And honestly the fan made ones look better anyway,2023-08-08
"It was a narrator line. Something like ""Allans have been in the real word before, no one‚Äôs noticed! NSYNC? They‚Äôre all Allans! **Even that one!**""

That one was referring to Justin Timberlake, a member of NSYNC who was obviously gone on to other things, but can't escape his intrinsic Allan-ness. Case in point, the Trolls 3 trailer that was shown before Barbie in my theater, in which Justin voices one of the lead trolls who sings all the time for no reason‚Äî peak Allan behavior.",2023-07-22
"I missed that too, there was a lot going on in that scene.",2023-07-25
"as someone who loves the things he‚Äôs been in, it was disappointing to find out that he‚Äôs allegedly pretty difficult",2023-07-22
I think the joke just simply is that Barbie doesn't know what things are.,2023-08-10
I think that being the joke was making that point.  People who are fascists don't know they're fascists and sometimes people calling them fascists don't know what fascism is.,2023-08-10
"i mean its just that, a joke, dont look so much into it",2023-08-10
I mean the scene with the girls playing with dolls  smashing them then throwing one up into the sky and it transitioning into space barbie is the most obvious 2001 reference ever made,2023-07-23
"It was like a Ted Talk that was good. Plus, her speechifying pushed the plot forward when it became the way to deprogram the Barbies.",2023-07-21
I‚Äôm glad the movie whacks you over the head with the central themes in a very on-the-nose monologue. Barbie has never been subtle it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the film to be either.,2023-07-21
"Dead silent in my theater too. Only at the end did a guy let out a ""YEAH!"" in my showing. I've loved America since ugly Betty and I really hope she gets even more attention after this",2023-07-21
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve worked for me if America Ferrera‚Äôs delivery hadn‚Äôt been so utterly sincere. Yes it was very Greta Gerwig-esque, but she felt the words she was saying very genuinely and you could tell. And the way she goes from passionate and mildly enraged to heartbroken that her world‚Äôs problems are bleeding into a doll, it was really effective for me",2023-07-23
My entire theater clapped and cheered after that monologue lol,2023-07-21
"A comedic break like the Margot Robbie line should've undercut a brilliant monologue like that, but it didn't. It still flowed brilliantly, made its point, AND made me laugh.",2023-07-21
"This is the second straight movie (maybe third, I didn‚Äôt see Ladybird) from Greta Gerwig, where a character gives an impassioned monologue about how difficult life is for women. 

And it‚Äôs a incredible showstopper every time.",2023-07-22
"A little part of me couldn't help but feel the entire message of the movie was that monologue and that it was a little on the nose and preachy. 

But then it was for a purpose to get Barbie(s) unprogrammed and I was okay with it.",2023-07-21
"She really did, and it really resonated.

Actually it was interesting because a friend took her boyfriend to see the movie, and he actually expressed doubts after hearing the monologue. He implied it was not exactly complaining, but something close to that, and I was just thinking huh, she really nailed it then. ""If you point it out, you get told you're complaining."" And, sure enough, a man takes it as complaining.",2023-07-31
And I think she keep coming up with new material for every subsequent ‚Äúawakening‚Äù; just legendary writing and delivering,2023-07-23
Half of the theater I was in clapped and let out little cheers. It was a really powerful monologue.,2023-07-21
I had a woman scream Amen after it lol,2023-07-21
I found it absolutely hilarious but all for the wrong reasons: there was someone in my hall that started a *slow clap* after her monologue finished but I think it was too emotional of a scene for anyone else to join in as well; the way the person's clap fizzled out so quickly because no one else joined in made the entire theatre lose it.,2023-07-21
"I had people cheering afterwards at my showing. 

I wonder after Ugly Betty an Superstore this movie will help her career. She really deserves it imo. She's been so funny for years and deserves it",2023-07-21
My theatre started to clap right after that scene.,2023-07-21
The same thought process occurred in my mind but I was in awe of her delivery.,2023-07-21
My theater erupted into cheers and applause at the end of her monologue. I was (I think) one of 3 guys in my theater and was happy to be in an audience that her monologue really resonated with.,2023-07-22
Reminded me of Sasha Cohen's speech in the Dictator.  It's like someone wrote that monologue and they made a movie around it,2023-07-24
Brought me to tears.,2023-09-23
It really helps that the monologs is grounded in reality.,2023-07-23
"It really did, and my theater clapped. Earlier I watched Oppenheimer and during the blast scene the theater got as quiet as the monologue scene in Barbie. Crazy what a good film can do to an audience, Barbenheimer was real.",2023-07-24
America‚Äôs monologues are incredible! The one she did in Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants always brings tears to my eyes,2023-07-24
My theater had everyone clapping at this scene and then a guy started booing,2023-07-26
She was just spitting facts,2023-07-23
My theater actually clapped after the monologue!,2023-07-23
"It was very Michelle Wolf ""woman who has it all"". It's all I could think of, and she nailed it.

For reference: https://youtu.be/kYBmHEFJLAs",2023-07-23
"It is literally impossible to be a woman. You are so beautiful, and so smart, and it kills me that you don't think you're good enough. Like, we have to always be extraordinary, but somehow we're always doing it wrong.
You have to be thin, but not too thin. And you can never say you want to be thin. You have to say you want to be healthy, but also you have to be thin. You have to have money, but you can't ask for money because that's crass. You have to be a boss, but you can't be mean. You have to lead, but you can't squash other people's ideas. You're supposed to love being a mother, but don't talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman, but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men's bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you're accused of complaining. You're supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you're supposed to be a part of the sisterhood. But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.
I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women, then I don't even know.",2023-07-24
"The little girls in our theater were hilarious, there was a scene where Ken was going for a hug and they gasped ""Ew, don't!""",2023-07-21
Let me know if you find the transcript of that monologue!! Amazing stuff.,2023-07-21
I need it too. I've come here looking for it! Best part of the film for me,2023-07-21

"Nothing much. They show some of the discontinued models they discussed in the film (like the pregnant Barbie and the one who ""grows"" boobs), but there's no tag or anything at the end.",2023-07-21
That specific scene is a touching scene for a lot of girls. The music really made it more emotional. I guess you can really only understand the impact if you‚Äôre a woman.,2023-07-23
[removed],2023-07-22
"Also a foil for Barbie to realize her whole world of women ruling the world is a sham built by yes-men losers. They aren‚Äôt the villains, they are just a product of the social ladder and have it easy, live luxuriously, just exaggerating the narrative that leads Ken to believe he‚Äôs the top of the food chain and doesn‚Äôt even have to do or know anything with critical thinking.",2023-07-22
"The CD joke was really funny to me because Barbie says ‚Äúno one uses CDs anymore‚Äù and Ken interprets it to me compact discs. But before interest rates shot up after this movie was written, no one used certificates of deposit anymore either lol",2023-07-21
I think every man in the audience identified with one of those Ken scenes. For me it was the savings account for sure,2023-07-23
"Lol, fixed",2023-07-21
People still talk about movies and pop culture from 50 years ago all the time,2023-07-21

"That's exactly it. 

We were waiting for the shoe to drop and Will to turn but him just wanting to tickle other execs and taking pride in empowering the girls (in the least creepy way) through Barbie made them endearing.",2023-07-21
Yeah I expected Ken to go back and get the Kens and Barbies and bring everyone to the real world and they have to save Margot from Mattel. Then when they got back and you realized Ken took over it got 1000x more interesting,2023-07-21
My favorite part of the movie is >!the twist where Will Ferral's character reveals himself to be genuinely invested in the hopes and dreams of little girls everywhere!!<,2023-07-22
"Definitely.  I wasn‚Äôt expecting the Kens to be the real bad guys.  The moment he realized that men are the ones on top in the world is like the moment little boys realize it, and the way going along with that power fantasy can be appealing to them.  I‚Äôm glad he chose to actually find himself in the end instead of being a lost cause to the patriarchal mindset.",2023-07-21
"They still successfully represented the patriarchy of the real world. It was just in a more cartoonish way, which was appropriate for the way the movie tackled some of those pretty heavy issues. 

They drive home the point that when you just put a ton of white guys in positions of power, you are not always getting the best and brightest in the biggest jobs. If it‚Äôs not a meritocracy with reasonable societal mobility, you often get a bunch of knuckleheads running an old boy‚Äôs club. 

It‚Äôs a caricature, but there are tons of companies that are like that.",2023-07-24
"I thought maybe they would still turn about to be the villains, representing capital(ism) as the overarching evil. But that would have been too convoluted in the end and I like the resolution they reached with the Kens",2023-07-23
"i made two predictions during the movie, one that the girl playing with Margot barbie was depressed, and two that will ferrell was also ken that had gone to the real world and took over mattel.

i was just as happy to be right about the former as i was disappointed to be wrong about the latter lmao

i mean, his ""im a son of a mother. a mother of a son"" speech really suggested he wasnt either, dammit",2023-07-21

"I think you are right. Maybe there will be a sequel for Ken, and this will be a bigger plot point. The uniformity of the business execs with the low-level cubicle worker in tow, paralleled the Kens at the beach with Alan. The references to the last time Barbie came to the real world and how it terrified them that Barbie was on the loose, but not Ken. Also, the fact that one of the Mattel execs got hit with a toy and needed a sling.",2023-07-26

Dolls are just tiny reflections of human beings after all.,2023-07-21

"Well the others were barely characters. At most, the one with the most lines had, what? Three lines? Four?",2023-07-21
It‚Äôs honestly kind of a funny message about how useless/unimportant CEO types are,2023-07-21
"> \[Barbie\] was the one making stuff happen.

  


Which is more or less how it should be for the protagonist. It's their choices that should move the plot forward.

  


She made the choice to go see Will Ferrel and he was the final thing she needed to see for it to finally click that Barbie \*hadn't\* saved the world.

  


Plus the chase he instigated led Barbie to America's character in an exciting way. So while he was the weakest link, I don't think he was unnecessary or wasted and I still really enjoyed him. 

  


I also think he was there to show that while there are obvious problems in the patriarchal society, a lot of the time the stronger issues can be found closer to home.",2023-07-21

"I always loved how despite Sasha trying to be different from Gloria, she looked back (figuratively and literally) and realized that they were pretty similar in how headstrong and steadfast they are.

There‚Äôs this scene where Gloria chastises Sasha about how she‚Äôs never given a break due to her busy life when Sasha calls her out on her suddenly wanting to follow Barbie, and I thought ‚Äúoh, it‚Äôs a ‚Äòhaha parent guilt trip‚Äô joke‚Äù, but it becomes one of the steps that lead to their reconnection, since Sasha complained about how the Barbie dolls set unrealistic standards for kids like Gloria.


Then, when Gloria and Sasha leave Kendom (lol), and Scott Pilgrim fights the Kens, we see Sasha have a change of heart and her being like ‚Äúwell, I may not approve of what you do, but this clearly means a lot to you, so let me help‚Äù.

The kens obviously make up and don't fight for too long, and then afterwords when the main ken explains to barbie that she didnt treat him right and all he wanted was some form of attention and validation she just said go figure it out urself lol.

On the Kens crying being mocked - you often see that from these feminist type women like Gerwig. They‚Äôre all about claiming they want men to cry more and claiming men apparently want that. Yet there also constantly on about male fragility or fragile masculinity and use it basically as a schoolgirl style insult to belittle men as emotional - either because they actually are emotional or because it‚Äôs used as an insult.,2023-07-30
"Except everyone in Barbieland is portrayed as an idiot too, not just Kens. The woman president literally ends up being a trophy wife after Ken tells her she should just be a trophy. How is that not any different from how the Kens were taken down? Their competence is only surface level. It's not the Barbies who were smart either, someone from the real world had to explain to them why they were being ridiculous. Of course it's not a 1:1, because Barbieland is the manifestation of how children think the world works, if it wasn't clear by how juvenile it literally is. 

Also, I'd argue Will Ferrell isn't even an idiot, just a caricature of an old fashioned big businessman. For example, he was smart enough to realize that the Kens showcasing the patriarchy as rad and cool was a bad thing, despite the high sales, so he's not JUST profit-driven. He's also clearly familiar with Barbieland. He was genuinely invested in inspiring little girls, in the least creepy way possible. Not to mention, it wasn't just rebel Barbies, there were also rebel Kens who understood the flaws of the Ken patriarchy.

As for ""womansplaining"", it makes sense in context for Ken, who again, is just like Barbie. Both are naive and have no idea what to do with their lives. They need someone who can help them along. It had to be Barbie explaining to Ken, because Barbie's attention was the only thing he cared for. Same as Barbie only listening to her real world owner.

Also, the Barbies banking on Kens turning on each other was true until they naturally ended up being friends again, showing that despite their flaws, Kens are totally capable of more. 

As for the real world women, they're not even perfect. In fact, they are blatantly not perfect. They're just normal. However, the reality of normality is what shocks the childish and naive Barbie into thinking deeper about herself. Could there have been more ""smart men""? Sure, I'd agree with that, but only as an ""it would be nice"" thing, not a dealbreaker for an ostensibly feminist movie about one of the symbols of childhood femininity.",2023-07-29

I saw them as men who wanted to be considered important and valued. The problem was that they got all of their self worth from how the Barbie‚Äôs responded to them. Their initial inability to process their feelings and emotions in a healthy way resulted in the ‚ÄúKendom.‚Äù 

The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just Ken‚Äù song was the shining realization that they don‚Äôt need other‚Äôs to tell them that they are awesome and that they just need to be themselves to achieve that inner feeling of fulfillment",2023-07-25

For one, Allan.

For another, I'll refer back to one of my original points that Ken was a sympathetic character *on purpose*. That people like and relate to Ken is not an accident.

""If the genders were reversed..."" They are. That's the point. We do exist in a patriarchal system and as far as movies go, so many come out that treat women as objects that exist to further men or teach them lessons. (Oppenheimer came out the exact same day. If you can see the sexism in Barbie but not in Oppenheimer, that is the point of Barbie.)",2023-07-26

"I had a completely different take. Namely, the Kens weren't too busy fighting each other. That's what the movies showed. They fought each other and quickly realized ""hey, why are we doing this? For a woman? What is the point?"" It is a message a lot of younger guys get these days, namely that they need to find and build themselves up and not just chase women around. Cinema has shown that men are not their job (Fight Club), but also not their girl (Barbie). But if not that, then who are they? And Barbie had a similar moment. Who did she want to be? I don't think it really made big statements like that about the system, as, after all, at least in the west, men and women are equal.",2023-08-08
"That's an interesting perspective. I'm not an American, so what I know about American law mostly comes from watching the West Wing and reading the news, but my understanding was that women are protected under the constitution. I had to do a quick google, but the 14th Amendment says ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""

It uses the terms citizen and person, which apply equally to men and women. 

Unfortunately you currently have some Supreme Court Justices who ignore the law (Scalia apparently says that nothing in the Constitution prohibits discrimination against women) but that doesn't make the law wrong. The problem is with high-level judges and politicians ignoring the law. I mean, there's nothing wrong with adding the ERA, but you should be protected by law right now. 

Anyway, I don't know a whole lot about US law, only what I've dipped my toe into, and you guys certainly need all the help you can get right now! I can't believe what's going on there.

But back to the topic at hand, re Ruth's montage, I think my problem was she set it up by saying she couldn't let Barbie choose the real world without showing her what it was actually like. And then gave her the most one-sided view. That's what I found jarring.",2023-08-07
">Women currently don't have equal rights

Under the law they do. There are some sexist expectations from society on them yes that's true, but those expectations also come from other women. Also when it comes to abortion, a lot of pro-life moms oppose abortion and consider it murder.",2023-08-08

Seems like no one writing the movie actually understood the internal logic they were using",2023-09-14
Carl was completely superfluous he served no purpose. The horses thing was random and almost kind of funny at some moments but not quite. The random long song and dance numbers made no sense and served no purpose. Plus it seemed like they couldn‚Äôt decide if they wanted it to be a realistic or fantasy movie. That was a bit sloppy. I‚Äôm having some trouble articulating my thoughts but there was just so much thrown in that didn‚Äôt have a lot of purpose. It was evident that the story was either rewritten or parts were left out and it also seemed like there was this battle going on between wanting the movie to be edgy and adult but also family friendly and inspiring to children and it just doesn‚Äôt seem like they pulled it off very well.,2023-09-14

You also talk about the Barbies being forced, I might have missed that scene

You have a very interesting perspective. When it happens to the Kens, it's because they choose it. When it happens to the Barbies, it's because it's forced.

Kens were definitely objects before, they had no say in anything. Objects/accessories in skimpy clothes with the kens being shirtless vs objects in skimpy clothes with the barbies in maid and cheerleader outfits.  Kens were serving barbies, barbies were serving kens. It's the same.

Talking about who suffered more as objects/accessories seems to be missing a lot of points to the movie

"They weren't saying it's equality. It's meant to mirror our real world women begin to slowly step a foot through the door towards equality. The Ken's are not put on the Supreme Court but they are giving a lower placement in the court system. It's a step forward. Also Ken ""being able to cry and find himself"" is not just a benefit to feminist women but all men, as we deserve to cry and find ourselves outside of constantly pursuing material things and women. Us men in real life have a hard time obtaining a sense of self without a woman on our arm. Feminism allows women to be themselves away from men. Feminism should also allow men to step away as well.",2023-07-28
"It's a happy ending, but it's not equality.  Ken felt invisible  and disrespected. I saw it as  a metaphor for how women were treated in the era when they weren't even allowed to get a credit card or lease without a male cosigner; they were 'accessories' and not really seen as full people either.

"Yeah I agree with you on this. I feel like the people taking this as the perfect society are just completely misreading the film.

Look at Gerwig herself - how many female directors like her have helmed big Hollywood projects like this recently? Patty Jenkins and Anna Bowden are two of the only ones that spring to mind. Where there are a dozen male directors working on blockbuster projects this year (Gunn, Mangold, Peyton Reed etc.)",2023-07-31

">it paints ‚Äúequality‚Äù as a zero sum game with one gender always on top

I think that‚Äôs a pretty strange reading of the film. If you asked Gerwig what equality was I really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd say that. I don‚Äôt understand how the Ken‚Äôs not having equal representation is presented as ‚Äòwin for feminism! Things are equal now!‚Äô - when the Barbie‚Äôs sign the constitution putting them back on top you can see how troubled Margot is by this, she‚Äôs learned how being underrepresented and being treated as lesser is harmful - which is why she reconciled with Ken in the next scene and tried to build up his self-worth as an individual, while also encouraging broader societal change. 

Like I say - the problem I have with the film is that it gets a bit messy after this point and becomes about feeling lost and lacking clear guidance more broadly - which is fine but feels like they overstuffed what was already leading to a fine ending.

The point is the Barbie world mirrors ours in the opposite way. If you think the Ken‚Äôs getting the same level of social and cultural standing in their world as women do in ours is a bad thing, then it shows gender inequality exists and is a problem.

The point is equality is a long standing issue that takes years to fix - the Barbie land mirrors our world because we project our own views onto it.",2023-07-31

There is clearly exceptions of course. But in general women tend to be a lot more supportive of each other ""You go girl"" type of attitude.

Its a stupid feeling, and I don't know why I feel that way, I should be happy my friends are making a lot of money. But from talking to others they also feel similar, like we are in a constant competition, and thats built internally. Women may feel that but it is a lot less frequent. When I was almost raped by a woman several of my friends said ""bro why didn't you have sex with her she was attractive"" I know for a fact if most girls said that to fellow girls they wouldn't get such a response. Its clearly a prevalent problem with men. Suicide rate is higher for men as well.

Here, Barbie‚Äôs saying Ken‚Äôs not defined by his girlfriend because in the real world, women are regularly defined by who they‚Äôre dating.

It‚Äôs making the audience think about what subservience means and how toxic/nonsense it is regardless of gender.",2023-07-22
"That was simply for the empowering women message not to dunk on men. And the reasons the Kens were how they were is because no one cares about a Ken doll in comparison to a Barbie doll, Barbies are important Ken dolls are not. And the film uses that to put a message out for both women empowerment and also for men feeling validation with who they are.

Its not hard to grasp. Many countries in the world still women are not allowed to have a career. Even in America it wasn't that long ago where women were expected to be mothers and not have careers like being a doctor or a lawyer. We have never had a woman president in the history of this country. Its getting better than before, but come on dude, where do you think we were as a society 30 years ago? And even today in many countries. Let women have something. 

&#x200B;

I have had multiple grown men be entirely puzzled about female genitalia and periods and the like simply because it‚Äôs not deemed important enough for them to know, sometimes even well into a relationship with a woman.

The Barbie movie seems to act as though the patriarchy never held a purpose other than ""sexism"". It seemed to imply all male leaders are sexist and we must stop them. I just wish there was a higher expression of unity.

Even Will Ferrel‚Äôs character is great because he‚Äôs played as satirical but also he actually isn‚Äôt.  That‚Äôs actually how Mattel or any toy company operates.

Also many many comments in this thread are talking about how ""cool"" it was that Mattel let them do this... this movie absolutely talked Mattel up-- it was a glowing branding spin on Mattel that I am beyond confident they are perfectly happy with.

"Commentary was as heavy-handed as could be imagined. It felt like a sermon. And not all of the messaging was positive imho, I‚Äôd advocate more of an ‚Äúequality of genders‚Äù perspective rather than one so obviously adversarial to masculinity in any form- especially obvious in the last 45 min sequence. 

And the plot was about as bad as you‚Äôd expect for a movie who‚Äôs starting point was ‚Äútoy doll‚Äù. It was clear the story was just there as backdrop for the sermon 

There were some funny moments. The set design was killer and Gosling + the dance numbers were pretty entertaining. Pretty bad movie overall",2023-07-22

Men (and women) are more than the sum of the parts of what society tells them to be. I think that‚Äôs the main point. Being human is a difficult thing with pain and a variety of experiences.

"I interpreted the Kens being shallow and sorta dumb as another manifestation of the whole role reversal theme. 

For example, there used to be an actual, discontinued Barbie doll with a bunch of stereotypically ""girly"" voice lines, one of those straight up being ""math is hard,"" which reinforced this socially constructed stereotype of women being dumb and shallow compared to men. In this case, making the Kens these shallow dude-bro archetypes is *supposed* to make you feel mad as a male because that's how females have apparently felt for so long under the patriarchy with the reinforcement of these stereotypes.

As for the Ken crying scene at the end, I honestly just took it as stylized campy acting (Margot Robbie seemed to have a little bit of it too with her falling on the dreamhouse lawn dramatically and stuff, she just has a little bit more of a serious take on it at some parts), but I do agree with you ‚Äì it could've been played a lot more seriously overall to make it less patronizing towards men and make the message have more of an impact on the male audience. 

I loved the movie, but I admit that there are so many ways the messaging could've been improved to connect with men more. It's a story written by a woman intended to educate about the female experience AND be for everyone at the same time. It's a really ambitious set of goals for a movie, so of course these messages got a bit lost in translation at some parts. I think even just small acting choices could've made it a lot better.",2023-08-08
"After the first 20 minutes or so, I was fully expecting your idea to be the angle of the movie. To attack the idea of utopia, use Barbieland vs reality as two opposite patriarchal/matriarchal utopias, and show how anyone's utopia is inevitably unlivable for others. I also agree that Kens in the movie are not presented as real equals to Barbies. But I really disagree with your overall point that the movie is biased against either gender, so let me elaborate.

First main thought: Nothing in Barbieland is a reflection of reality, it's an inversion and exaggeration. Kens aren't representing a whole gender, just like Barbies aren't. Kens are a particular sort of bimbo-ification of men, and at different points in the film they showcase both toxic traits and exaggerated female-gaze traits, as well as genuine positive traits as they grow. Barbies and Kens are both caricatures we use as a counterpoint to reality - this is called out explicitly in the ending dialogue. Yes, Barbies are more aspirational, but that also comes with its own shadow side as described in the monologue scene. To me the core message is that after going through their growth arcs, Barbie ""isn't Barbie any more."" And likewise ""and Ken"" is dropped for ""Ken is me"" and ""Kenough."" Neither of them has to be the caricature anymore. So as I see it, the point of the film isn't to compare men and women directly, but to pick at the edifices we have built up around particular ways of being men and women.

Second main thought: speaking of those edifices, I do think the movie is more confident in how it presents positive femininity than how it presents positive masculinity. ""Where should Kens go from here"" is left as more of an open question. I think this is appropriate and accurate given where we are at societally. Multiple generations have critiqued and rebuilt ideas of femininity. I think the same is happening with masculinity but on a later timeline, so we're still in the ""dark night of the soul"" phase of that process. Thinking hard about what positive masculinity looks like (as distinct from just being feminine, which is often used as a lazy fallback) is a great angle for the movie to push in the current context.",2023-08-08
"Sorry in advance since this is going to be long, but im trying to reply to all your points in more detail.. But Which part showed men being morons aside from the part with the corpos not hopping the fence (which yeah, of course that part would be goofy since it's will ferrell) and Ken misinterpreting the patriarchy (which I thought was poking fun at how amazing some people think men's lives are because of it, and Ken taking it in a literal sense, same with when he expected a job just for being a man bc that's what he understood from the patriarchy book he read)? Maybe I missed some part in there but I don't think I saw any part ripping on men just for the sake of ripping on men. The part with Ken crying didn't seem comedic to me, none of my friends laughed and neither did anyone else in the theater laugh during that point. I think the only part that could be considered ""comedic"" of that was Ken getting all happy when he kept thinking that Barbie was comforting him out of wanting a relationship or love out of him (like where he grabbed her by the waist and she was like no that's not what I meant) then going back to being sad, the comedic part of that was the erratic hot and cold coming from ken, not him crying. Maybe I misinterpreted that but him actually crying didn't seem like it was comedic to me or anyone else, it was the other events occurring that were slightly comedic, but that's what led to his whole revelation moments later that he doesn't need barbie, and that it's not "" ITS BARBIE! and Ken"" it's ""ITS BARBIE AND ITS KEN!"" 

The only thing I thought was a little too much was Barbie being assaulted almost immediately when in the real world by getting catcalled and spanked, but to be fair that is still something that does happen in the real world to women. I don't think it was trying to say ""all men are like this"" because otherwise the whole movie men would be trying to get in her pants, it was just showing some men are like that. I do wish that it showed women doing something like that to Ken since, as a male victim of assault from women, would've been nice to say hey, they also brought up the male side of that issue too, but at the same time I don't want something like a barbie movie to be discussing serious topics of assault in an otherwise cheeky movie.

I dont think the movie was trying to tell men how they need to change, I think it was trying to tell them that they are good enough without having to succumb to narracistic women, which barbie WAS for the first half of the movie to Ken (which was portrayed in a slightly comedic way with the whole guitar on the beach song being Push by Matchbox20 AND with the whole ""it's boys night"" being a reference to how barbie said ""every night is girls night"" when Ken was trying to spend time with her at the beginning of the film, how Ken kept trying to impress barbie or find ways to spend time with her while she kept just brushing him off or being rude to him, etc.) And that they don't need to live up to unrealistic expectations of others and/or women, which was also applied to the woman's side. 


The thing about the barbies picking apart the Ken's doing what they enjoy and finding male interests I thought was the movies way of showing off toxic femininity, much like how it later shows off toxic masculinity. It doesn't outright tell you ""THIS IS TOXIC"" With a big sign, but that's the point, you're supposed to pick up on by interpretation. If someone watched that and thought it was OK, they aren't realizing that the joke isn't about men, its about toxic women.

And yes to answer your question I am a man, and I also am a man who is getting tired of the repeated bashing of males in media. Barbie might not be perfect, but its a good start when you look deeper than surface level. Unless I misinterpreted the whole movie, it seemed like it did great at shedding light on both genders issues without patronizing either side too much. And in the end has a wholesome message for both genders. If the movie just crapped on men the whole time, and made Ken's the antagonists the entire time, or crapped on women the whole time etc. I would have a different outlook on the movie, but it didn't as far as I saw, it flips back and forth between Ken(men) and Barbie(women) being the antagonists, showing the damaging sides of both genders and how their actions can affect the other in a harmful way. I DO though feel like some people are definitely taking this movie way out of context, like for example the whole ""break up with your boyfriend if he doesn't like barbie"" trend crowd. Not only are they doing something pretty unhealthy in a relationship with such a weird ultimatum, but they're also completely missing that this movie is about MENS issues too! I think the problem.right now is too many sources are claiming this as a ""womans"" movie, or a ""women vs men"" movie, which is such a surface level interpretation of this movie and also negatively impacts the chances of men watching this with an open mind (Like i said, i went into the movie expecting it to be trash, i was apart of that group). I'm not insinuating that you are since it seems like you actually watched the movie. But I do feel like the messages are deeper than most people are realizing.


 At the end to find some common ground with your argument, I will say this; I don't think it's fair that the women's issues are very easy to interpret and understand, while most of the men's issues are subtle and hard to pick up on since they aren't ""in your face"" like the women's issues are, but they are still there... in a movie... advertised more for women than men... centered around a franchise that was advertised more for women than men... the fact that they even touched on men's issues in the first place considering its material is a surprise. I can understand some men's distaste for other ""feminist"" centered media which just turns into a bashing men fest, but I really don't think barbie falls into that category. It's not perfect of course but it's a good start, and I appreciate that it isn't just a ""men bad"" or a ""women bad"" piece of media. It's a decent movie that involves healthy feminism and healthy masculisum along with their toxic counter parts. You don't have to like the movie and you're entitled to your opinion, but I really do think this is a positive step in the right direction and is far from being another sexist film. It did something somewhat ambitious for its genre by even considering shedding light on men's topics, and while yes of course it didn't delve into all of them, I think it did a good job at trying to be fair to men and women. I do wish it showed more of men's issues and took it a little more seriously but it still did a good enough job, better than what I expected.",2023-08-08

Obviously the main goal is equality, but I think that the fact that there's *so much backlash* to female power fantasies for not including men enough is eerily reminiscent of the social conditioning where women have to consider men in nearly every aspect of their life.

The entire point is to flip the narrative and show men how women feel in the real world. The fact you're upset over how men are portrayed is half the point. The part you're missing is the EMPATHY to realize this is EXACTLY what women went through. So now you know how they feel :P

But tons of men are still up their own butts and ONLY focus on ""They're making men look bad! That's not fair!"" and stopping there.

It hits the feminist beats of ‚Äúpatriarchy is bad for men too and once it‚Äôs gone men will be able to cry more like they supposedly want to‚Äù - but it‚Äôs a hollow sentiment coming in a movie in which all the men are morons who need to change their ways and are the butt of every joke.

>the movie thinking Ken was a role reversal to highlight how mistreated women are

I thought this too! ESPECIALLY near the end, Ken has a scene where he stops being a dumb himbo for a second and honestly opens up to Barbie and tells her something along the lines of ""Do you see how it feels? To be lesser and ignored? Do you see why I did all this to Barbieland? I wanted to be treated better."" Like. He was dead serious and not joking at all. 

Which is a call back to earlier in the film, when the little girl asks ""where do Ken's live in Barbieland?"" and Barbie is dismissive and goes ""I honestly don't know.""  Like - Ken's are mistreated! Th

And I was like, wow, that is so brilliant - to make us think Ken is the villain and draw parallels to women's suffrage and all that. But they never went anywhere with it. 

>They go on to show that him wanting to change Barbie land is wrong, while at the same time they have Barbie telling the other Barbies how oppressed they are even though they just had a Barbie matriarchy. 

And in the end, all the Kens just accept their position in Barbieland and go back to having an all-woman leadership and only woman in power and no-one to speak for Ken's rights. *Kens still don't have a place in Barbieland.*

Which is ridiculous because feminism is about EQUALITY. The ending should've had Barbies AND Kens on the leadership team. There should never be just one gender in power, no matter which gender. That's like arguing that men shouldn't be teachers or nurses because those professions are female dominated and should stay that way. That's still inequality! 

I'm all for girl power but it's a weird message to push in the movie when it's shown to actively be hurting the Ken minority. They could've just. Cut out the parts of the Ken mistreatment and the movie would be less...mean.",2023-07-26

"I think that it was never going to be a super in-depth look at feminism and for people who wanted that from the film, I understand how it would totally fall short. For me, watching the movie, it felt like the barbies and kens were often how young pre-teens imagine the world to be. Neither Barbie nor Ken (the Margot and Ryan versions) were especially deep thinkers, but both went on a somewhat ""coming of age"" that young pre-teens go through. For Barbie, Greta Gerwig said that she was somewhat influenced by the book Reviving Ophelia (a fantastic book that I recommend) and a main thesis of the book is the change that girls go through as they become aware of all of the hard stuff that the real world puts on girls and women. For Ken, I saw his change as the incel/red pill movement that young boys can go through--there are a lot of things that can pull young boys into this movement that appears to be attractive to them (telling them that men should be powerful and should be entitled to all these things). Again, these were somewhat shallow views since, at heart, this was a movie that was trying to accomplish a bunch of other things as well. 
  
I felt like the message of the movie is that change is really hard and slow but is a worthy goal to keep pushing for and dreaming of. I also felt like the message is that dreaming of equality (i.e. through play with barbies) isn't enough, that you have to work for change in your life as well. And that working for that change as an ordinary person (i.e. stereotypical barbie as opposed to president barbie) is enough and ok. 
  
I also thought that there were a lot of more subtle feminism messaging as well that I liked such as: toxic masculinity harms men who don't fall into the stereotypical masculine mold (Allan, magic-earing ken and sugar daddy), trans women are women (having cast a trans woman as a regular barbie with zero commentary), life experience on women is beautiful. While I think that they could have done more with the diversity (in all respects), it was also nice to see better inclusiveness than I expected.
  
I think it's absolutely ok if this movie didn't connect with you. A film will never be all things for all people. I loved this movie because I did like the messaging (for what it was) and I thought that it was honestly, peeing in my pants funny (the choreographed dance number, the sight gags, the side barbies, i'm just ken, the matchbox 20 serenade).",2023-07-26
I think it doesn‚Äôt have a solution in such like creating a world where there‚Äôs common ground. Not perfect but that is actually equal in Barbie Land. But I think that‚Äôs part of the message. As long as we favor one gender more than the other we‚Äôll never really have a common ground. This is why we saw Ken feel what a lot of women felt and then showed what Barbie felt in response to him AND to how the real world treats women. And how we can treat each other.,2023-08-12

"Interesting but I would argue it‚Äôs to parody the way virtually only one kind of female body type has been deemed acceptable in movies for 100 years.  You see lots of dudes of different ages and body types starting in movies, but the women are nearly all rail thin super models.

This was less a movie about the patriarchy and more a movie of a young woman turning into a woman. It‚Äôs a hard-to-explain concept, but the idea of real life purely for the sake of living is a beautiful message. Accepting growing old. Accepting death. Also accepting life. This scene, and the hand holding scene conveyed this well. 

But it waaas a mini movie within a movie. There‚Äôs Barbie‚Äôs movie which is actually a short coming of age movie, and then there‚Äôs Ken‚Äôs zany comedy in there that was the rest of the movie.

"It's just my opinion on what is valid and what isn't. I'm open that others disagree, but I feel bad that some men can't enjoy the humor. But that's their loss I guess. 

I think Mean Girls is arguably the best comedy of the 21st century thus far and it's entirely a critique of women, especially high school girls, and their willingness to break each other down. If there were women who had a problem with it, I'd definitely argue that they have an inability to look in the mirror and accept some self-criticism.

That's ignoring things like how comedy relies a lot on ""punching up"" instead of ""punching down"". Always has. If you or others think that we're on an equal playing field, I can understand why they think that the humor in this film isn't ""punching up"". 

With that said, I would stress again that regardless, if you can't find a way to enjoy laughing at the some of the douchey stereotypes of men they were poking fun at, idk, take things less seriously. But that's my take and others are allowed their own. I just find it kinda surprising.",2023-07-23

The word ""beautiful"" has many connotations and I think that in this scene, it is used most of them except the physical aesthetic.  Of course, the older woman is not ugly, but I think that the inference in the scene is that beauty is not skin deep.

People can age gracefully and beautifully depending on a lot factors, and those who can see and appreciate that beauty live fuller, more meaningful lives precisely because they look past the surface and see the personality that shines through.

I think a big part of Barbie's journey is understanding this way of seeing and starting to learn how to do it, and this was the first moment where it happened for her.  Barbie saw the beauty of a life lived at full engagement with the world, loving it for its truth and trying her best to change the bad parts.

"In the real world, Barbie was treated as an object, and not respected. She was cat-called, and sexual assaulted. She wasn‚Äôt taken seriously by the police. She wasn‚Äôt appreciated as a person, but treated like an object-like an accessory by the men in the real world. Women hold little-no power in the real world in terms of representation, and do not make up the majority of the work-force. Women often feel undervalued and desperate for change due to this. 

In Barbie-world, the Kens were treated as accessories. Their only purpose- to serve the Barbie‚Äôs. They weren‚Äôt taken seriously. They hold little to no power, and have no representation. The Barbie‚Äôs make up the majority of the work force. The Kens feel undervalued and desperate for change due to this. 

I hope that was a simple enough explanation, but I doubt user NutSackforDayzzzz would understand especially as it seems you keep trying to degrade the women who enjoyed this film as ‚Äúanti-men.‚Äù The truth is, the Kens were not treated even half as bad as women are in the real world, but they were meant to represent a fraction/taste of how they are.

"That's interesting you perceived the scene like that. Personally, I didn't once think of it as mansplaining because Barbie doesnt come across as condescending, overconfident or incorrect. Rather, I took this as one doll (Barbie) sharing very recent learnings about what it means to find value from your person with another doll (ken) who has only just come to grasp that understanding. For me, these aren't humans that have the wealth of knowledge, context and experience that comes from living a life in the real-world that allows them to come to these conclusions on their own. So straightforward explanations are necessary imo, which helps me explain a lot of very ""on the nose"" scenes in the film.",2023-07-29

"It's just not men that don't have it rosy, it's everyone. Life is hard and complicated, and both genders unfortunately have bad defensive mechanisms ingrained into them from years of generational structures and gender roles and expectations, and how those mechanismscreate unhealthy behaviors. (Non-biany or those that identify as both also have it rough but irs a subject that deserves it own potrayal and not shoehorned into a film) The film depicts both Barbie and Ken struggling to figure how to be more than what's just expected of them, but each has an inverse look at it: 

Barbie is someone who basically lived a life of ignorance, bliss and privilege, being the literal ""stereotypical barbie,"" but once her mental health starts affecting her and she begins acting different than what everyone expects, she's told she needs to ""fix it or else she'll be another weird barbie."" So she goes into the real world and discovers everything is much more complicated and harder than what she's always known, and this affects her in such a way that it questions her entire existence, and she realizes that she doesn't want to go back to normal, but wahts to help those in the real world by helping try to create and shape things and be something more and beyond just ""stereotypical barbie"" 

Ken is the inverse of this. In the beginning of the film all of the Ken's are basically the 2nd class citizens of barbie world. Not because Barbies actually hate men, but because when Ken dolls cane out they were designed to just be token boyfriends and companions of Barbie. Nothing more beyond that, just good looking guys to be by Barbies side, fitting the gender role. Beach Ken (Gosling) clearly wants something more than that and clearly loves Barbie but he has absolutely no way of comprehending hiw to do that, because the longstanding gender roles of Kens are just 2nd class citizens with no real say. Stereotypical Barbie is just as guilty of treating Beach Ken this way. 

When he decides to go out to the real world, he sees how it's it's opposite: men are the dominating force and the women treat them with respect. But because he has no context as to why this is or having an understanding of proper emotional control, he sees the ""patrichary"" as he thinks he understands it and takes it back home thinking it will help him be seen. This is the key thing people might not realize about Ken: since girls play with the dolls and as they get older, they can form emotional ties to them, whereas girls never play with Ken dolls, which is why they are so emotionally stunted and dumb. The gender roles put upon girls with the Barbie dolls made them discard any emotional attachment to the Ken dolls when they played with them, thus ""Ken is just Ken"" It's why the Barbies always just brushed them off and treated them as just things. 

When Ken brings back the ""patriarchy"" back to Barbieland, there isn't anyone telling him what he's doing is wrong, because it's just another expected gender role playing its part. Now boys are playing with the Ken Dolls and those gender roles and expectations are being played out. It's toxic masculinity in a nutshell, and it's spreads like wildfire all the way into real world sales. The Ken dolls don't want to give it up because they are being seen and respected, even if it's for the wrong reasons they don't want to give that up. 

When Barbie helps undo the brainwashing and restores order, she sees that she abd the other Barbies were treating the Ken's poorly. She forgives Ken but tells him that she doesn't want to be with him, but that much like she's opening up her emotions beyond what's expected of her, she encourages Ken to do the same and he finally emotionally opens up how he has always felt like nothing and his own insecurities and anxieties, which Barbie realizes they're the same, and that regardless of gender we all want the sane thing, to feel seen and cared about and to be whatever we can set our mind on doing.  Ken eventually grows from this (thus the I'm Kenough hoodie) and realizes he can be more than just what is expected of him and his role as Ken. He can be more than just a attractive guy to serve as a companion to Barbie, he can be his own person who is aware of his emotions and have his own dreams like a Barbie does. Even the other Barbies start slowly giving the Ken's more say in Barbie world. 

The film is 100% about defying the expectations of what traditional gender roles expect of us, both in the classical and modern sense, and to grow beyond that. For Barbie it's about being something more than just what everyone expects of you, and for Ken it's to get in touch with your emotions and not run from or hide them in macho stuff, because all it does is make things worse. 

It's also about mental health and how traditional gender roles expect us to just ignore them: for women it's to just act like they don't exist and put on a fake smile and for men it's to bury them under a false sense of strength. 

There's so much more stuff this film covers so well beyond that I could write an entire essay or do a video on. 

Its not anti-men. It's anti-stereotype. It's anti gender roles.

"Oh you could for sure write a thesis on barbie. The plot is nothing new; we've seen similar stories plenty of times before and they've all been as poorly received. We first saw it with Swifts ""Gulliver's travels"" or even more relevant to Barbie; Niels Klims underground travels by Holberg. The idea of using alternate worlds in media to create exaggerated arguments for the shock factor was invented by writers during the enlightenment. Using these alternative worlds as measuring sticks are something that's still used today in critical movies. You find similar themes in movies like the Matrix, or even to some extent Fight club, not to mention Barbie of course. You could write a lot of pages about the Matrix reference and how barbieland represents Potu of Nazer.

There is also the actual politics of it. How the movie lends from the idea of the matriarchal state of Potu (Barbieland) and builds upon it. The real world is obviously a more egalitarian society when it comes to gender rights than Barbieworld, but the Real World still shows signs of the past. This point is made clear in the end of the movie when the kens are still being associated with being lesser beings even after their ""suffrage"" movement has concluded.

If you focus too much on kids and not work, you're umotivated and hurting feminism. If you are too quiet/polite, people don't respect you. If you speak up at all, you're a bitch. It's truly constant.",2023-12-21
"I do want to make a few comments about this as a female engineer. Mainly just food for thought. 

On the heels/makeup topic, I think that whole dynamic has been fairly complex in terms of motivations and even legality. There's been beauty standards moving towards ""natural"" looks, the passage of laws and regulations forbidding workplace rules requiring types of footwear (depending on the setting), and, as a younger woman, a push toward setting standards and expectations to be whatever individuals prefer for themselves. These are mostly my own observations, so YMMV.

The other part is where I can speak with a lot more certainty, because I definitely applied into engineering programs knowing that being a woman might give my application some extra weight. The whole situation is just...complicated. If you were trying to enter a space that you knew was disproportionately difficult for you to access just a few years ago, wouldn't you think that things like hiring quotas is helping you play on even footing? Opening a door that was previously shut? But even as you're pushing to make sure that you get a chance to break ground where people like you historically have been sidelined, you know that you're pushing into a space where the rules and dynamics probably weren't set by someone like you. You also have to grapple with whether you were hired on your own merit or whether you're the diversity hire, because that WILL materially affect your success in the job, your reputation, and your career. 

Once you're hired, even if statistics are skewing in the direction of gender equality, the fact of the matter is that we are not yet far enough removed from a time of pretty backward gender norms that those people have left the workplace entirely. I encounter women still well pre-retirement who were maybe the first female hire in their team. There are still men in management and leadership roles who hold fundamentally sexist beliefs. It can be something that really hangs over your head, knowing that there's someone in a higher position than you who believes you're lesser than just because of your gender. There are also women whose professional experience involved clawing their way into that space and were put in the position of being competitive with other women. Being sexualized as a matter of course plays into that too--you have to question whether a male colleague is friendly for normal reasons or because he's into you, and whether you need to be concerned about being alone with him. Same goes for managers, clients, etc. How can you be sure you're being taken seriously for your work and not because someone thinks you're hot? If you know that there are people who will not listen to your words but will close a deal because they think you're attractive, wouldn't you use that, since not being taken seriously is putting you at a disadvantage? 

Do you as a 20-something guy have to question whether your positive reception is just because you look nice, or whether they appreciated the content of what you said? Whether your boss thinks you have the same fundamental intelligence or ability as your male colleague? 

It's something that I'm acutely aware of but find very difficult to put into words. I don't mean anything I said to be a challenge, I'm just trying to phrase out some of the things I and other female colleagues have experienced and maybe contextualize them for you to think about.

As a final point, referring to women as ""highly coveted in the workplace"" just for numbers reasons does essentially break it down to being a desirable commodity. Like...the implication is that women only bring value to the workplace in the form of demographic statistics. Once the issue of gender stats is sated, are women no longer coveted? Why is that?",2023-12-25
"I didn't really think so much about that particular word choice, sorry. It was more about the vibe, I didn't want to offend anyone.

For me, the idea of Ken feeling like his existence can only be validated in the form of a relationship and the fact that his insecurity as a man politicized him certainly did give me some incel vibes. 

The movie was actually quite sympathetic towards this struggle of his. And I think it is warranted, because I think often what these men need is a better social circle and a different perspective on life. But I agree with you that the portrayal of men in all other aspects was much less flattering and that really sabotaged the overall narrative a lot.",2023-07-21

"It was the realistic ending though. The Kens' position in Barbieland reflects women's position in the Real World. Sure we're ""allowed"" to be equal now yet positions of power, especially political ones, are still dominated by men.

Having the Barbies fix Barbieland instantly at the end when they've only just begun to grasp what sexism is reinforces the false idea that we've already achieved gender equality and it's that easy to fix systemic problems. You're *supposed* to dislike the inequality at the end and make that connection.",2023-07-22

"What seems highly unrealistic to me is that all these powerful women who have only ever known power suddenly give up their power just so they don‚Äôt have to make decisions anymore. That seems like a very weak explanation. If we draw parallels with the real world, men only ever knew power and when women openly wanted to be included and have a say, men didn‚Äôt just relinquish their power or become ‚Äòbrainwashed‚Äô just so they don‚Äôt have to make decisions anymore. So why then would the Barbies? It makes no sense that they could be easily brainwashed by a group of people (dolls) that they essentially view as superfluous simply because they‚Äôre tired of making a decision. 

If this movie was supposed to be an allegory or even a mirror to real world society, that‚Äôs one of the ways that it fell flat for me.",2023-08-10

"I don't have Twitter so thank you for sharing. It's interesting that this conversation is happening there because a majority of the comments here are not reflective of that at all.


I think that is what the movie should have done and sets up but then doesn't follow through on. If you see a vast majority of comments, that is not the takeaway. Many people are walking away with the Barbie's got one over on the Kens, now they know are being treated like how women are treated in the real world. I feel like you can tell that havinga one-to-one parallel and showing both worlds as wrong and both a patriarchy and matriarchy as wrong was possibly the framework of the movie at some point but then it got muddled somewhere along the way. I don't know if they changed their mind, wrote themselves into a corner, or realized that the Barbies couldn't be presented as antagonists. The idea is definitely not properly explored and a lot of it is I think this is what they were going for, but then you realize that a different scene condradicts it and so on. At the very least, if that was the message, it is lost on a vast majority of the movie's audience.",2023-07-22
"I definitely agree with this. Especially with the final scene where we're told the barrier between Barbie and human is practically non existent, and you can pretty much choose to be on either side at any time. I think both sides are the same, in the sense that the gender that is currently in power expresses sympathies for the other side, but continues to do nothing substantial to rectify the issue. The movie could have done a better job with highlighting the hypocrisy tho.",2023-07-22
Where does it show that though? Main barbie was the most empathetic to kens and she bailed on barbie land. What other female character in barbie land gave any indication that their long term goal is more equality?,2023-07-22
"If that is the intended message, why does no one (read the comments section here) see the Barbies as an antogonistic force? It's one thing to say that was what they intended when you look at in a vacuum versus how it is presented and perceived as a whole. It's such a good point that no one cares or they missed it. If this is the commentary, we should be leaving the movie disliking the Barbies (they are a reflection of the power-driven men in the real world), not how people are percieving it - like the Barbies getting one over on Kens for how women are treated in the real world (a world they don't actually know).",2023-07-22
"Kinda makes it a bit of a dark comedy ending no? If Ken's are an allegory for women in the real world, then it's either saying ""women are just as capable of perpetuating oppression when given the chance as men"" or ""those sexist men did the right thing in giving those feminists some breadcrumbs and delaying equality as much as possible"". Unless we're not meant to celebrate the ending?",2023-07-22
"I do also think it's done purposely but I also see that it doesn't work. So the Barbie's are vindictive? They are trying to get revenge - of you can have the same rights as women in the real world - a world they have never experienced. They are taking out their frustrations of a world they don't know on people they have known their whole lives and have liked. The movie solely works as a pushy commentary of our world and does not in the context of Barbie world. People are simply looking at scenes independently rather than how they fit into the whole. If this is some purposeful, powerful commentary of how people in power maintain it, then shouldn't the audience be leaving realizing that Barbies are a real antogonistic force - just like men in the real world, but if you read the comments here, 99% of people do not have any critiques of Barbies, somehow see their mistreatment of Kens as empowering or funny, or simply don't care. Not a real effective commentary if the vast majority of your audience missed it and are just completely okay with the inequality because the Barbies are doing it.",2023-07-22

"He‚Äôs not the primary antagonist. The expectation that patriarchal ideals put on both women and men was the antagonist. It may seem like Ken represents the patriarchy but he doesn't. Notice that Ken ALSO was figuring himself out.

I know it‚Äôs all very complicated to navigate - it is for me, too. Each year, I feel I learn women‚Äôs perspective a little more but I have more to go and I could never really know what it's like to be a woman.

You should use this as a movie to listen to versus one to fight. Don‚Äôt take America Ferrari‚Äôs speech as an attack but an opportunity to learn something about a perspective you don‚Äôt have constant access to because you don't have to live it.

Because the parallel is made, explicitly by Mirren‚Äôs narration, between the unfair experience of the Kens and the process women have been working through to achieve equality.

It ultimately wants to create this thought: You think the Kens situation is unfair? Yes it is. You think getting ‚Äúthe same amount of power women have in the real world‚Äù is unfair? Yes it is‚Äîand through the movie‚Äôs analogy a viewer can now recognize that by seeing Ken‚Äôs experience and stepping outside of their own biases about our world.

I didn't really see it that way. First of all she's in middle school, she probably had that anti-Barbie speech ready to go because she's had that discussion with her friends before and it connected to her sense as a person, not because she'd considered every angle ever and come to her final conclusion forever (middle schoolers tend not to have all info ever available to them). And she WAS in favor of leaving Robbie on the floor crying, she only said they should go back later when the ""reality"" of what was happening around her was sinking in. Changing your mind because you connected with a person or a situation is very human, not a plot hole.",2023-07-24
"It seems like people are projecting their ideologies onto the movie versus what is actually in the movie itself.


So, you're telling me that Ken and Barbie go into a world that has patriarchy, and instead of Ken going, oh this world has patriarchy so I might be able to win over Barbie here...he instead thinks, what if I leave Barbie, go back and establish patriarchy in my world (hopefully it works because Barbie's have 100% power there, and some of the Kens don't even like me), and hope that Barbie is fine and will find her way back, and when she's back, I will use patriarchy to win her over? 


If, as you said, the goal of young men and Ken, is to win over the girl, Ken had a lot better chance doing that in an already established patriarchy where they were alone.


As you said, Barbie wanted Ken to learn that he can be his own individual person and did not need to define himself by being with Barbie. However, as you said, the lesson is, ""there is no single definition of men,"" but just within a few minutes of that scene, America Farrera's character suggests and is lauded for her idea of an ""Average Barbie."" Once again, I don't think their heart was in the wrong place, but that definitely kind of goes against the message of embracing onself and not trying to fit into a mold. Reversing it and saying this doll reflects most of you is not any better than creating a doll that is marketed towards a certain demographic.",2023-07-22
">They were taught to define themselves by how good they can get a women.

Were they taught this or is this biology speaking? Do you really think the entire world ended up like this because they were taught this? If your assumption is correct then why did pretty much the entire world turn out this way. The world is pretty big. With a lot of different cultures - yet in pretty much all societies this rings true. Also men are not taught to define themselves by how good they can get women - men are taught to earn money and become successful first and foremost. And women will generally follow once that has been achieved.

>Ken thought he was nothing unless he could get Barbie.

Yea but Ken is not really reflective of how men in the real world really are - they are not obsessed with one woman only (in general).

>Do you think young men love the patriachy and showing themselves as alpha because they hate women? No! They think patriachy will help them get the girls.

Do you actually think young men outside of reddit actually know what patriarchy is? Do you even know what it is? Heck what does it even mean to be alpha. You can ask 10 different guys these questions and you'll get 10 different answers.

Also a lot of men don't hate or love patriarchy they just live in the society they were born trying to become as successful and happy as possible. Heck both men and women in real life (at least in first world countries that are very equal) do not spend their days thinking about this. What you see on internet is not always reflective of everyday life.

>The movie shows the problem young, misled men have as much as it show the women's side.

That's a lie. Yea it might touch on these problems a bit but without a doubt not *""as much as it show the women's side*.""

Throughout the movie Sophie is extremely unconfident in herself and her abilities. She goes to see Howl because the witch that placed a curse on her in the first place does so because Howl shows more interest in Sophie, than her. So in order to break her curse, Sophie goes to see Howl on her own accord. Sophie herself isn't super connected to her family, nor does she relate to them. Sophie is envious of her sisters perceived beauty, and her own mother rats Sophie out to the government, so I don't think she really feels like she belongs in her own family. Obviously, she loves them, but what is telling them she's cursed going to do?  Sophie by trying to understand howl and figure out a way to break her curse, as a result finds a new family that understands her. Sophie isn't going after an old man, Howl is her age and if you've seen the film, Howls first time meeting Sophie was when she was an adult, because she went back in time to warn Howl about the upcoming events, and to find her. 

Also sidenote, why do people demonise women for pursuing romantic relationships? Yes its different if shes a damsel in distress and sits there and cries for a man to love her, but Sophie isn't like that. Yes she wants to be attractive and find love, but what stops her is her own lack of confidence and agency. When all of her perceived social value is lost by becoming an old woman, she finally goes on a journey for herself, and without gaining the agency and confidence she wouldn't have broken her curse. If she stayed back and cried to her family about how ugly and worthless she was now, wouldn't she then be a distressed damsel? 

And this story isnt just Sophie fixing Howl, like some manic pixie dream girl. Howl helps Sophie become confident, as she helps Howl become brave and vulnerable. As Howl reaffirms to Sophie that she is beautiful, smart, and hands the wheel to her to get out off countless tough situations, and Sophie does the same for Howl, comforting him during his depressive episodes and adding structure into his chaotic life.

"Under no point in the movie was the matriarchy enforced at the end pictured as something bad / something that had to be stopped. Patriarchy was however correctly criticised throughout the movie.

I agree that the audience shouldn't think that manipulation is ok, but nowhere in the movie was it shown to be a wrong thing, as such it would be easier to reach that assumption, especially if it's presented as a way to fix a problem and reach a ""happy"" ending. I went back to the movie to see if an apology for this happens. I think Barbie does apologise, but because she took Ken for granted at the beginning of the movie, not because of the Barbies manipulative attitude. I was not able to find anywhere where this behaviour is shown to be bad / negative nor remember, but would be happy to be proven wrong",2023-08-22

">The barbies went back to having a matriarchy and called it a win with no self reflection that it was just as bad as what the Kens tried to do, laughing it off and giving them a few token positions. 

They explicitly say it‚Äôs a commentary on the role of women in modern society, the Kens ‚Äòwin‚Äô acceptance but it is caveated by ongoing social inequality. This isn‚Äôt even subtext, I‚Äôm pretty sure the narrator states this. The idea is if you find the ending unfair to Ken‚Äôs, then you should find real life unfair to women too.

>but it was never acknowledged that it puts pressures on Kens too 

Main Ken ends his arc by saying the pressures of the patriarchy were too much for him, and he wants to go back to his previous life.


>The writers could have done something with Allen feeling alienated by the expectation of masculinity but he was just laughed off and not allowed to leave

He played a pivotal role in the rebellion by working as a Barbie",2023-07-23
"""You need to find your own identities"" Actually, what they were trying to mean was, until that point of time Ken had gotten over with anything in the patriarchal world even though he didn't have an actual identity or an mba/doctor's license. Once he got out of the patriarchal world, he didn't have anything else left to feed his ego. Ego=identity. It means that, men can get over with many things in life without struggling much/exploring their identity because all patriarchical rules make it easy for them. Whereas, in the same patriarchical world, they soothe women by saying ""Find your identity, be yourself"" etc. So, this is a double referral, first to the men's ease in the patriarchical world and the second to how they numb women by saying abstract things. 

And I know life is hard for men also, and I acknowledge it and I'm not comparing it but for women life has multilayered of hardnesses.",2023-07-23

">The Barbies decided to give Kens all the power women had in the real world.

Which is wrong.  They gave them *less* power than women have in the real world.  The Ken's are 1 step above where they were before, but where they were before were literally not even people.  They still only exist under the attention of the Barbies and the **only** Barbie that learned the lesson that Kens are people too, immediately left to become a human.

>it's a reflection on how lots of women feel in the real world.

There are 4 women on the Supreme Court, and one has been on it for 40 years.  Barbieland is a shadow of the US, not Saudi Arabia.

>but he had this idea in his head that his purpose was to be her boyfriend 

*Because that's the entire concept of Barbie toys*.  Barbies in Barbieland embody how each toy was designed and how they are played with.

The movie had a solid message, and then plowed it under as it went on and mixed itself up entirely. ""Barbies are a reflection of how they are played with and what they were made to be, but they are also exactly the same as normal people and its ridiculous that Kens reflect how they are designed to be""",2023-07-30
"The thing about giving Kens as much power as women have in real world was kinda too much indulgence in the victim mentality in my opinion. 





Yes, it depends a lot on the area you're speaking of, but the matter of the fact is, women have a lot more power than they used to have. Some of the most influential people in the past 50 years were women: Angela Merkel, Theressa May (she's influential, let's not discuss how much good she did, ok? Don't open that rabbit hole), Sanna Mirella, Maia Sandu, the list goes on. On top of women judges, women having a higher college graduation rate than men. 




Do we have a long way to go towards gender equality? Yes, obviously, but I think we've reached that point where we need to open the discussion on male empowerment as well, such as mental health issues, suicide, toxic masculinity's effect on men, men's health in general and gender roles. The same way there is pressure for women to be mothers, there's pressure for men to be providers. God forbid you want to be a stay at home dad, people will have your balls on the chopping board.  





Now I'm not saying the movie couldn't get the message across, but the Ken's were the worst outlet for that. Let's not forget that Beach Ken adopted patriarchy because it was the first system that showed him basic respect. Barbieland Kens were literally treated worse than dogs. Maybe a better message would have been ""Hey, our matriarchy was equally as bad as your patriarchy. Perhaps it's time we gave you representation in the parliament and we work as equals?""",2023-07-30
"Regarding the friendzonr thing, it's not that he had the idea in his head that he had to be a boyfriend. The barbies knew that all too well. The best evidence for this is the guitar campfire scene. The barbies knew exactly how much they meant to the kens, which is why their fucked up plan worked. Since ken didn't have talk with barbie about how much he loves her before that, this implies that barbie, all the barbies, knew all this time. It's just that you know they willingly chose to ignore their feelings. 

And the regarding the ""they gave the kens all the power women have in the real world"", yeah I actually agree with that, that checks out. But it doesn't have to be that way no? The barbies got a reallllyyy good taste of what they put the kens through when they established ken land. Even after knowing what they had been putting the kens through ever since they existed, they still chose to let everything go back to normal. For me that was the point that the movie took it a bit too far with the message.",2023-07-31

It's making fun of the hardcore fandom who was determined to have WB release that version of the movie and having only that version count in continuity moving forward. Brainwashed writer Barbie had only one singular goal: to serve Ken. Nothing else mattered in her world. So the joke is both are super obsessed with just one thing.",2023-08-05
"It‚Äôs a 4 hour movie that WB was not fond of, it‚Äôs ironic because Barbie is a movie distributed by WB",2023-08-05
"yea I actually liked that the Barbies said ""nah, you can have like a little bit of rights/representation, but not that much"". I thought the implication was that they, too, were flawed beings, and it's not that MEN are bad, but that power corrupts and anyone in the better side of that kind of power imbalance isn't just going to give it all away.",2023-07-29
"Yeah but the problem with that is the real world men and patriarchy are portrayed as obviously bad and dumb while the Barbie Matriachy is competent and you‚Äôre meant to root for them to beat the Kens. So on the one hand you‚Äôve got the real world women portrayed sympathetically - meanwhile the Kens are portrayed less sympathetically than the group oppressing them.

Then there‚Äôs the end - Imagine a movie where a dumb woman is crying about how much she needs some dude while he ‚Äúmansplains‚Äù that she needs to find herself and that it‚Äôs ok to cry. And that‚Äôs the happy ending. Well that‚Äôs the ending of Barbie and people are somehow saying that‚Äôs a good ending for Ken and men? Lol, ok.

Also despite the message being that it‚Äôs ok for men to cry (because Kens crying), that moment is also clearly played for laughs, so it contradicts its own message. Men crying is ok? But also it‚Äôs hilariously funny?

I think Gerwig accidentally let A little too much of her own feelings into this and revealed she had a bit more contempt for men than she would ever admit. And that gets in the way of Barbie land mirroring the real world. I mean the Kens are dumb and the Barbies aren‚Äôt so there‚Äôs a justification for them ruling. Meanwhile in the real world the men are dumb and it‚Äôs the creative woman who can‚Äôt overcome the patriachy who should be in their position",2023-07-29
"I think that was also made clear by the fact that even after being ""deprogrammed"" all the Barbies except Margot were perfectly content to put Barbieland right back how it was. 

Most people are well aware of the inequalities we live under, but the vast majority of people with privilege do absolutely nothing to change the status quo unless it negatively affects them.",2023-07-30
Yes!,2023-07-30
"Except the Kens are portrayed as idiots and they don‚Äôt even really want power and were supposed to root for the Barbies to beat them, do actually the movie gives the Barbies a justification to rule - as Kens are incompetent anyway but the Barbies are smarter - meanwhile the real world women are sympathetically struggling against the patriachy (who are also idiots).

Imagine an ending of a movie where a woman is sobbing about loving a man (played for laughs) while he mansplains life to her and tells her she now gets to find herself. That‚Äôs the Barbie movie with Barbies message to Ken. The sexes reversed would be seen as incredibly sexist and condescending. It‚Äôs laughable women think of that as a positive scene for men. 

The problem wasn‚Äôt with the gender swap of Kens for the real world women - the problem was they were outraged so badly and stupidly (just like all the men) and when heygit in charge they were worse than it at the Barbies, so actually the movie justifies the Matriachy. If you wanted to have an effective portrayal of a gender role reversal you had to make the Barbies obvious villains like the real world men. As it is why shouldn‚Äôt they rule Barbie land? The Kens are idiots who will do the wrong thing.

So in reality the movie sends the message that women should be in charge because men are morons. But hey once women are in charge men will get to cry and find themselves or whatever feminist women think they want to do.",2023-07-30

in my specific career, rising through the ranks is not something i need to worry about. but for women who have aspirations of becoming CXOs or partners or department heads, then they would def feel this pressure bc only one specific type of woman tends to achieve that. women who are firm but not bossy, who know how to gently speak their mind while still knowing their place, who can stand up to men but never above them, who must find time to be the primary caregiver while breaking their backs at work to stand out

But one thing can be metaphor for many things at the same time, depending on scene and context.

Ken also subtly represent issue that both men and women have, thinking that they are defined by acceptance from the opposite sex.

Then Ken found patriarchy, and he thinks this is his way of solving the problem. But he is over-correcting. His idea is nothing but a gender swap. So at this point he also represent young men in real world who fall into alpha/patriarchy pipeline who thinks being alpha will get him women. Ken still do all those patriarchy take over because he wants Barbie to love him.

Not only that, but I've read many more impressions from people who grew up playing with Barbies who felt exactly the same way about Ken as the movie portrays him. Like, how do you miss such blatant subtext even if it's not how you grew up playing with Barbies? And then *the entire message* of being a whole person without needing a romantic partner for fulfillment seems to have gone entirely over your head.

That's on you, feminism didn't do it to you.",2023-07-22

"I think it will wear off after the initial hype. To me it doesn't have much rewatch value. If the movie was as funny and lighthearted as the first half I could see myself rewatching it for cute girls' nights. But as a whole it drags in the middle and I wouldn't watch it in full too often. 

Again it wasn't terrible but it just felt like a meh movie. I had parts that I loved like Barbie's getting ready scenes and when things started getting wonky, Ken's everything lol, but the movie could have flowed better.",2023-07-25
"I don't think that came across at all... We don't know really what she does to be so stressed or why she feels inadequate outside of the general insecurities of a person. I think thats a lot to derive from what we are actually given. I think Barbie's arc has a resolution but not America's because I feel like she didn't really have an arc. She was depressed and anxious. That was chalked up to being weird and dark. And nothing was really done about it. She just continued doing what she was doing. I guess she got to vent out her frustrations to the barbies in barbieworld. But I don't see her speech as much of a character arc.

I didn't hate her character I was just sad that it felt like the writers half-assed her backstory

Edit: I feel like the speech would be more impactful if it was given by Barbie after living in the real world because we are following her journey. America's character I didn't really resonate with",2023-07-25

It has a lot of commentary obviously, but it never takes itself too seriously, with the exception maybe of the very end, but that was short enough I allowed it.

"status quo, baby

Again, it's very odd because of the subtext over women's health, Barbie ending the movie going to a gynecologist and all. I would have preferred a movie where Barbie's fish out of water story is the focus. I found myself thinking that her visit to the doctor would have made for great comedy and pathos, that what follows would be far more revealing‚Äîand potentially subversive‚Äîthan this dull Ken storyline, especially in the context of SCOTUS overturning *Roe*, thanks in part to Amy Coney Barrett. There would be little need for those terrible speeches because the themes would have more room to be communicated visually

The script is odd because it's written for adults at the level of children.

">radically feminist piece of propaganda.

The movie literally made fun of radical feminism.

Barbieland in the beginning is basically a glorified radical feminist society where women rule the world and the men are just there to be ""playthings"" for the women. The movie compared this to the patriachal society of the real world.

The ending of the movie had this societal structure be taken down. The Kens are given a position in President Barbie's cabinet, and are encouraged to be themselves beyond being their respective Barbie's boyfriends.

"- lower ranking Mattel guy: He's portrayed as unimportant and relatively meek

- Alan: Alan the orbiter? He's the guy that nobody respects or even remembers. 

- Ken: OK so even without knowing which Ken you're talking about, they all seem to lean into their flaws at one point or another. 

- CEO: Oh come on. The CEO is the most over-the-top of them all in terms of flaws. His line about Normal Barbie or whatever was something like ""This is a horrible idea"" then switches to ""This is a great idea"" when his lackey says it'll make them money. Greta could not have been more on-the-nose with this one if she'd named Will's character President Business. He is a man who has no conviction beyond the drive for money. 

The closest we get to a decent man is Duolingo Dad, and he's more innocuous than good, and one could argue that he's still not really all that aware of the world around him. 

But here's the rub: I don't think that the fact that every man in the film is basically a collection of character flaws is a ""bad thing"" or meant to be nothing more than a round of vacuous man-hating. 

This pattern lays into the exploration of the experience of being a woman...which is what the whole thing is about anyhow.

I think it's a great movie with a lot to say. The fact that there really *isn't* a ""good male character"" is part of that statement. How does it feel to exist as a woman in the real world?",2023-07-21

You know how men like Andrew Tate, will say they want patriarchy for the money, babes, sex, power, ect? outside of the few that are psychopaths, they are just boys who want connection and love, yet cling to patriarchy thinking it will give them that, instead of seeking to be see and be seen.

How many boys get frustrated about not finding a girlfriend, and when a Andrew Tate or Jordan Peterson comes along, then suddenly click. ""I can make this system work for me"".",2023-07-21
Even those characters were portrayed as weak and fumbling idiots. Alan was a wimp. CEO was greedy and money driven. Accurate? Sure to an extent.

This is some heavy Mattel coolaid you're drinking. Barbie came out as a product to capitalize on little girls wanting to play with dolls, and not wanting to play with other toys that were never gendered to begin with. Women were doctors long before ""Dr. Barbie"" was a thing. Women were working jobs long before Mattel capitalized on those professions to market a toy. The only reason Mattel even picked those professions is because they were already popular or high profile enough with women at the time. There's a reason why ""garbage collector barbie"" or ""brick layer barbie"" aren't really a thing. There's a reason why ""software engineer"" barbie didn't come out until the idea of becoming software engineers became popular with women.",2023-07-22

That annoyed me, because ""Every Day"" Barbie *is* a stupid idea. It would be like having 'Office Man' action figures or 'Do your homework!' games.  The point of toys, including Barbie, is to stoke the imagination of the child. Little girls don't *want to* play with just normal, boring person doll, and the only reason America's character suggested that was due to her own insecurities about being a normal, boring adult instead of a literal Barbie doll, which is stupid.

Also, if 'Every Day' Barbie really did make so much money compared to surfing Barbie or astronaut Barbie or Barbie with a really nice car, Mattel would have already been mass producing them IRL.

Ken, seeing how they brainwashed Barbie‚Äôs just to get them to respect kens as people, realizes that they just made Barbies into kens ( accessories).

 Well, it showed that the man running Mattel (Will Ferrell) was more a result of the patriarchal system than an active participant. When he realises what Ken has done, he tries to make things right because he believes in the original intent of Barbie, making little girls happy. 

Then there's the Ken's, who are shown to be treated as second-class citizens in Barbie World, and they exist solely to supplement the Barbie's and vye for their attention and approval. Once a Ken gets into the real world, he starts to cotton on to the reversal at play between the genders. Someone walks up to him and asks him for the time. For the first time in his existence, he feels valued and useful. So he chases more of that.

 The movie is as much about Ken finding out who he is and where he fits as it is about Barbie finding herself as well, and is a necessary hurdle for her and the other Barbies to overcome. He goes way overboard with a less-than-basic understanding of patriarchy, and the Kens as a whole  but the film ends with them making up and the Ken's being granted more of a role in their society after being shown the error of their ways. So, at the end, both sides walk away with a clearer understanding of themselves and of each other and work out a compromise to start making progress to true equality in their world.

As a 31 year old man who heavily subscribed to the toxic masculinity mindset through my early 20s, I found myself relating to the internal struggles of the Kens quite a bit while laughing along at how stupid and goofy they were. Yeah, it was exaggerated and played for laughs, and it definitely should be. The way men can react when we feel emasculated and cop hits to the ego can be utterly ridiculous and often disproportionate, yet I never once felt like the movie was being mean-spirited or unfair. It was ridiculing dated yet current societal norms in an over-the-top way, and a lot of it landed for me. 

The movie goes out of its way to point out that the Kens' position in their society was not ideal for them and fell on deaf ears. It didn't use it as the sole excuse for conflict in the movie. Rather, it showed that people who aren't comfortable within themselves can latch onto someone in their lives and depend on that person to fill the void, so to speak. When their expectations aren't met (unrealistic or unfair as they may be), that can breed bitterness, and push backs will happen in ome form or another.

TLDR: I thought the movie was really clever and insightful, and I didn't ever really find it to be punching down. It's a goofy comedy movie, and it has a very clear message about insecurity and identity on both sides of the coin. I enjoyed it.",2023-07-26

But still, even that blatant misandry felt like it was disorganized and inconsistent.

Barbie obviously wasn't mean to be dystopian. It was basically supposed to be heaven for women. The women have great boundaries, ample opportunity.

Why have the kens take over, just to have the Barbies take back over and have society remain essentially the same, except now barbies have all the power? Is power just changing hands from one gender to the other? What is the message they are trying to communicate? That entire arc felt somewhat pointless to me.

"That‚Äôs the point with Ken, though. This film purposely and satirically switches gender roles in Barbieland to point out the ridiculous and problematic character archetypes that were traditionally available to women in the real world. Essentially, with this gender swap they make Kens into the bimbo role that women are cast in, in the real world.   


Marilyn Monroe is a classic example of this. Early in her acting career, her studio typecasted her into the dumb blonde role. Despite her desire to break into serious acting, studios refused to cast her in any other role but the dumb blonde. Women traditionally have limited roles in film- and often times their characters only exist to support or push the story of the male protagonist. There‚Äôs notable exceptions to this of course, but this has been a problematic part of Hollywood‚Äôs history.

[https://sunwooj.github.io/documents/jeong-2017-iconicity-preprint.pdf](https://sunwooj.github.io/documents/jeong-2017-iconicity-preprint.pdf)  


So, the point of the Kens in this film isn‚Äôt to act like some grand statement that men are idiots.  The point of casting men in the classic one-dimension, pretty accessory to the protagonist ‚Äúbimbo‚Äù role- a role portrayed by women in the real world- is to highlight the absolute ridiculousness and absurdity of the existence of these traditional female character archetypes in film. 

If seeing men cast in this role makes you feel angered, or like men are being improperly and insultingly portrayed on the big screen- it‚Äôs supposed to make you feel that way.   


Stop and think about the countless movies where female characters are simply plot devices, used to create sex appeal for male audiences or are simply cast as dumb and/or mean blondes. Then ask yourself- why is our society comfortable, even entertained by seeing women in those roles... but when it‚Äôs men reduced to this role, suddenly it‚Äôs uncomfortable  and angering to watch? The Kens directly challenge the audience‚Äôs expectation of gender roles in film, as a way to push viewers to question their own biases and expectations. The point is that these types of roles are ridiculous and insulting to all genders. Since it‚Äôs normalized to cast women in this role, people won‚Äôt blink an eye. So the point of  casting men as these over-the-top, absurd gang of idiots is to bring attention to this ridiculousness in a way the audience can‚Äôt ignore.",2023-07-26

Progress isn‚Äôt some sort of instantaneous thing. It will take time for kens to gain rights and power in barbieland, just like it took time for women to gain rights and power in the real world.


In my opinion it would‚Äôve been super corny and eye roll inducing for the Barbie‚Äôs to automatically give the kens complete equality after they realized the error of their ways. It also would‚Äôve implied that the matriarchy in barbieland was somehow more fair and just than the patriarchy in the real world.",2023-07-23
Yes exactly!! That part at the end ruined it for me I was already checked out once they went back to Barbie land but by then I was like by god this movie wasn‚Äôt very good,2023-07-23
It‚Äôs not ironic. Kens suffering in a matriarchal society and his suffering represents women in the patriarchy. Just flipped genders,2023-07-23
"Second this massively - wanna add as well to the people annoyed/confused on why only Barbie apologizes to Ken at the end and feeling like he got more character development, that is because Kens experience is supposed to reflect womens experience in the real world, his journey of feeling like just an accessory and lost on who they are under a matriarchy is supposed to reflect womens experience under the real world patriarchy. Will say I would‚Äôve enjoyed more attention on the real world family too, however all I would change there is making the film longer lol",2023-07-24
No. I understand that at the time of inception that was the prevailing issue and therefore Barbie taught little girls that they could be anything which was incredibly important and cutting edge at the time. But we are in a different place now in the world as women. Where the new expectation is that we have careers OR we stay at home but not both. There is immense pressure on women in corprate American to not take time off for motherhood and when we do we are penalized for it. I would have like to have seen Mattel keep up with the new issues that women face and to have updated Barbie over the years to be aligned with the issues modern girls/ women face.,2023-08-02

"No, I'm quite serious. I actually initially thought that the backlash it had gotten with male/guy viewers when it was theatres must have been overblown. And to a degree it was - but having said that; holy fuck is this movie a blatant ham fisted attempt at throwing the population of guys under the bus.

I love the scene where Barbie goes to the real world and approaches the construction workers (who are all guys) and she immediately starts getting sexualized with derogatory remarks. Like, what in the actual fuck? Just with that scene alone there are so many things that are wrong.

For one; that DOESN'T FUCKING happen in the real world. Yeah sure, if your Margot Robbie in tight fitting cowboy outfit - guys will stare, but sexual verbal remarks right away, immediately when she starts a conversation? What? And that scene wasn't filmed for humor, none of the dialogue was quirky or intended for a laugh. So one can safely and obviously come to the conclusion that Greta Gerwig was trying to say something with that scene...

Secondly; there's absolutely nothing keeping from girls being construction workers in the real world versus Barbie world. Absolutely. Nothing. Women are perfectly within their right to apply for construction positions. But they don't. It's not because of a ""patriarchy"" - it's because, well, they just don't apply for those hard labor jobs. Gosh gee golly, who could have possibly thought that would be the cause.

I stand by what I said; this movie is in no way shape or form meant to be funny - Greta Gerwig knew exactly what she was doing and took every single gullible girl (or guy) for a ride.

Since when was Barbie an icon for female empowerment and feminism anyway? It wasn't. But the movie sure as hell fooled people into thinking it was.",2023-11-06
"Or maybe the Kens were underdeveloped because real-life Ken dolls actually were just accessories for the female Barbie dolls. Maybe it‚Äôs a joke about a toy in a movie about a toy that she just slapped some broad feminist ideas onto. 

The concept of a Ken doll finding out that men in the real world aren‚Äôt just accessories for women then getting very into horses and pool tables in genuinely funny because it‚Äôs a *joke about a toy*. Calm down",2023-07-25
"Well Mr. ‚ÄúNutSackForDayzzzz‚Äù, Barbie also didn‚Äôt use the stairs, actually have things to eat/drink, etc. because that‚Äôs not how little girls play with Barbie in the real world. It‚Äôs not a stretch to say the Kens are underdeveloped because boys have been told not to play with dolls in the real world. 

Seeing the deeper meaning means also confronting the patriarchy in our own society and that can be incredibly daunting for some people. 

It‚Äôs also interesting that when Ken gets back from the real world, he takes over the dream house and ‚ÄúKenergizes‚Äù everything with the patriarchy in an incredibly ridiculous way. I‚Äôm sure a lot of little girls can relate to a brother or cousin taking over their dollhouse with cars or toy horses or trains when they play.

"The whole bit at the end with Ken being ‚Äúhelped‚Äù by Barbie is defiantly a radical feminist talking point about how patriachy hurts men too. Trouble is that only resonates with radical feminists as actually 95% of men don‚Äôt actually want to cry more or find themselves whatever that means according to feminists - it‚Äôs really just a fantasy of feminist women that they like to project on men but is very far from reality.

That is when they get attacked, when they take their opinion and hold it up as law.  It‚Äôs fine if someone didn‚Äôt like the movie, or that they thought it was heavy handed (it blatantly is) but I felt the movie had fun with how obvious it‚Äôs message was. Almost all the jokes landed for me, a white male, and some of them rang so painfully true I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. Everyone in my theater, which was packed, looked like they were having a blast.

I think the Mattel Executives were meant to be funny. They cast Will Ferrell as the leader!  The jokes about them failing to jump the turnstile, and rollerblading, were silly but not funny.

Your point would make more sense if the Barbie president decided Kens could have an equal say and find their own identity, maybe have their own ""Kendom"" where they can build their Mega Dojo Casas, but instead she won't even let them have a small position of power like a supreme court seat. Kind of goes against the message of both having their own identity if one is still clearly the ruling class.

After all, the Kens just wanted to enjoy their horses and ""manly"" hobbies, and of course they went too far when they first got a taste of that freedom. But then the Barbies response was just to completely take everything away rather than compromise. The message of ""well you can just be Ken"" is kind of hollow if Ken still has to do everything the Barbies want in a society dominated by them.",2023-07-23

"If this movie came out in the 50‚Äôs it woulda been entirely controversial but probably would‚Äôve been one of the greatest movies retrospectively ever by actually tackling a problem‚Ä¶ but we are 70 years past that point.

Again tho, if this was 70 years ago or in modern day Syria the movie woulda got people killed but it woulda been a fantastic maybe timeless piece.

"I see what you mean, but I didn‚Äôt personally take it that way. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what they were trying to say since like you said it felt so out place for something like that to be in the movie about how women can achieve anything. 

I felt it was more of how mothers can be grounding points for children and how everything in a person‚Äôs life constantly grows and changes, but mothers act as a sort of lighthouse in our lives. ‚ÄúStaying still‚Äù to me was more in the sense of they aren‚Äôt leaving your side through it all, and they are the constant that you can always go to.",2023-07-21
"My interpretation was as it relates to parenthood and maybe a parent‚Äôs tendency to resent their kids getting older and moving on. We see this when the daughter is shown taking her old toys to Goodwill and the mom saves the Barbie doll as if she‚Äôs trying to hold on to the memories of her daughter as a young child rather than the young adult that she‚Äôs becoming. 

So in the same way, Ruth created Barbie as a way to give girls another aspiration other than just giving them baby dolls and saying ‚Äúhere, you have to be a mom‚Äù. But she also knows that Barbies themselves have also grown beyond their original purpose.",2023-07-21
"It also occured to me that, throughout the movie, others alluded to the fact that the weird things happening to Barbie were caused both by Barbie herself _and_ her human. When anyone said this, Barbie always vehemently denied that she had any part in it because she didn't want _anything_ to change. 

The idea that it takes two to tango makes sense, because if a little girl owning a Barbie and being sad caused this, it would be WAY more common. 

I feel that Barbie always wanted to see beyond her own repetitive picture-perfect world, deep down. I know Barbies don't have complex emotions etc but maybe being the stereotypical Barbie and not having a career to occupy her mind/time could cause this?",2023-07-24

Theres often a pay gap, between men and women still. But ive never seen anyone not get hired for being a woman. In my 1st job in retail, 20 years ago i saw a woman hired over a guy with more experiance, and 10 years ago something similar in another field that was more egregious in terms of experience. And almost anytime a woman was matched vs men applying it went to women. I am legit starting to agree with people who say women have barriers in their own minds, because iirc i havent seen them. A lot of the disparity is of course because women are relatively new to many fields, and absolutely *not* welcome a few decades ago. And because of that the girls growing up then didnt dream or were told not to dream of doing x when they were older. But women have been scientists, astronauts, world leaders and whatever else they *want* to be for 3 decades+ now. I have seen 2 examples of poc not being hired at 2 different places i worked, but both were men. So that needs work. Paygap needs work. But women can do anyjob they want in the g20 world.

Additionally it was already well established by this point in the movie that being treated as less than feels bad for both Barbies and Kens so the Barbie‚Äôs make their decision knowing full well what it entails.

I wonder how women would take it if some innocuous wife character was mocked for learning a language by her son and husband and then her husband laughed about some cooler old girlfriend he had. Would they root for the character mocking her or recognize the obvious disrespect of all that. And yet here it‚Äôs written for laughs and Gloria is played as the sympathetic hero.

"> men are treated like women are treated in movies made by and for men (read, one-dimensional supporting characters that further the male leads).

Eh. That's not really what's going on here though. There are absolutely films where female side characters serve more as plot devices for male main characters. However, here, it's more that every male character is just there for comic relief/to present negative and demeaning aspects of men. In this movie, there isn't a single male character who isn't an idiot. They are universally treated as buffoons who are, at best, harmless, and at worst, malicious. I would say the most positively represented male character was America Fererra's husband, who has like... 3 lines, all in clumsy Spanish, because the joke is that he's learning Spanish, and then his own daughter says that he's being culturally appropriative, but I don't speak Spanish, so I'm not really sure what the joke was there. 

Anyway, the point is there is a difference between having simple and underdeveloped supporting characters, and basing every character of a certain gender as an idiot. They're not even one-dimensional, they're literally just universally dumb, while the female characters are universally intelligent. It's the difference between every woman in a movie seeming more like a prop to further the story of the brooding male lead (e.g: every Christopher Nolan movie) and those women all explicitly being bimbos or seductresses, regardless of who they are.

> Making barbieland a happy go lucky egalitarian society at the end would do injustice to the commentary because barbieland is supposed to be a mirror image of the real world not a utopian society.

The issue with this is that Barbieland *isn't* a mirror of the real world at all. You could argue that it is a heavily distorted satire of real world politics, but it has very little representation of the actual, modern real world. Case in point, they make a big deal about the Kens not getting representation in the Supreme Court. In real life, 4 of the 9 Justices are women. In the end, it just comes off as the Barbie's being petty and spiteful and actively abusing the Kens, and they're meant to be the protagonists here. It makes it hard to care about the whole 'Kens brainwashing Barbies' plot when said Barbies were more than happy to oppress the Kens both before and after the revolution. I mean, it's even mentioned in the film that Barbies get houses and Kens just... don't. 

It's one thing to not immediately create some magical social utopia, but it seems like the Kens just went back to being oppressed by the Barbies in the end, and we're supposed to celebrate that with a quip about how i's better than feminists got half a century ago. It comes across as just an unpleasant and petty note to end on.

A lot of the commentary on men in the film comes across like that. Just... unpleasant and petty and a little mean-spirited. The whole montage of them saving the Barbies, by preying on traditionally masculine activities like:

* Expressing your enjoyment of a movie 

* Helping someone who has explicitly asked for help with tech problems

* Sports

It just comes across as unnecesarily cruel. Maybe it's because I enjoy some of these activities myself and don't like seeing them made fun of and expressed as a negative, but it added to my general distaste of that part. It feels like they took pretty positive traits (being enthusiastic about a hobby, being helpful to others, group activities and improvement) and twisted them to manipulate and trick people, particularly when this part of the story was interspersed with America Fererra monologuing about how hard it is to be a woman.

"I'm not going to argue that what the Kens did was right. My point is that the Barbies did essentially the same thing as the Kens and yet were celebrated for it. In the beginning of the movie the Kens were brainwashed and subservient, but somehow it's ok because it was the Barbies doing it? It's only wrong when the Kens do it? 

Imagine if the roles of Ken and Barbie were switched but otherwise the movie remained the same. The Kens made Kenland and the Barbies just live in it. Then the Barbies read some opinion pieces and see a world where women rules and decide that they should be in charge of Kenland, and they tell the Kens to be their servants (and the Kens agree because... no immunity... or something). Would you argue that the Kens should be able to take back Kenland by emotionally manipulating the Barbies because the Barbies brainwashed them and stole Kenland? And after succeeding in taking back Kenland, the Kens should be celebrated and Barbies only be given non-important jobs? Your argument was that the reactions of one group were justified because of the prior actions of the other group: if you can't find yourself agreeing as strongly with the actions of the Kens in the switched scenario as you do with the original Barbie scenario, then you have a bias that is impacting your judgement.

The message should be that treating either gender as lesser than the other is wrong, and that two wrongs don't make a right. The solution to our society is not to reverse the roles. That's just trading one flavor of injustice for another.",2023-07-23

This is literally what causes men to be more aggressive once this happens to them. They open up and are vulnerable and the girl they're with exploits it and uses them as a filler til they find someone they actually want. Meanwhile Ken is blinded by his love. 

It's just a dumb Barbie movie. Really there's no reason to waste time analyzing it. It had funny moments, but a pointless story. It was purely character driven.

2. While the movie did portray Kenland as bad and chaotic, they acknowledge towards the end that this all happend because of the unrealistic standards for men/Kens; meaning that they should just be boyfriends to their Barbies and nothing else. Barbie encourages the Kens to find their own passions without just being an accessoire to Barbie and also mentions that they are open to a mixed supreme court and more Kens in higher positions - but only if they proof that they are trustworthy which makes sense to me after the whole Ken War.

To talk about the ‚Äúmen‚Äù theme people keep spitting out, others are saying the whole Ken sequence was him discovering in an ironic way that men in Barbieland don‚Äôt have to just be dumb himbos meant to swoon all the Barbies - almost like how girls in the real world used Barbie to see how they don‚Äôt have to be just mothers and trophies for men. There‚Äôs no actual ‚Äúmisandry‚Äù involved in conveying this, it‚Äôs quite literally just a genderbent story of equal rights that ends with everyone deciding they should live their lives freely of how they were initially designed.

But the Ken's initial solution to this problem is to embrace the patriarchy and implement it in Barbieland. The result is a lot of outward improvements for the Kens, but on a deeper level they're still unhappy, because patriarchy is restrictive for men.

The point being that the patriarchy offers simple but often harmful solutions to men because it limits self expression to the box of traditional masculinity. Greta wanted to explore the impacts of the patriarchy on both men and women, which is why Ken gets so much screentime",2023-07-27
Im not saying it isn‚Äôt fascinating. What I am saying is this movie is one giant contradiction. The fact it‚Äôs affecting men so much isn‚Äôt at all surprising.

I see many of the things she was talking about a woman‚Äôs experience mirrored in a man‚Äôs experience (and I‚Äôm not alone, Gerwig herself identified it ‚ÄúThe men are crying, too, because they have their own speech they feel they can‚Äôt ever give, you know? And they have their twin tightrope, which is also painful. There‚Äôs something about some of these structures that are just, you know, ‚ÄòSomebody make me stop!‚Äô That‚Äôs sort of, I suppose, the feeling behind Ken.‚Äù)



A bit you‚Äôve said ‚Äòthe patriarchy created by men‚Äô- do you think men have done this on purpose? Like they got together like a board meeting and did this?‚Äîit‚Äôs like class structure or racism or whatever- it happened naturally through thousands of years of society, social norms etc once again it 100% needs to change so that both sexes are equal and people feel less societal pressure to act or be a certain way-100% on board with that‚Äî-it‚Äôs just not done as some nefarious plot, it‚Äôs a confluence of thousands of years of cultural expectations which effect both men and women negatively (like toxic masculinity is a behaviour which is most commonly shown by men‚Ä¶and negatively effects men and women‚Ä¶but can also be shown by women e.g. telling little boys not to cry)‚Äî-misogyny is the same issue men show it but so do women (hence the whole mention in the movie of ‚Äòwomen hating women‚Äô‚Ä¶or even Sasha‚Äôs thing about why she hates Barbie, the representation Barbie shows has been identified as misogyny due to the unrealistic expectations‚Ä¶.but hating on people who like the ultra feminine astethic is also misogyny because it‚Äôs saying they‚Äôre ‚Äòbad‚Äô women for who they feel they are)- from feminist Helen Lewis ""long tradition of regulating female behaviour by defining women in opposition to one another"" as the architecture of misogyny

It might be coming from a psychology background rather than a sociology background but I tend to see the postmodernism viewpoint (and postmodern feminism) that meta narratives don‚Äôt successfully explain the issues  (saying ‚Äòthe patriarchy does this‚Äô isn‚Äôt sufficient, we need to look at the mechanisms like gender norms, conditioning etc done by everyone if we‚Äôre wanting to change things)- I always see men and women as more similar than they are different‚Ä¶but aware I‚Äôm from a certain intersectional perspective of white working class Britain where the stereotypes and roles of men and women are different to those in other countries

"What does that even mean though? The patriarchy in the real world was bad so it‚Äôs alright for Barbie land to be a matriarchy? And if Ken is womens stand in in Barbie land as the opressed class then why are the Barbies portrayed positively at the beginning and the mens patriarchy in the real world so negatively?

"It‚Äôs all good, brutha. We just gotta claim our shit and run with it. 

The movie REALLY wants to make Kens out to be a bunch of morons, but:

- Their products sold the most
- They only ever wanted to help the Barbies while the Barbies just shat over the Kens every time
- Even at the end of everything, they were fine with taking the least if it meant the Barbies were happy
- **All** the Kens were buff and good looking, whereas you had differing levels of health and beauty with the Barbies
- The Kens were the most emotionally complex and relatable, lamenting their lot in life while striking out against the Barbies yet feeling conflicted about it. The Barbies had ZERO qualms about going against the Kens, but the Kens were devastated by the situation
- The Kens were able to establish their own government within the span of a day or less AND got the Barbies to agree to it. Given that they could not reasonably have comprehended the real world stuff, they would have to have agreed with what the Kens were putting down and found it enjoyable.

And so much more. We‚Äôre Kenough, brutha.",2023-07-24
"The movie straight up ends with the Kens asking if they could have ONE Ken on the Supreme Court and President Barbie says, ‚Äúno, but you can have a lower court position like a district court‚Äù, and the Kens get super excited about that only for the narrator to then say, ‚Äúone day, the Kens will have as much power as women have these days.‚Äù

What you‚Äôre saying is absolute cope. This movie outright  hated the Kens. When Barbie doesn‚Äôt even know where the Kens live and the Kens get emotionally animated about being shown ‚Äúrespect‚Äù by being given something as mundane as a question on the time, it is abundantly clear that the Kens were not equals to the Barbies. As for your point that they are more individualistic, they really aren‚Äôt. Yeah, you have the ‚ÄúI am Kenough‚Äù stuff at the end, but it was still abundantly clear that the Kens wanted to be near the Barbies and the Barbies loathed the Kens, so really it was back to the status quo.",2023-07-22

"There is gender war everyday. It would be disingenous for the movie not to address that, and so it does it by contrasting real world with Barbieland*. I agree that the movie doesn't do anything significant to address beauty ideals and body issues (and even jokes around that casting Margot as Barbie doesn't do it any favors on that issue xD).
As for women's rights and Mattel, of course the bottom line of any company (and also this movie) is money. The movie also says this several times. But Barbie has had several impacts in how women and especially girls view themselves and their futures. The opening sequence starts by making this point very clear. Now, we can discuss what kind of impacts those are (positive, negative, confirming gender roles, refusing gender roles, etc), but we can't deny that they exist.
Even if it is all fake, at the end of the day Mattel sells dreams (mostly to) girls. And what girl doesn't dream of equal rights and opportunities? Companies have their share of influence on politics and the changing of mentalities even if they just want your money.

"How was Oppenheimer at all thought provoking?  It was a run of the mill history lesson, on a subject most people are probably pretty familiar with.  Maybe being from New Mexico, I'm a little more familiar than the average movie goer, but like, yeah he made an atomic bomb.  We all know that.  And it's not like the debate of the ethics of its use hasn't been debated for decades.  It's very much a ""I'm 12 and what if the atomic bomb is actually dangerous for humanity?"" kind of movie.  That's not to say it's a bad movie.  It was very well done and engaging throughout.  But the ideas presented were nothing new, and ultimately it shies away from taking a real stance on the issue either way going with more of a vague, ""Well what do you, Mr. Audience, think?  Was blowing up civilians a good thing?""  

Meanwhile, Barbie was an absolute brilliant dissection of our modern patriarchy.  So much of the criticisms were totally on point: mansplaining The Godfather to women, toxic masculinity regressing to a childlike fascination with playing cowboys, the double edge sword nature of Barbie as a female role model. 

In the end you kind of want the Kens to lose, I think, but then that's sort of the point too.  Them losing is what made them into reactionary incels who turned into complete misogynists as soon as they got the chance, and the idea isn't that women should be in charge or that men should be in charge, because both systems had clear and obvious victims, even if they were victimized in different ways.  Plus it greatly explored the harmful effects on men that patriarchy has, which is often ignored in popular feminist discussion.

Like if we're talking about filmmaking, there's probably a lot more going on in the Nolan movie.  From the use of black and white, to the use of sound during the Trinity test, to the framing device and reveal around the Einstein conversation....but if we're to talk about ideas, which is what I'm talking about here when I say ""thought provoking"", Barbie is far more ripe for discussion.  Oppenheimer did not have a lot to say, and was a very shallow look at an obvious and well-documented conversation that's been going on for nearly 100 years, but Barbie had a lot to say with particularly modern takes on real problems of our time which we're all experiencing on a daily basis.

Like sure, maybe nuclear bombs will still destroy all of civilization, but even that would be a natural extension of the patriarchal imagination suggested by the Barbie film.  What is Oppenheimer but a bunch of Kens playing with toy soldiers and fireworks?",2023-07-23

"I was coming into the movie expecting a lot of male-bashing and was pleasantly surprised at how much character they give the male characters by the end. For a women-centered movie about female empowerment, they did a pretty good job at giving Ken a pretty reasonable explanation for a lot of his actions. I really came to sympathize with him by the end, dude just wanted to be in the dream house with barbie. The other men don't get quite as much character development, but most of barbieland seems to be this hivemind of exaggerated stereotypes anyways (see: the women instantly becoming submissive to the men when taught about the patriarchy).

The part where all the Barbies get un-brainwashed seems to be more of a jab at how society treats women as a whole, rather than specifically bashing men for how they treat women (though it is sort of implied that men perpetuate a lot of these issues)",2023-07-21

"I think you‚Äôre reading too much into it. Yes there was a theme of role reversal obviously with the Kens and real world women, but I seriously doubt Gerwig was thinking - ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show a man crying and give a ‚Äúfeminist message‚Äù that it‚Äôs alright for men to cry, but I‚Äôll also show it as a joke to make people aware that one gender being shown as a joke is bad.‚Äù 

I mean who was she trying to show that their perception was unfair? Herself? Because she‚Äôs the one that choose to make the movie mocking those things for a comedic effect. I think it is far more likely she simply wasn‚Äôt aware of how contradictory her character writing is compared to the messages she‚Äôs promoting.
If she did have some super secret hidden meaning then it‚Äôs just bad writing if it isn‚Äôt clear.

If you want to make a movie saying it‚Äôs alright for men to cry and be themselves then don‚Äôt also show men as a joke when they do these things otherwise your point will be lost if not counterproductive. If you just want to make a movie and have fun at mens expense then ok - but don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôre helping them with an awesome message why you do so, to make it seem acceptable to a female audience.

It seems to me this movie was made largely to have fun at mens expense but with a purely performative message for women that the movie is also good for men to morally justify it. Whether Gerwig is cognisant of that is another thing.

But in all seriousness, if a super macho movie like Rambo starring a mens favourite action movie star like Stallone has already made the point that it‚Äôs alright for men to cry - way back in the 70‚Äôs, and made it without a hint of comedy and in no way played for laughs, just with a wholly good intent for men, then perhaps a scene telling men it‚Äôs alright to cry in the Barbie movie 40 years later as some supposedly new feminist message, all while making a little joke of a crying male character at the same time, isn‚Äôt the positive or new message either Gerwig or some of the fans of Barbie think it is. 
It‚Äôs just pass√© and condescendingly rude.

By all means have fun at mens expense - but don‚Äôt tell them it‚Äôs good for them as you do it. That‚Äôs the part I have issues with.",2023-08-07

* Promise to send her back home and fix things

"Cheers for this! I can get down with that on some level. You‚Äôre right it shouldn‚Äôt need to be moral, and they can be flawed for the sake of the plot. That does make sense and I get that side of it, and to be fair Barbie apologises to Ken! But I also think they have added social commentary, so it‚Äôs not just about flawed characters. The choices made in production happen for a reason, and to me the absurdity and groundedness is out of place when combined with the strong emotions. Like if it‚Äôs all overt comedy, it makes sense to totally invalidate Ken, and if it‚Äôs all serious, it makes sense to highlight that it‚Äôs how women are treated. When you blend the two, it works really well because they play off of each other. But if you also add in a message to love yourself or be present or be human, I just don‚Äôt think it works because that is creating a dialogue between the elements that isn‚Äôt fully cohesive. Being human is a genderless experience, so I kind of would have preferred to have it be like fully comedy ‚Äòfuck you Ken!‚Äô and have him be overtly trashed than to have mixed messages. Or obviously to have it reconciled. To me by the end it‚Äôs not just trying to be a comedy movie, it‚Äôs relevant to the times we live in and speaking directly to that, before reverting to comedy again. There are lots of reasons why it might have been less cohesive than it could have been, like production isn‚Äôt a straight line from writer to film, but I just didn‚Äôt get what it wanted from me as a viewer. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I was also confused. 

HOWEVER I‚Äôm not the core demographic so yaknow, as long as other people have a positive takeaway that‚Äôs what matters!

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt think patriarchy exists in some capacity, or that the messaging is irrelevant. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as coherent as it could have been, and as a result it is socially flawed because it comes at the expense of delivering a stronger argument. Women deserve their rights, and they deserve the right to make a film from a female perspective. But by the end we have strong sentiments that feel like an argument without any real argument to it because it‚Äôs also a comedy so it can‚Äôt have an argument but it does have an argument but it doesn‚Äôt. Like, I‚Äôve covered a lot of flawed films from a feminist perspective that have SUBTLY negative portrayals of women, and this movie isn‚Äôt as bad as those. They‚Äôre subtle because the women and men are comedy characters, or dramatic characters portrayed as nuanced, but if you evaluate it closely there are discrepancies where the depiction is harsher on the female cast. When I apply the same principles I‚Äôd use to evaluate those pieces to this film, the men fall into the same role as the women in those films, and yes it‚Äôs partly intentional, but there‚Äôs still a clear bias within the script. People can downvote all they want but it doesn‚Äôt change that lol - this is a discussion thread to air opinions, and it‚Äôs something worth discussing.

">But, it doesn't bash men/males though. That's some of the erroneous complaints which just is NOT true.

I'll copy and paste a reply I made to an identical comment above:

You're joking, right?

The movie demonized a huge number of benign activities as manifestations of toxic masculinity / ""The Patriarchy"", like watching action movies, exercising, drinking beer with your friends, owning a mini fridge, and horses. Like, wtf? How is liking horses toxic? All of these traditionally ""masculine"" activities are being construed as guilty by association, as if men oppress women, so anything men like is also oppressive and bad.

The message seems to be, ""Don't follow culture, just be yourself. But if you're a man and you like anything stereotypically associated with masculinity, this is by default toxic and bad"". So it doesn't leave men with any clues or any direction, except a nebulous sentiment that you shouldn't do anything unless Barbie approves of it, which actually is misandrist. The film seems to embrace the ""men are defective women"" trope, which is definitionally misandrist.

Then there's the fact that every single man in the entire film, without exception, was portrayed as inherently dumb, morally weak, and some combination of crudely sexist, proudly selfish, and joyously oppressive.

There wasn't a single positive male role model in the entire movie, and no hint of a suggestion of what positive healthy masculinity looks like.

Even Sasha, presumably intended to be a smart but cynical protagonist, comes across as a terminally online loser bigot with extremist views.",2023-07-23

He couldn‚Äôt focus on his own interests or be vulnerable, and he was tired/disinterested in being the leader! Barbie apologized for taking him for granted, and he recognized he needs to find his own hobbies and thoughts. Not allowing men on the Supreme Court was a joke referencing the fact that women hold far less leadership positions in government (every single president has been male‚Ä¶look up RBG‚Äôs ‚Äúuntil there are nine‚Äù quote). 

They even say Ken‚Äôs have as much power in Barbieland as women do in the real world. Which the entire movie has just established is not okay. The movie is poking fun at men who feel they have to be manly stereotypes‚Ä¶and they‚Äôre doing this through a Ken doll. It‚Äôs satire and silliness. 

Just because patriarchy is bad, doesn‚Äôt mean all men are bad. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve included Allan.

I wasn't expecting to hold a Barbie movie to account, but if you're gonna tackle the subject matter like this movie did....then follow through with it and do it right.  Superficial takes just feed people on both sides who will get out of the movie exactly what they wanted to...just using the movie as a shallow vehicle for their pre-existing feelings.

"See, I saw all that and I don't know if it was necessarily shitting on men or highlighting situations that actually affect them. One of the biggest things affecting men in the real world today is loneliness and I think that was well highlighted in this movie. I felt genuinely emotional and related a lot to both Ken and Allen. Allen especially, because by the ideas that the movie fights against, he's seemingly doing everything right. Even so, he's still constantly overlooked and ignored. He understands the women and the issues with toxic masculinity, but that's still not enough. You can just feel the pain behind his eyes when he sees Ken crying and recognizes the same feeling in that moment. The only difference is that for all of the things wrong with Ken, Allen has seemingly fixed, so what's he supposed to do?

As far as the men being morons, at least in Barbieland that's understandable. They're supposed to be caricatures of a very specific view of the world. I didn't have too much of an issue with that and honestly thought they still brought depth to the character in spite of that. It did bug me a bit how, even in the real world, some of the men were excessively silly. And again, for the board, I can write that off as more them shitting on corporate execs than on men. As for Gloria shitting on her husband, I'm definitely with you that I think some people are looking at that wrong. It's a good example of a guy who is trying to do the right thing and seemingly buck the toxic masculinity train, but it's still not enough. 

Maybe I'm just reading in too much, but when I watched it, one of my takeaways was that men really do have problems and despite ""running the world"" it doesn't always feel that way. It doesn't provide any real resolution for the men other than Ken deciding to go work on himself, but even that doesn't fully address the problem, because Allen is just stuck in the same situation without any change. I think that's a good thing for the movie, though, because it's reality for a lot of men today, especially younger men.",2023-08-01

more men should be sitting around and ""wishing they could cry more"" or you know, start acknowledging feelings at all and maybe talk about them. especially with their other male friends. or did I completely misunderstand your point?

I understand the themes present in the movie are there for a reason, but plot and themes are supposed to tie together seamlessly rather than being hacked on together in a sort of shambles attempt at storytelling.

Everyone seems to put down anyone who didn't like this movie as disagreeing with the politics of it. Again this is a weird take. I am a woman and a feminist who enjoys movies and am close to the storytelling world, so I think I have a stronger critique for things such as plot, character development, pace, tone, sound, cinematography, exposition, arcs, etc than the average cinemagoer, and that should be OK, but to put my views down to political alignment because they don't suit you is really telling of the divisive kind of society we live in today, rather than to be able to have real discussions about things we have to shame people.

"> There's no way you're earnestly making the point that this is on par with the social pressures experienced by women.

Everybody exists under social expectations. The point is that the movie's 'feminist critique' is solely about social expectations and not material issues. 

And playing a who has it worse game, is pointless. I could point to men's higher suicide fatality rate, higher rates of deaths of despair like drug abuse, and worsening social isolation with men having fewer friends and fewer relationships. And you could point at other stats. 

But women have a loud and public campaign against social expectations on multiple fronts. While men who also try and go against social expectations are scorned, often by so-called feminists. 

> ""Playing with Ken's feelings"" is not what ""toxic femininity"" is. Toxic femininity describes toxic behaviors that patriarchal societies pressure women into adopting (just like toxic masculinity is that for men). Think being meek, nurturing, playing dumb, being children-obsessed etc. In this sense, the movie does address it with the way Barbies get 'brainwashed' into playing along with patriarchal social norms in Kendom

Engaging in social manipulation to corral and control men, as well as setting them against each other instead of directly confronting them, is literally classic toxic femininity. They didn't try to argue the Kens out of their position, they just set them against each other using their femininity (the only tool that women had in deeply patriarchal societies) and launched a counter-judicial coup. Except the Barbies are the ruling class, so their meekly tip-toeing around makes no sense for their society, only as an allegory for ours.

Wouldn't it have been more feminist, for them to actually win by say arguing their position? We literally have a lawyer Barbie introduced at the start of the movie, and multiple mentions of law stuff.",2023-08-06

"I don't agree. What about ""Weird Barbie""? She was hilarious and very bizarre, with the permanent splits and the burnt off hair, because she had been ""played with too much"", by a Sid in *Toy Story* type.

The Barbies were very silly overall. The fact that they were Nobel Prize Winners and stuff was a joke in itself. The ""doctor"" with fake equipment who doesn't actually do anything: Ken heals immediately because he's a toy who can't get hurt. The ""physicist"" Barbie in a world without real physics. The Barbies and Kens are all vapid creatures in a fake, meaningless world without consequences or mortality. The Barbies thinking they're doing ""important things"" (as Lizzo sings on the soundtrack) and that they've solved all the problems for women is one of the movie's central jokes. But we see how easily the Barbies are brainwashed by the Kens, with one Barbie saying she likes being told what to do because it's like a ""spa day for my brain"". These Barbies hardly fit the Strong Woman trope.

Barbie spouting a load of feminist discourse that she doesn't really understand was a meta joke in itself. This woman is naive, childlike and clearly not a great intellectual. The juxtaposition is humorous. Barbie on the run was a great comedy sequence. The humour of the ""discontinued"" Barbies. The side-splitting ""Depression Barbie"" ad.

The movie pokes a ton of fun at the Barbies: having their feet be permanently stuck in an elevated position, the way they were horrified by ""flat feet"" (the worst thing that can happen to you!), ""drinking"" from empty cups, etc., *The Truman Show*\-esque opening, in which every day consists of an identical ritual of greeting every other Barbie and being cheerily vacuous, Barbie walking on fake water, like a female Jesus in a phony world.

The juxtaposition is maybe what makes it jarring.

Also, a lot of the promo has focused on how subversive it is, how groundbreaking, how genius Greta Gerwig's writing is (and a lot of that came from Greta herself) so some of the disconnect is maybe more to do with the expectations that garnered as much as the writing itself being ""bad.""",2023-07-21

It even was in the movie as the Mattel execs crunched numbers and let Barbie be whatever she wants to be because it was going to sell.

That's why I said I think Barbie at its worst just represents society in that moment. I don't think Mattel toy company is the absolute authority in creating culture and norms, more so reflection of already existing norms.

Personally, I didn't feel like Ken was supposed to be this metaphor for women, he is exploring men's own issues in an interesting, semi-compassionate way, they show he has emotional depth and existential/human needs, but not that much else. Perhaps that's part of the point, that this inner-existential-emotional life is the part that men need to focus on in their own struggle. Still, I'm not a huge fan of this condescending men-being-stupid trope in media. Clueless, yes, manchild maybe, but a lot of the time these characters (I'm not talking about Barbie specifically but this trope in general) seem to be like some sort of Michael Sctott from the Office, which belongs more in a sketch.",2023-07-25

Instead it just takes cheap jabs at the patriarchy and womens empowerment. It would have been a much better movie deprogramming Ken who fell down the incel rabbit hole and establishing his real feelings of inadequacy and loneliness and finding his own path forward independent of Barbie. I feel like they were going towards this with ""I am kenough"" but then it was just rewritten to essentially be a throwaway joke at hurr durr play with mens feelings and get them jealous at each other and we win. 

Not once did any of the kens show cameraderie and support for the other kens emotional feelings and vulnerabilities. They were constantly trying to one-up one another and tear each other down. The movie acts like ""its ok to cry"" but then totally disregards Ken's feelings and expects him to get right back up on the horse. No depression ken, no alcoholic ken, nothing.",2023-07-29

Western films are concerned more than ever with pseudo empowerment. If this had come out in the early 2000s, I think it would have hit harder.

"Except that‚Äôs not true at all. In no film with a big ensemble cast of women are women treated as badly as the men in this film. I can‚Äôt think of a single movie where the entire large female cast are all morons who are doing something wrong. Women are sidelined or love interests - but they‚Äôre never portrayed as a whole gender in such a negative way as both idiots or idiot villains. 

You don‚Äôt seem to get that having a woman in a side role or a stereotypical gender role which was common at the times most movies were made (and still is) is not mocking here or making her look stupid or bad. But here the movie does so for men.

I wonder if you‚Äôve even watched any movies more than ten years old or if you‚Äôve just read how they supposedly were on Reddit or social media.

You‚Äôre reaching and trying to see a brilliant satire when in reality Greta Gerwig just did the same ol ‚Äúmen dumb women good‚Äù trope that you see often played for laughs in sitcoms. And in the process IF she was trying to make that point it was lost as the real world patriachy and women are portrayed so differently and more negative (for patriachy) and positive (for women) than the Barbie matriarchy and Kens.

Also Ken is representing a bunch of things, the oppressed, the patriachy - as well as being a device for Gerwig to joke about men in general. How are you meant to feel sympathy for Ken and the Kens when he‚Äôs the butt of the movies jokes when he does something about his situation, whereas the real world women fighting the patriarchy are these wonderful heroes making speeches.

I just think the bitterness about men shone through and if a positive message was supposed to be there then it‚Äôs only apparent to feminist women who can easily overlook the way this movie portrays men as stupid or stupid and bad - but the bitterness against men means for a lot of men they can‚Äôt overlook that. Hard to see a movie as anti sexism when it comes off as laughing about sexism against men.",2023-07-24
Sure so it's up to Barbie to decide when they want to give power to Kens. For something men do to women in the real world that Ken doesn't have any control over. Sounds to me like using one form of injustice (patriarchy in real world) to justify your own (matriarchy in barbie land),2023-07-31
"Right, bit the movie is also saying that women in the real world DONT have equality. Therefore, saying ""one day the Ken's will have the same level of power as Women in the Real World"" is the same as saying ""the Ken's will never have equality""

It felt vengeful, like were supposed to be happy they are kept down. Jesus, even of youdont think they're mentally ""ready"" for power, you could at least give them houses. That would have shown that barbiland is changing towards equality AMF the Barbies realize they've been unfair to the Ken's.

As a man or woman this movie serves as an excellent coming of age movie. I guess you just have to grow up to relate to the characters. Ken reminds me of 8th grade me trying everything i can to be macho and appealing and falling down a pipeline and later realizing that indocrination further alienated me from the people i wanted to connect to,2023-07-26
You bring up a good point about the way she was treated in the real world.  I guess I was referring more to the Barbieland when she's not displaying emotions as much.,2023-07-26
"Just the kind of dialogue that Greta was hoping to inspire, I'm sure.",2023-07-26
"That point was the only good aspect of the film and by the end of the film, it only shows some development of characters on women‚Äôs side, but still dominating them and men continued being dominated. Instead equality should‚Äôve been approached in Barbieland, if they wanted to preach about any propaganda. A world where women and men can be equals, without being desperate for each other‚Äôs affection as obviously Ken was.",2023-07-26
"That was literally the point, and I imagine that will go over a lot of people's heads. The Barbies weren't the good guys in that movie. They wanted their 'normal' back (read: when they had everything and kens existed for them).

This is a direct parallel to the anti-feminist movement wanting the 60's back (when men had everything and woman existed for them). They even said as much right at the end",2023-07-24
"I agree but I think the writers kind of shot themselves in the foot with the ending scene where the Kens ask the President Barbie if they can have a supreme court seat and she says no, and then there's some line about how ""someday maybe the Kens will have as much power as women in the real world"". 

I feel like it was really bordering on the poignant and satisfying ending you described but then kind of threw it away by sending the Kens back to square on and clearly relegating them to second class citizens in Barbie Land again rather than the two sides learning to live in harmony. Instead it's almost like the Kens get punished for abandoning their toxic masculinity and being open to change. 

Even though I don't think it was their intent, it kind of makes it seem like the movies whole message was ""men just suck and women should be in charge"" despite that clearly not being the message of the previous 2 hours.",2023-07-23

"They gave Ken a sympathetic moment where he was like ‚Äúyeah, I guess it‚Äôs *my* house and *my* world now, huh? How do *you* like it?‚Äù, and it was like, oh, yeah, he has a point, since the Kens were mistreated. And then the movie gives up on that and the resolution doesn‚Äôt really address it. I get that it was probably making a point about how progress can be slow with stuff like the Kens being maybe given a lower-circuit court seat or something, but there was no attempt at a message of ‚Äúhey, maybe we should work toward becoming equal‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe tokenizing Kens is wrong, and so is tokenizing women in the real world‚Äù. Ken equality is not even presented as an aspirational goal, from what I remember. It could‚Äôve ended on a positive note about how we can overcome the negative aspects of either gender dominating everything and work together to achieve a better world where nobody is a second-class citizen, but instead they said ‚Äúactually, it‚Äôs good that the matriarchy was restored‚Äù. They just inverted the patriarchy and told us to celebrate when it prevailed.

I dunno, maybe I‚Äôm misreading it and the entire ending was only supposed to be a commentary on how women‚Äôs rights in the real world have often begun with tokenism, but the rest of the film was making much broader points, and it didn‚Äôt work in that context if that‚Äôs what they were trying to say.",2023-07-22
Weird no one is taking about that. The inherent hypocrisy of the message. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so evil that women(Barbie‚Äôs) are seen as lesser than. Then they return the Kens (men) to their lower station in society and it‚Äôs a good thing lol.,2023-07-22

The america Ferrera speech was great and I was snapping the whole time but it directly excluded me with it's diction? I am not a ken and I am not a Barbie, so how am I supposed to take this not identifying with either end of the gendered extremes? Am I just supposed to laugh and then feel sad about the state of societal discourse after?",2023-08-16
"The thing is, I would agree except they don't change anything at the end.

If for example the Barbies and Kens realise that a society where only one gender dominates is bad, then there could have been a compromise whereby both genders collaborate together to run society together. Maybe don't show all the guys except Alan in the show to either be dumb himbos or incompetent executives that oppress and sexualize women. 

But nope, at the end of the movie they refuse to give the Kens any power in Barbieland or any meaningful role. Yes, I agree that Ken's story of not leaning solely on someone as your whole identity was a good message, but when you still re-impose the matriarchal society with little to no meaningful changes in terms of representation, its not hard to see why people took away the message that ""Barbie is man-hating"".",2023-08-15

"The point would get better reception if Gerwig hadn‚Äôt written all the Real world men and Kens as stupider than their female counterparts and in need of correction. And the movie is clearly made for women in part to laugh at men. If the movie had of actually shown Kens more sympathetically and Barbies as more villainous then you would have a point - but it doesn‚Äôt. Kens are shown as bad for the Kendom whereas women are good for standing up to the patriachy. The problem was making Ken both the stand-in for womens oppression and the patriachy.

This movie is actually more bad than good for gender relations Imo. Because now some guys are gonna think - Well it was alright for the Barbie movie to potray us so badly and when we were offended women didn‚Äôt care so now we can write women as bimbos or sex objects and not care if they‚Äôre offended.",2023-08-06
"Right but the movie isn't consistent with that idea, at all. Unless we're to believe that the monologue about women's struggles is a joke? The movie clearly has a lot of moments where it wants to be taken seriously, and - as I pointed out - a lot of moments where female characters become lucid and emotionally intelligent, while male characters are *always* stupid.

I would actually love this movie if it were 2 hours of what we see in the first 15 minutes: a flipped version of our world. A matriarchy. We could see both men and women's harmful behaviour highlighted by the opposite gender. It would be a really interesting look at how people react when a female character exhibits negative male behaviours, and vice versa. Do they feel more annoyed at the actions or the gender of the person?

But that's not what happens. We get 15 minutes of that premise, then we go to the hyper-patriarchal real world and then back to a hyper-patriarchal Barbie world for the rest of the movie. The matriarchy is barely critiqued at all.",2023-08-05

"Edit: I‚Äôm a woman who grew up with Barbie‚Äôs btw

Just because there are movies that treat women bad doesn‚Äôt make it right? I think the kens were treated badly and their struggle not taken seriously enough. Not to the degree that commenter says but I do think they did them dirty. Especially with the idea people have that the kens deserve to be treated that way because men in the real world are bad or that female characters have been portrayed that way forever so now it‚Äôs mens turn. 

If it was just a comedy and satire I could see that being funny but a movie trying to make a message about the patriarchy and making Ken characters second class citizens and saying they deserve it while also comparing them to real world women is just not the move. I guarantee that the mostly white woman audience would be upset if they treated all the white Barbie‚Äôs as bad people or bimbos just because historically POC women have been treated that way in movies so now it‚Äôs white women‚Äôs turn.",2023-07-22

"But the film kinda paints him as the ""ideal"" man by how he acts and yet he still becomes an afterthought, whilst it might be satire if it's the film as a whole relegating him not just the characters then it doesn't feel very good for the viewers. So it's really just a hypocritical cycle. Essentially the non-problematic men in the film are bullied and sidelined whilst the focus is on the toxic ones. Considering this is a film about a toy aimed at young girls, it's not really sending a great message that men who spend their time learning another language or dont want to live patriarchal society are a joke (unless they're beating up the bad men). It sort of plays like the ""Allans"" of this world are supposed to stand up to and beat up the Ken's when necessary then keep their mouth shut and be placid when there isn't an issue. Satire is best when used to highlight something blatantly wrong, but everyone already knows it's wrong to disregard unattractive women and there's been a big movement in recent years for a variety of women to be portrayed in various ways.",2023-07-30

I still find some scenes a bit boring, but Gosling is a show stealer, so he makes the movie enjoyable and I think it's a well crafted movie with some good ideas and nice homages to 2001 Space Oddysey and Being There.

But I can see I get a lot of downvotes, most likely from women who takes it personally that I did not care much for Barbie in Barbie. My problem isn't even a Ben Shapiro problem about ridiculing men, cause the movie also ridicules women. All that I thought was fun and tounge in cheek, but the movie overall lacked something for me or perhaps my expectations were just too high. I never angered me, it just underwhelmed me a bit. But again on second watch it's a fine movie. Not as bad as I initially thought.

But it's funny how angered people get if you don't like Barbie as much as they do or Greta Gerwig. I actually wrote a thread about Greta and Barbie movie, but people went nuts and irate, so I had to delete it, cause it really didn't went anywhere else than snark replies and angered women and men. I am glad your partner could understand or at least respect your view on the movie. Most seem to not be able to.

It is really a movie that gets people triggered, they are very passionate about a movie about a toy doll.

All men in the movie are portrayed as idiots.

The message is ridiculous and sexist. Especially as this movie present itself as fighting against sexism

You made a sexist stereotype in your comment. Why would Oppenheimer be for men only? Is a movie about the atomic bomb about men?

The reason Barbie is insidious is because it is sexist in all aspect to men like the movies for men are sexist towards women. Not only that, but the producers seem proud of that. This is certainly not the right way to fight gender inequality.

There are no male movies like that that cast women like that - not just today but ever. Yes women may have bit parts or be there for sex appeal, but I can‚Äôt think of a single movie in which a large cast of women are all idiot villains for men to overcome.

How many little girls played with Barbie thinking Ken was a halfwit who was bad to Barbie? Not many I‚Äôd bet. But this is what the movie is so I‚Äôm not sure saying this is how girls played with barbies is much defense.",2023-07-24

As does having Ken fill multiple roles - patriach, toxic, opressed - all at once. 

Ultimately feminist women won‚Äôt get it and try to say it‚Äôs brilliant satire men are missing, but the simple reality is you can‚Äôt say a movie is about equality and men shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it when literally every male character is an idiot or a villain idiot.

"There is a difference between Barbie apologising to Ken for treating him poorly, and implying that Barbies are the cause of men installing patriarchy. Beyond the movie itself, it‚Äôs a bad message for young girls. Notice how Barbies treated Ken poorly by deciding to have girls nights every night and just ignoring them, while the Kens instead objectified them, degraded them and purposefully belittled them. The only bad thing Barbies did was that Kens were more or less homeless. The Kens went out of their way to hurt the Barbies. They didn‚Äôt just do it because they were hurt, they found out the privileges they got from dominating Barbies, which is a fundamental aspect of why men choose to participate in patriarchy despite their poor feelings.

Then again, I don‚Äôt expect any redditors to have any knowledge on actual feminist theory besides basic ‚Äúwomen and men plz be nice so we can all be equal‚Äù so no I don‚Äôt think I can make you understand that saying women are at fault in men choosing to oppress them, rather than men choosing it for themselves due to seeing the material rewards they get from being abusive and toxic, is wrong.

The 11 downvotes prove what I was believing though. Women bend their ways to make feminism the most appealing, easy, comfortable movement ever for men. But the second you even point out a little uncomfortable truth, like ‚Äúmen don‚Äôt participate in patriarchy as a response to women being inconsiderate of their feelings, but because of the material and social advantages they get from said participation. Women‚Äôs aversion is a response to this, not the other way around.‚Äù Everyone loses their shit and says it‚Äôs anti men and every man and their fellow pick mes comes out with their pitchforks. 

We don‚Äôt need any wishy washy good feeling feminism because feminism is meant to make people like you uncomfortable. I‚Äôm muting this comment.

Michael J Fox plays an original Ken who is now elderly, discarded, and broken. Using a Hot Wheels RC Barbie Corvette, a mint in-the-box flux capacitor powered by the Sword of Omens, Ken attempts to travel into the past to murder himself, thus avoiding a meaningless life.

"the smallpox analogy fell flat on its face for me and was incredibly tone deaf.

The entire films tries to reflect our world using toys but in the end, there is no good way to execute that because toys are literally toys. 

Native Americans had their land invaded and killed by an unseen physical affliction that they had no power or choice to stop. Their bodies had literally no immunity. Families, communities, cultures died. And this film wants to use that as an analogy for the easy brainwashing of supposed super intelligent sentient toy women beings (???) Sorry.

The men wanted to just be viewed as with the women, but the women viewed it as some sort of egotistical power play. They viewed everything through the lens of power instead of basic social need.

Men in the real world are different story.

As for women, I could dissect it all day. It all just basically comes down to the authors seemed to have a horrible chip on their shoulders combined with some smug, ""Boy, Barbie really doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it?"" No, she doesn't. Aren't you fuckin clever?
 
For one, ""letting women have jobs"" doesn't mean you respect them. Harvey Weinstein hired women. It was an unusual interview process, but he hired them. But this seemed to be half of the ""respect"" lobbed upon women in the movie was their jobs. Also, nice motherhood tropes in the movie. Smashing baby dolls (not subtle), I think 3 jokes making fun of the (yes, she's creepy) pregnant Barbie from the past and the only real mother in the movie being a miserable, depressed husk with a horrid daughter. Respecting women means giving them middle class jobs and shitting on motherhood. Whatever.

Further, Barbie represents an archetype for women of sorts. She is an ideal of sorts within that category. Is this ideal attainable? Of course not. One of the criticisms of Barbie (the toy) is that it's giving an ideal for little girls to attain that they just can't and it makes them sad. Admittedly, I'm not a little girl, but constantly revenge shitting on that ideal seems cruel. You could make He-Man into a paraplegic to prove some point about strength, but why would you do that? It's unnecessary. 

I am also highly against punishing people for their virtues and the movie just shits all over her sunny innocence, which is pleasant in this bleak hellscape ""2nd Gilded Age"" we live in. Oh cool. The teenage girl is edgy and angry and calls Barbie a fascist (yes, I am aware she had an arc). I'm just not impressed. And I understand Barbie is supposed to grow and adapt to the real world but a lot of the dialogue felt like it came from a woman who wanted revenge against a toy for some unresolved childhood anger. Or better yet, just some ironic, totally detached, ""Yeah, we can enjoy Barbie, but we should feel totally bad about it"". Enjoy Barbie if you want and let everyone else fuck off. 

And so much of this movie (especially the intro to the real world and the end) is filled with this ""women are prey"" tone that does nothing but weaken a woman's place in the world. Are women potentially in danger? Yes. Is each individual woman being assaulted 30 times an hour? No. Hey women! Why not just develop agoraphobia, work from home, watch Netflix and order Uber Eats for the rest of your life? Depression Barbie! I understand the movie requires a tightened timeline, but it's just an awful lens into reality. 

And then finally, she meets (NOT) God and (NOT) God is like, ""People die. Ideas live forever. What would you like to be, STEREOTYPICAL Barbie?"" and Barbie decides to ""adapt to the real world"", cease to be an idea and plunge her way towards an inevitable death. ""Fuck Barbie. Not like we needed her around anyways"". 

I spit on this movie. Let people enjoy things and shove your ironic detachment back into your no-budget indie schlock.

I understand the movie requires a tightened timeline, but it's just an awful lens into reality.

And then finally, she meets (NOT) God and (NOT) God is like, ""People die. Ideas live forever. What would you like to be, STEREOTYPICAL Barbie?"" and Barbie decides to ""adapt to the real world"", cease to be an idea and plunge her way towards an inevitable death. ""Fuck Barbie. Not like we needed her around anyways"".

I spit on this movie. Let people enjoy things and shove your ironic detachment back into your no-budget indie schlock.

I really think that when the memes and hype pass, we're going to look back on this movie with embarrassment that it was enjoyed.",2023-07-22
"I'm not a fan of the "" haha men=bad"" thing. I took my little sister thinking it's gonna be a movie for her. She loves barbie. After 30 minutes she told me she's bored. I was bored myself, but thought ""hey,  maybe it'll get better "" it didn't. It only got worse. I thought it was gonna be a lighthearted movie about barbie trying to get out of the human world, not some weird feminist project. The same thing happened with "" birds of pray"". I don't like this trope. It's tacky, boring and just uncomfortable to watch. The lines are just too unrealistic. The plot was a mess. Nothing really happened. I'm just curious who was the intended audience? It wasn't a kids movie, but the tackiness made it look like a children's movie. I'm not a picky guy when it comes to films. For example I really liked the new avatar movie and still I don't get the hate it got.  I'm gonna get down voted to oblivion for this but I think this movie is sexist. I didn't like that men were brought down to being degenerates, idiots and assholes. Do these type of men exist? Yes. But you cant just take a group and slap on it every stereotype possible. Turning the sexism around is a shitty move in my opinion. 

This is MY opinion and I have a right to it. You can disagree and I'm open to discussing as long as it not hostile.",2023-07-22

Bahahahah feminism is only used when it benefits the woman I guarantee if a woman told random feminists ‚Äúhey you know I actually don‚Äôt want a career and want to take care of my family‚Äù those feminists would react negatively

Definitely a smart and complex movie, but it only used silence for certain kinds of effect, not really to let scenes breathe.

She'd post on the sub rateme or truerateme or whatever it is and be told she's a 6 at best.,2023-07-23

Yeah I wanted to see their living Kenditions.,2023-07-23
"I loved the movie, but having it end with the Barbies saying that not even one Ken could be on the Supreme Court imo made the movie miss the mark a bit. Whole point is patriarchy‚Äôs bad, but oh wait original matriarchy with second-class Kens is also bad, so was really hoping for a more ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on an even level‚Äù society.

"I noticed that with Allan, but I can't remember the deal with the two discarded Kens. One was Sugardaddy Ken, right?",2023-07-23
I actually feel it hits more deep than that. The Kens that were discarded would have been dolls targeted at young girls. Ken has always been there to want after Barbie (Barbie's boyfriend but on her terms). The discarded Ken's don't fit that role,2023-07-24

There's lots of little subtle brilliances like that in the movie.",2023-07-23
Earing Ken was gay coded even when he came out (I missed Sugar Daddy Ken).  But Allen was married to Midge so it is weird that he tried to ditch her.,2023-07-24

1. He argued that pedos who hadn't done anything should get treatment, which is valid. However, he made a callous comparison of the situation of pedos to gay people. People spread misinformation that he supports pedos and that he's a pedo himself, which is not true. 

2. tl;dr He made some pretty annoying remarks on Twitter about his career and the film industry and some filmmakers.

I love that the film doesn‚Äôt make Gosling‚Äôs Ken and the other Kens evil in the traditional sense once they found out about patriarchy but are deep down trying to find what their purpose and place.

"Honestly, he and Margot SHOULD receive Best Actor nominations for this film. Yes, they were really silly roles, but they absolutely disappeared into them.

  


You can see the amount of time they spent finding every little quirk about these characters and the effort they put in to not only bring them to life, but also be taken seriously. Ken is an unexpected antagonist of the film and I want him to lose, but I also see where he's coming from and believe that he believes in his mission.

  


And Margot was just BORN for this role. You just see her fall apart as she realizes that not only is she not perfect but that it's okay. Margot is one of the most beautiful women on the planet (movie even says so) but she plays this part where I trust her when she says she doesn't feel beautiful.

I see Ken and Barbie because they're there, not just because the movie tells me that they're Ken and Barbie. That's acting and despite the comedic roles, it's some of the best I've seen this year. Again, movie straight up literally tells me that that's Margot Robbie and I still see Barbie.

‚ÄúSnyder Cut‚Äù is the exact way it‚Äôs referenced,2023-07-21
I won't be surprised if Greta Gerwig is a casual lurker on /r/moviescirclejerk,2023-07-21
As a man watching this with a group of women I just kept thinking to myself ‚Äúman this Ken ran place sounds kinda cool‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm part of the problem aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù,2023-07-21
It was a great pop culture reference. The fact that it got people mad kind of proves the movie's point. Coming from someone who thought ZSJL was a vast improvement over the theatrical cut.,2023-07-21
"He's completely missing the point that it's nothing to do with the actual film itself, it's the behaviour of the culture of fandom around it.",2023-07-22
1000% sure Zack Snyder would laugh at that bit too.,2023-07-24
Got a link?,2023-07-25
"By that logic the movie is also saying that The Godfather is a beacon of toxic masculinity and incels, yet Gerwig is on record talking about loving that film. As a person who really likes ZSJL, it honestly just felt like a throwaway gag about dudes and their obsessions.",2023-07-24
Why wouldn‚Äôt they? They‚Äôre not on good terms w Snyder i thought and the botched theatrical version remains their canon version,2023-07-21
Yeah to be honest it kinda pissed me off.,2023-07-21
I'm just takes a lot to get me to actually laugh out loud in theatres. Most films get me to giggle even while many people are actually laughing. But that ZS jab was just hilarious imo I couldn't hold myself back lmao,2023-08-16
Yeah I loved that joke and was simultaneously angry at how well that tactic would have worked for distracting me.,2023-07-21
"Yeah, as a former film student I had flashbacks to Godfather dude-bros. Scarface would have been another excellent choice.",2023-07-23
"I am aware of that; I've seen the movie.

Gosling *was* absolutely excellent. But let's put it this way: this film could exist without Gosling and his Ken. It would be a lesser film, and significantly less funny, but it could exist just fine without him. 

However, it could absolutely *not* exist without Robbie and her Barbie. Robbie, as the producer, is the reason this film exists at all. She is also the reason that Gosling's Ken exists, as she personally got him on board. All this provides a complementary meta overlayer to the film's premise, which is that Ken exists *because of* and *secondary to* Barbie.

As for film's content, the main reason it is resonating with its target and primary audience of *women* is Barbie's journey towards becoming a *real woman,* and her experiences of the real world on the way: her encounters with women from several generations (the old woman, the mother and her daughter), her discovery of physical imperfection and not feeling good enough, her experience of sexual harassment, etc. This is the heart of the film and it would be a somewhat throwaway comedy without it. Of course, most of the female audience is not commenting on Reddit.

Saying that Gosling ""carried"" the film is akin to saying that Eowyn ""carried""  the *The Lord of the Rings* films, as opposed to, you know, its male heroes/protagonists, Frodo, Sam and Aragorn. Now, Eowyn was a highlight and some people's *favourite* part of the trilogy, but she in no way *carried* it. Credit where credit's due. 

Most of the people I have seen making these aggrandising claims for Gosling, often at Robbie's expense, have been men (at least assumed). Some are falling over themselves to claim this woman-led, woman-centred and woman-targeted film ""for the boys"". One professional male commentator went as far as to reduce Robbie's role to [""running around in nice dresses""](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/ryan-gosling-ken-barbie-movie). His article read like a parody, but I think it was actually serious...",2023-07-29

"How do you guys even notice what car they are product placing? I was so involved in the narrative, I couldn't care if they were driving beetles",2023-07-26
"I love all car chase scenes, even really bad ones, so I had a great time and it's one of my absolute favourite scenes of the movie, but yeah, thinking about it, it was definitely a car commercial.

For some reason I had a massive brain fart about this and I literally thought the blue car was a Toyota for like 2 days until I was talking about it to a friend and she was like, actually it's a Chevy. üòÇüòÇ Doing a very quick comparison of the Chevy Blazer and the Toyota Corolla Cross, while obviously not perfect, I can definitely see why I came to that conclusion because the front ends are vaguely similar. Then again, pretty much all car manufacturers seem to look similar within vehicle classes these days...

Obviously I identified the Tahoes correctly right away, but to be fair, they're also not a totally unusual car chase scene/bad guy car choice.",2023-07-31
The joke about who taught the mom the drive like that *was* hilarious though.,2023-08-13
Idk know why but the Chanel stood out to me so much. Birkenstocks kinda made fun of themselves in this but there‚Äôs a scene wheres she‚Äôs holding a Chanel purse and she has the huge jeweled Chanel necklace and I think earrings? They felt so out of place.,2023-07-21
Unless you know the brand you wouldn‚Äôt know what they are. I feel like the gag only worked because they are in the zeitgeist. And they only get shown twice for a couple seconds each. The Chevy chase was a whole damned commercial.,2023-07-21
Please let me keep reading it as gay and not marketing.,2023-07-21
"Looked like it, accelerated really quick",2024-01-28

"But Allan is supposed to be an admirable character, isn‚Äôt he? I don‚Äôt get it. Is Gerwig trying to make fun of *NSYNC here, and what about?",2023-08-05
That is some classic Allan-ing right there,2023-07-26
"Ack, you've given the most thorough description of the joke so far, and I still don't get it. Would you mind helping me out? What are the essential characteristics of Allan that match up with Justin Timberlake? To me, Timberlake has (or had) star quality. He was often the lead singer on N'Sync tracks, and became the group's breakout star. Allan is none of those things. he's an easily forgotten background character. Whereas Ken is routinely ignored, from where i stand, Allan is even less consequential to most Barbie owners. I don't understand why the movie chose to compare him with Timberlake or N\*Sync.",2023-08-14

"Yes to the second part of what you said, I said that too. But where was the part of the joke that is people who are fascists don‚Äôt know it. If you‚Äôre implying Barbie was a fascist but didn‚Äôt know it, I‚Äôd have to disagree, because she isn‚Äôt a fascist.

"Okay so the message is basically that men should just accept they will not be with a woman anymore and to just find happiness in themselves because they'll be forever alone anyway. Nice.   


How can you honestly think this will work for the majority of men? Like ""finding happiness in yourself"" is just an easy thing that everyone can just decide to do. I know it's not impossible, throughout history there have been many ascetics and mystics who have found happiness by giving up their worldy desires. But these were always just a fringe group who put in the effort and had the spiritual reasons and desire of love from the universe and could handle not being in society.  


The assumption that the majority of men should just give up their desire of love from women is such an unrealistic and dumb one. Love from women is literally the no1 thing men want in their life. Imagine every male McDonalds worker to follow your and the movie's advice to suddenly not look for happiness outside himself. He would literally stop working at McDonalds because there is no reason to work at McDonalds except if you want to save up some money, hope to get laid and eventually marry a nice woman. Do you not realise that society and capitalism is literally based on the idea that men have to work for woman's love?   


I also don't like the way you are assumming I'm falling into the hypermasculinity trap or whatever. First of all, the most attractive girls go for the meanest, most hypermasculine men they can find in my experience. This is not just a moot argument and you know it.   


I know men and women should be working out their differences but that is simply not possible if women continuously go for the worst of men and put 0 value into loving a man and supporting him.   


I know I would give so much of my energy and love to a woman if she loved me back and was loyal with me. And no that's not just me saying that because I am desperate, I would literally love her just because i love love. It's just that the dating market is so fucking skewed right now and women are abusing it like factory bosses are abusing their workers. And I get it, it's the first time period where women get to shine and show the world what they can do. They are not yet used to the responsibility that comes with their newfound power. I know they'll do eventually because there is nothing wrong with women.  


Just remember this prediction when women realize in 20 years that they have ruined men and now have to truly build up culture again for the first time. They'll cringe at what they did in this age to think they can use men as sexual toys and not care about marriage and relationships.",2023-07-21

Will Farrel and the rest of the business men are absolutely idiots while meanwhile America Ferrara is has better ideas than them.

No the genders are not reversed - there are not movies which portray the entire female gender as bumbling morons doing the wrong thing and belittle their interests. There‚Äôs a wide difference between that and women not being main characters or movies being made for a male audience - there are movies made for women which sideline men or have them as basic romantic leading men as well.

"Yes, you aren't American and probably not a lawyer so you aren't seeing the nuance.  The Constitution protects against ""intentional"" bias and discrimination against women.  But it does not protect against systemic incidental discrimination against women.  

In other words, American law takes into account whether an action is intentional or not.  Other countries may only look at the results or the effects of actions and not consider what the intent is (which is very difficult to know).  

That's why we Americans need a separate Equal Rights Amendment.  Time after time, we've seen that the 14th amendment is not up to the task of protecting women.  We need to make it clear that discrimination against women is illegal whether it's intentional or not.",2023-08-07

There are places where it is now *illegal* to prescribe, dispense or take certain medications that are used specifically to keep the person taking them alive, because the side effects cause miscarriage. There are states that are letting women die because they decided a clump of cells had more right to life than a fully actualised adult (or child, unfortunately) even though the clump of cells had zero chance of developing beyond that. You decided a law that specifically limits women by targeting a bodily function that natural born males physically will not ever be at risk of, doesn't qualify as oppression because it only impacts women?

What the fuck?  The movie has a *solid* through line about how Barbieland is a biased, unfair matriarchy as much as the real world is a biased, unfair patriarchy.  And then it ends the movie by saying ""nah, that's fine.""  It throws away its message immediately after having a *huge scene* about calling it out.  The movie ends with literally no one learning anything nor a clear message that that's the point.  The entire movie is about self-awareness then ends in hypocrisy.

"Loads of movies before 1960 have strong female characters. Yeah sure some may be in stereotypical gender situations - but that‚Äôs because the whole world was that way then so how else would they be shown? The mistake is thinking their portrayal is weak just because of that. For instance I just watched a Hitchcock movie from 1942 called Shadow of a doubt and there‚Äôs a teen girl in it as the star who is obviously clever and is called the head of her family (her father and his friends are idiots) and is kind of the foil to the main villain. I wonder if you‚Äôve seen many films from the 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs to say that there are no strong female characters. There are quite a few 50‚Äôs sci fi movies with female scientists and astronauts.

Anyway If the point was to explain to men what it feels like to be a woman surely the Barbie movie was a bad vehicle as the audience is statistically skewing 73% female at this point and a large portion of the men who go will just be taking kids or their with a date and barely paying attention. Regardless perhaps what men do go would be more receptive to the messages of women‚Äôs struggles, if they weren‚Äôt presented in a movie ripping on men and portraying them as morons for the rest of the time.

I hardly think being a woman makes you more uniquely qualified to know the corporate history of Barbie or the protests about the doll.
Here let me mansplain it to you as those who liked the movie might say - Barbie was never a feminist icon, that‚Äôs an interpretation from like this year when this movie was announced. Feminists protested the doll in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs when the female founder and CEO of the company was still in charge. Men didn‚Äôt just kick her out either she had to leave because of tax evasion scandals. Barbie wasn‚Äôt rebranded it was the same basic doll.

Barbies careers in the 60‚Äôs were shit like nurse and teachers assistant, which was stuff women had done forever already - the astronaut was because space was all the rage then. Barbies careers have always been an excuse to get her new outfits so they could keep selling the doll. Without that they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to keep bringing out new looks. But regardless our difference of opinion here seems to be that you consider women having any career back then as feminist whereas I can‚Äôt do that, when many of the women of the time taking part in career wouldn‚Äôt have called themselves feminists or been considered such by feminists.

Look I‚Äôm glad you liked Barbie and don‚Äôt want to take pleasure from something you grew up liking from you, and don‚Äôt want to tell you Barbie dolls haven‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt empower young girls because I‚Äôm happy they do and I‚Äôm glad you feel that way.

I see that mostly as a plot device because it inspires Ken to take over Barbieland, but he could have been inspired by a more realistic ""real world"". For example, Mattel's board of directors is 50% women. From Ken's perspective, that would have been inspiring. But they decided to make it 100% blithering idiot men because it's funnier.

I dunno, I agree that there were some poor choices made, but at the same time, I find them all at least defensible and overall I liked the movie.",2023-08-06
I perceived the comedy in the ken scene as not that it was funny that he was crying but that it was funny that he was so confused and ashamed by it - kind of making fun of how men put pressure on themselves to posture toughness. But I do agree overall the movie had a very shallow message of just women= good and men= bad however I also strongly disagree that this shallow portrayal is what would appeal to feminist women. It is what would appeal to buzzFeed girl boss feminists maybe- so basically people with an equally shallow understanding of feminism. Real feminists would actually want to see the movie genuinely portray the nuances of how women contribute to patriarchy and men are also disadvantaged by it,2023-08-08
"> It was kind of a false support for men imo. For instance in the scene where Ken is crying and Barbie tells him it‚Äôs alright to cry - Ken wails in a comedic over the top way which is clearly meant to be funny.

Huh, I guess I just didn't view the way in which he was crying as making fun of the idea of men expressing their feelings. To me it was just the way Gosling's Ken acted, since he was pretty flamboyant throughout the movie, even when it came to his masculinity. I can see where you're coming from though, had his Ken cried in a more toned down way it might not have undercut the message for you.

But for me the comedy of that moment was from him doing the stereotypical ""woman cares about my feelings so that must mean she wants to be with me"" thing that exists throughout media (and IRL, really).

> All real world men and Kens were written as significantly stupider than their female counterparts.

I get it, but remember they're meant to be a kind of manifestation of Mattel toys. I dunno much about Barbie, so I just figured they haven't made a ""astrophysicist Ken"" or ""marine biologist Ken"". Could be totally off-base on that one. But maybe Barbie in the real world can influence Mattel to make those :)",2023-08-09
"It wrote all the Kens and real world men as stupid compared to their female counterparts and also morally worse and needing to change.
The part where it showed it was ‚Äúalright for men to be sensitive‚Äù was where Ken cried and Barbie told him it was ok. But contrast when Barbie cried to Kens crying scene - Barbie crying was a serious and sympathetic moment, Ken wails in a comedic fashion which is clearly meant to be amusing. 

So the message is saying that it‚Äôs alright for men to be sensitive - but what‚Äôs on screen is showing men being sensitive as a joke. 
It hits the right feminist talking point that it‚Äôs alright for men to cry, but also shows a beaten man crying as a big joke and so allows the very same types who whole heartedly buy into men crying being ok, to laugh at a man who is crying while still feeling feminist about it.

Is men being sensitive ok or is it a joke? The movie and Greta Gerwig can‚Äôt seem to decide. Now I‚Äôm not saying men crying can‚Äôt be shown for comedic effect - but pushing a serious message that it‚Äôs alright for men to cry at the same time as showing their crying as funny,
comes off as very contradictory and hypocritical,
especially when it‚Äôs coming from a movie made by a feminist woman whose dead serious with her ‚Äúpatriachy hurts men too and men should be more sensitive‚Äù
Message she‚Äôs thinks she‚Äôs educating men about.

You know Rambo already pushed the message it was alright for men to cry if they needed to - and that was like 4 decades ago and didn‚Äôt play the moment as a joke. I hardly think Barbie has done any wonderful thing for men in showing a scene of a man crying in a comedic way for laughs.",2023-08-06

"While I see where you‚Äôre coming from, I don‚Äôt think Barbieland is at all meant to represent an ideal society. 

I think it‚Äôs actually the opposite way around- Barbieland reverses expected gender roles and stereotypes satirically to illustrate  and critique our real-life societal issues regarding those topics.

I would go as far as to argue Barbieland is supposed to be a critique of feminism. The Barbies live in a delusional bubble where they believe they‚Äôve cured the world of inequality. Meanwhile, the film goes on to show us this couldn‚Äòt be further from the truth.   


This disconnect from reality represents today‚Äôs mainstream brand of feminism, in which women call themselves girl bosses, reclaim their sexuality and think that feminism has won. This ignores the struggles and barriers in place for women, especially those with intersecting identities like being a women who‚Äôs also a racial minority.

"Mean girls is a film made for women - it‚Äôs hardly in the same vein of a film for men ragging in women in a mean spirited way like Barbie does.

Comedy has nothing to do with punching up or down and it definitely hasn‚Äôt always done so - that‚Äôs a modern progressive idea. 

It‚Äôs not any one stereotype that I can‚Äôt find funny, it‚Äôs the constant stereotypes of everything men like as dumb and all male characters as bad. I can laugh at jokes at mens expense and have in other movies - but when a movie is nothing but dumb men endlessly mocked while competent women are upheld - then clearly the jokes all add up into one big pile of bitterness against men which is very obvious.",2023-07-23

"I think the movie was confused on what message it really wanted to be about and end with. Like you're saying, the whole ""I want to be human thing"" doesn't feel super believable or even like it should have been the main goal for barbie, almost thrown in at the end there. But in terms of the patriarchy and matriarchy plot, the reason I find Ken's conclusion and plot so hollow is that the movie shows that in the real world Ken STILL doesn't have power, he can't get a job anywhere just cause he's a man, he thinks people asking him for the time was respecting him. Even Ruth at the end says ""people make up things like patriarchy"" in order to deal with their problems and make excuses. So it really felt like the film didn't fully buy in or believe that men had ACTUAL full power in the real world and it made me think that it was actually taking the plot in a direction where it was going to address the problems and expectations of both men and women and attempt to reconcile them. 

Buuuut then it felt like they remembered it was a Barbie movie and not a Ken movie so they just sorta went ""you're fine Ken, get over it."" Feels like a big missed opportunity",2023-07-24

It's okay to just be you, it's okay to be a man, you don't have to impress anyone, you don't have to be rich, you don't have to get women, you're enough and you're just you. A really positive message for men in my opinion.",2023-07-27
"There is no movie new or old that portrays every member of a large female cast as a moron and tries to show how their gender is doing the wrong thing - over and over and over. Even the teen girls father is a bumbling idiot who is mocked and discarded by his wife and daughter.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a female characters only purpose to be to further the male main characters story line. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a male main characters purpose being to further a female main characters story line. There‚Äôs a wide difference between that and potraying every member of a gender as a moron who‚Äôs doing something bad.

Plenty of women‚Äôs movies have some cardboard cut out brooding dude, either rich or supernatural who is just as much a female wank fantasy as any side character in male movies is for men. That‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs not stereotyping an entire gender as stupid and wrong.

But even if what you were saying is true and portraying women as bimbos was wrong then why is it ok for men to be shown that way now? ‚ÄúSatire‚Äù? That‚Äôs a flimsy excuse. 
I mean I guess it‚Äôs fine for men to show women that way now if it‚Äôs fine for Barbie to do it and men should never have bothered to listen to women who said women should be portrayed better, because women want to portray men as idiots now.",2023-07-27

"Are you sure that is not a 2nd tier of manipulation?  In the beginning of the movie, the narrative stated ken only has a great day when barbie looks at him.  Ken was designed to love Barbie, and Barbie is given a final speech to Ken at end of the movie to call for a divorce.  Given how weak the Ken is, Barbie is literally brainwashing Ken to let her go.  It would be better ending for Barbie to build KenDom for Ken before she ditches him and leave for reality, than just brush him off with an empty speech.  I am not taking either sides, but the movie plot is gone rogue as Barbie just wants to be human, to be felt, to have feeling, to be kind, and be manipulative and selfish.",2023-07-27

the director shows us kens being bullied, getting refused invitations to hang out, being told to leave, owning no land, basically being eye candy props. and we are supposed to just feel for the barbies cause of ""sexism"" and ""patriarchy""

the mothers speech was really painful for me to listen to, that rallied the barbies together. like men dont feel the same way of the pressures of the world?

"Yes but in the context of Barbie land there are no kens on the Supreme Court ever so they‚Äôre just like women in the real world. That‚Äôs why it was hard for me to watch them getting rejected and getting a lesser role because as a women I related to them and to just be told they don‚Äôt deserve it was annoying.

That‚Äôs why the movie even compares it to women in real world which makes me more upset since it implies that women are like kens but we won‚Äôt give kens rights or power because they don‚Äôt deserve it. 

Also just because one group had to suffer doesn‚Äôt mean other do. Just like the college loan stuff but because other ppl were put in debt doesn‚Äôt mean we should now. Same point you are making with kens have to wait 100 years for no reason.",2023-07-22

"Ok so Barbies were in charge of everything because that‚Äôs just the way it was. They didn‚Äôt decide that themselves, they were made that way. So after forcing the Ken‚Äôs to confront their toxic masculinity instead of instituting a patriarchy, they went back to the way things were until Ken‚Äôs obviously were hoping for more representation. The Barbies decide to give them token representation and the joke is that they are doing the same thing as men in the real world because they don‚Äôt know any different. Ken‚Äôs feel this is a huge improvement and Barbies feel they are being more for equality but they are just repeating the same pattern humans have had for thousands of years. To me that is a joke about power and how if women were on top of the world for centuries, the roles would be reversed because we defer too much to tradition and how the way things are before very agonizingly slowly changing for the better.",2023-07-22
"A group of guys in their 20s exited the theater looking disappointed, like they were hoping the movie would have been more fun for their demographic

"You must not be very aware of feminist literature and studies because matriarchies are widely depicted as utopias or held in high regard (usually because they're more peaceful and non-violent).

But I'm not really trying to discuss matriarchies here.   
Again, my point is that the ken's breaking free from the barbie's control (the matriarchy) would be analogous to women breaking free from the patriarchy in the real world, assuming we're going with the satire angle. If the result was that the ken's ended up establishing their own control of the barbies in a unequal and unfair way as a result, then that paints feminist movements as problematic.",2023-07-24
The movie had a chance to critique feminist with the Barbieland matriarchy - it never really did. I just find it ridiculous that the Kens are supposedly in the real world womens place in Barbie land - yet when they get power they‚Äôre shown as not being worthy of it and totally incompetent and moronic. If you think that‚Äôs making most men reflect on being better and thinking about women‚Äôs position in the real world or whatever you‚Äôre dead wrong. A teenage boy leaving this movie would most likely just be pissed off that men have been shown to be idiots and not worthy of being in charge of anything and not in a good way that will help women.,2023-07-31
"Do feminists not claim ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù and ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù is holding men back from crying and showing emotion and being their true selves? 
Yes they do. Does Gerwig not try to potray that with Kens ending? Yes she does.
What part of that am I mistaken about?

Yes when you‚Äôre totally making stuff about men up based on what feminist women think, there tends to be an unlimited amount of strange theories. As many as feminists can imagine, I‚Äôm not disputing that. But what I‚Äôve described is the feminist ideology and ideas present in this specific movie.",2023-07-31

"Even though I loved it, for me the biggest ""flaw"" was that I found *that* the most interesting concept and it kind of gets forgotten for a large part of the movie's middle and only picks up again in that lovely ""now feel"" scene at the end.

The matriarchy vs patriarchy stuff is a lot of fun and arguably makes for a better ""Barbie movie"" concept (and for me Ken's song number is the unexpected highlight of the whole film) but the ""becoming a person"" and ""live forever as an ideal or die but live a real life"" choice is way more interesting. It reminded me of the movie Bicentennial Man.

Also, for a moment I thought the woman at the bus stop was a cameo by Barbie's real life creator, Ruth herself, then I remembered two scenes later that she died in the early 2000's.",2023-09-15
They were too into their own message. For the audience who is super into the message they might be able to overlook that this movie isn‚Äôt really that great and the plot doesn‚Äôt make much sense (why are Mattel chasing Barbie in Barbie land when they wanted to chase her back to Barbie land?),2023-07-24
I think they should have made the characters a lot more relatable and the message you're trying to give has to be subtle. Then the story becomes a lot more meaningful. This movie didn't do a good job at that imo.,2023-07-23

"You think those Barbies were being portrayed as ""the good guys"" for explicitly denying the Ken's a seat on the court?

In that scene, they were basically playing the antagonists from any historical 'female empowerment' movie, with the Kens being the ones fighting and gaining new rights.

"That's what I said. They ask the Kens to start from the lower levels which means that they do get a position of some kind. It's not a hard-no.

I found it to be a very realistic portrayal to be honest. If they'd have switched to an equal representation right after, it'd have taken away the essence of reality the film was constantly dabbling with.

In the real world, once you take back what was yours it's difficult to give it back / share it - especially when you're so used to operating with it in a particular fashion. The way I saw it was that the Barbies were willing to take a step towards equality. Their matriarchal ways possibly couldn't change overnight, so again them laughing after saying that line was a satirical jib at how it is in the real world - with the roles reversed ofcourse as you mentioned.

So now, Kens will have to work their ass off to prove themselves - the same way women have and sadly are still in the real world. Also it makes sense because let's be honest, Ken was created as a romantic interest for Barbie. 
Like he says in the film, it was never just Ken. It was always Barbie and Ken, so this plays perfectly well with that ethos too.

I hope we get a sequel titled Ken soon!!!",2023-07-23

They're just Ken. They only exist to be pretty companions to Barbie. Nothing more. Sound familiar? 

That's why the Kens in the movie are the way they are. Little girls playing with then based on their gender role expectation. It's something the film directly criticizes both women and men of.

When you played with Gi Joe's or Power Rangers or whatever action figures as a kid, how much enotional connection did you give to the female action figures? Or were they just there to be pretty and be companions and nothing else?",2023-08-02

It just felt so long and there wasn't really a lot of investment in her or her daughters character to care, they really felt like they were horseshoed into the script.  And I get the 2 weren't the point behind the speech, but it was just sudden and right at your face. It was jarring to say the least.

">I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt even like what the narrator said there

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the feeling the director was shooting for.

If you don't like the implications of that line, you should probably examine what part you can play in changing how those implications play out IRL.

If and when our real world is ever 'properly equal,' then by the movie's Barbieworld-is-mirroworld logic, the Kens will have a perfectly equal place in the legal system.",2023-07-25
">that didn‚Äôt end with Ken and Barbie not together

Ken realizing that he doesn't need to define himself things he has or by his partner probably the *biggest part* of the happy ending to his arc, and getting together with Barbie at the end would go against that point.

>I‚Äôll feeling about men even though it‚Äôs defended as a clever satire.

I'm a well-bearded dude, and at no point did I feel the movie was directing 'ill feelings at my kind.' If you felt like you were being badly portrayed, that *might* say something about character traits in the movie you identify with, and that *could be* worth examining further.

One major leg of the movie's themes is that men are *also* subject to conflicting expectations that can wreck them just as badly. 

The Kens were never *evil*, even when they were in control of Barbieworld- they were more-or-less just following along with what they felt they were *expected* to do 'in patriarchy' (of which they only ever had a surface level understanding brought back by Ken) - just the same as what the Barbies were doing. No Ken ever tied them down and subjected them to a brainwashing session or anything.

Things like the CEO turning out to be genuinely looking to put 'female empowerment over profits' despite all the earlier ""LOL, old rich guys caring about women yeah right"" jokes. Or him wanting to hug people more.

Or Ken realizing it was okay to let his emotions out and cry, or to *not* want to be 'in charge.' Those are a few examples of men in the movie breaking out of what they felt was expected of them by society as they understood it.",2023-07-25
"Ken and Barbie would have never gotten together. Ken has always been an extension of Barbie (an accessory of sorts) and to have them end up together would be antithetical to the very nature of Barbie.

Greta‚Äôs movies are incredibly feminist and that genuineness that you‚Äôd expect from her was sort of‚Ä¶missing in Barbie. The message is important, powerful and necessary, but the seeming lack of care in it‚Äôs delivery made it feel a little hollow. But I don‚Äôt at all blame Greta Gerwig, I more blame Mattel. Greta is better than what she served up here. She has a *much* more unique and powerful voice than this film would lead you to believe, and I truly believe that Mattel compromised the vision. And that *sucks*.",2023-07-25

"I feel like the point of that final Barbieland ""explicit No to equality"" scene was to setup the ""don't worry, the Kens will work hard and become equal to women's position IRL"" line.

If a watcher feels like women have a 100% equal place at the table, that line should indicate a perfect landing for Ken after the movie ends.

If a watcher feels like women IRL have a rawer deal than they'd like to see Ken end up with, then that's a probably conversation worth having, and I'm pretty convinced that's what the director was going for.",2023-07-25

"It [means](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop) whenever a character wakes up every day, being the same day. 

To be fair this is a bit of a variation of the original version (it's more like that they don't ""parse"" the issue, rather than being oblivious to the event happening in the first place) and you could technically count the time progressing, anyway there's not much of a point when you are living in an infinite utopia that resets and provides you with whatever need. 

Then, now that you make me think to it.. For as much as the paradoxes of [immortality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever) or of the [gilded cage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CagedBirdMetaphor) (or the even older allegory of the cave) barbie is living in her own ""fictitious dimension"". So, unlike your average Truman Burbank that resides in actual dirty reality, maybe you could imagine her world so overall perfect and pristine that there's not even a reason for her to ""doubt"" or assume there is more in the first place. 

But anyway, once you excuse the starting plot device.. it goes back to the usual trope: once you see the real (supposedly first-order) universe you don't want to go back to the accessory one. In this case there's possibly the metaphor between trophy wifeys happy to live in the shadow and at the dependence of their breadwinners instead of taking their life by the balls, but maybe I'm stretching the plot too much here.",2023-08-07

"I think it also was just a realistic touch. The Barbies went all out to get all the power. Why give it up? Women are human beings, just like men. It shows that people get so used to the status quo that even though they might have an inkling that something is wrong, in the end, it will take a lot more time for things to truly progress. So until then, the Kens would just be happy with some robes.",2023-08-08
True and I am sure there are more toy versions of Barbie than are ken but they were very loose with continuity in the film,2023-08-07
"I agree with your take. To me, it paralleled RBG's attack on gender discrimination when she was an attorney: she started by going after one (of the very, very few) laws that 'favored' women (a tax deduction for caregiving was not available for unmarried men). The government argued that MANY MANY laws differentiated between men and woman and allowed/mandated different treatment so how could this one little tax statute be unconstitutional? If it is, they all are!   
And the Court agreed with the government, in a way, even though RGB won the case. She used their list to systematically attack the unconstitutional laws.  


Anyway, I feel like Barbie was similar because it centered Ken/men and their experience at the end because it is the only way to get Ken/men to understand the unfairness. Similar to how you'll hear that a man wouldn't do X to women, because he wouldn't want someone to do X to HIS daughter/wife/mother/etc. Not treating a woman fairly because it is the right thing to do and that woman is her own whole person who deserves fairness - treating a woman fairly because that woman is some other man's daughter/etc. and no one wants their daughter/etc. treated unfairly. We have to make it ABOUT THEM because they don't care unless it touches them. It happens in other areas too - so a humanity issue? Not caring about parental leave policies until YOU have a kid, etc. Being anti-abortion until your 14 year old is pregnant, etc.  


I think I liked the movie for what it was and it seems like others wanted it to be a different movie/have a different message. But really, I'm not sure. I think it was well done. It made me cry. It make me laugh (""I'm a man without power; does that make me a woman?""). But it made me so deeply sad. Sad that it is a reflection of our world. A realistic one. Sad that this is the way things are. Sad about the backlash (also maybe a reason people are disappointed in it? Considering the backlash, I assumed it would have a more radical message) because some do consider it a radical message. I don't know. I need to think on it more.",2023-08-09

Barbie continually steam rolled Ken‚Äôs need for validation and independence. At no point in the beginning did she ever encourage him to find himself. She led him on because of the attention  and had no intention on sharing any aspect of her life or power in society with him. 

Reverse the genders and you get men who treat women as long distance low commitment girlfriends. Ken only acted the same way Barbie treated him ‚Äî boys night every night was an example of that.

The whole point is that no one should be compromising their individual autonomy to be someone‚Äôs accessory ‚Äî which tends to happen in very patriarchal (and in Barbie lands case matriarchal) societies.

I felt the whole message of the movie was to try to make people see that we still have a long way to go with the patriarchy and that the real goal isn‚Äôt a matriarchy (which Ben Shapiros small brain thinks is the end goal) but rather a system with equal opportunities for both.",2023-07-23

I took it as choosing to end on a joke that's supposed to make the audience think a bit about the deeper implications of 'same position as women' having *any kind* of negative connotation to it at all.

You just can‚Äôt imagine that this movie isn‚Äôt very good, people who don‚Äôt like it do understand it and some people want really want it to be genius because ‚Äúomg it‚Äôs Greta Gerwigs feminist Barbie‚Äù, when in reality it‚Äôs badly written.

">Which is wrong.  They gave them *less* power than women have in the real world.  The Ken's are 1 step above where they were before, but where they were before were literally not even people.  

How do you figure they were ""not even people""? 

>There are 4 women on the Supreme Court, and one has been on it for 40 years.  Barbieland is a shadow of the US, not Saudi Arabia.

Hmmm... let's see. The Supreme Court was first instated back in 1789. The first woman was appointed 200 years later (!), in 1980, even though they were being considered as early as the 1930s. There have been what, 115-117 Supreme Court justices in history? About 107 of those were white men. 
So, considering the Kens just started being considered for positions of power, I'd say the portrayal is pretty accurate. I'm sure a Ken will be appointed to the Supreme Court in the next 50 years or so. Too bad there hasn't been a female president, though... I guess Kens will have to wait a bit longer for that.",2023-07-31

The main barbie came back to ken land and got the same treatment that kens had been getting since barbieland was a thing. This, as said by other people, is a direct call out to the real world, kind of saying that men would break down into tears If the were treated like women are. 

But like, does it have to be that way? Did the barbies really have to take the worst possible approach to this and just say ""because you treated us badly, instead of resolving our issues now that we know how it feels to be treated like that, we will now treat you badly""",2023-07-31

And ken kept ignoring her constant no‚Äôs to continue to try to date her.

In the real world, the tantrums over being told ‚Äúno‚Äù turn into physical violence far too often (anytime is too often). 

So no, this isn‚Äôt for you. It‚Äôs about an experience women have on the regular of having to manage the emotions of men who can‚Äôt handle being rejected romantically. 

It‚Äôs not for you.",2023-07-30
"That's not the message of the movie at all. I see you commenting all over this thread with your bad take and your bad analogy and people keep telling you it's wrong. Maybe try genuinely understanding what people are telling you and why you are so personally upset about it.   

A big issue with gender issues nowadays is 100% the fact that women are breaking the chain of the old gender roles and redefining themselves. And men push back (see the rise of Andrew Tate and similar harmful preachers). The movie (and real life) encourages men, who are now unbalanced due to the lack of role in social settings, to find a new way of being, new role models, not defined by their connection to women.  

Barbies in Barbieland at the beginning of the movie do not care for Kens. Kens are just there, Barbies are living their best lives with their sisters and don't bother with Kens that much (which is not nice, mind you, but it makes sense because as a child you played with Barbies, and you probably had that one lonely Ken and that's it - something you would know if you had experienced that in your life).   

As soon as Kens take over, they sexualize Barbies and want them around to feel as foils and mirrors of their existence. Kens are also supposedly living their best lives, but that includes humiliating Barbies and keeping them around as glorified pets for their egos.   The crux of gender roles is in that obsession. Can't you just find your place in the world and leave us alone? We do just fine without you. 

This is not insulting or offensive. This is what women had to do with every wave of feminism, fight to become their own independent entity that wasn't tied by law or by norm to their fathers, bothers, husbands. This is not being anti-men. This is world history relying on the subjugation of women that happened and it's still happening in non-Western countries. It's life, it's real.    

I am sure you guys can find a minute or two to think about everything, find a bit of empathy within yourselves, and realise that being asked (by a toy movie not catered for you) to stop defining your whole sense of worth on the mirror provided by women is the way to go.",2023-07-30
"The Barbies aren‚Äôt smarter than the Kens; no one in Barbieland is ‚Äòsmart.‚Äô It‚Äôs about power and lack thereof. The real-life doll‚Äôs existence informs the Barbieland dynamic of Barbie being ‚Äòeverything‚Äô and Ken essentially just existing as an accessory for her.

It‚Äôs a reversal of the Adam & Eve myth, which takes places in a fantasy land every bit as imaginary as Barbieland, yet has been used as justification of real women‚Äôs supposed inferiority for centuries. You root for the Barbies not because gender-based oppression is good, but because it‚Äôs cathartic to see that inverse of the reality we all live with.

Some barbies come with a dog which is kind of the same. The little girl is still projecting herself onto her doll, not onto any of the other stuff.

Like Will Ferrel CEO and execs had general evil guy vibes but there was no clear threat. The only thing they did was want to put Barbie in a box which would send her back to Barbieland. Instead she runs away, bumps into mother and daughter and they travel back to Barbieland‚Ä¶",2023-07-24

"I wouldn't say Barbie is the villain. She is a product of her environment as have been all people in history. Both Barbie and Ken were entirely unaware of any ethical issues within their society until they were confronted with new information. Both of them drew faulty conclusion based on this new information and, while Ken overcorrected, Barbie tried to reverse everything to the previous status quo. Then, to patch the newly developed disconnect, Barbie agreed to implement incremental changes to this status quo.

Nearly every significant social revolution follows a similar pattern. Most of the time the oppressed or wronged groups don't manage to stage full-on governmental revolutions, but they often try to overcorrect the social wrongs, are then met by strong counter movements by the establishment and finally are being granted small but successive improvements.

Nobody has to be evil in this. It's just how humans work.",2023-07-27

Protip: if you want your ""important"" message to be not just be heard but taken seriously, you cannot be preachy about it. No one likes it, especially the people you're trying to change. Otherwise, you're just preaching to the choir. If anything, it's counter productive.",2023-08-01
"Interesting that you say that, since both Kens and Barbies are portrayed as morons ONLY after forgetting who they were. There was nothing wrong with anyone before that, and the movie never implies it. 


No one asked the Kens to change who they were before or to change how they were acting, they were the ones who decided to change after they thought they were not enough. (Hence the I‚Äôm Kenough hoodie at the end). They explain this in different ways throughout the entire movie, the only thing he wanted was the attention. He gets this confused with the desire of also being respected and validated, when the whole time he wanted attention, but ONLY from Barbie. This was clearly explained at the beginning ‚ÄúBarbie has a great day every day, but Ken only has a great day if Barbie looks at him.‚Äù He gets impressed by things he likes (clothes, cars, horses) when he arrives in the real world, but his innocence combined with misinformation leads him to think the ONLY way of getting Barbie‚Äôs attention and being respected, is by acting like a moron. So he changes everything about himself. A couple of examples:

‚ÄúWhen I found out the patriarchy wasn‚Äôt about horses I kind of lost interest‚Äù - he only liked the horses. But he thought horses+having sexy girls bringing you beer and treating them poorly were tied in together. (This is a common trope of toxic masculinity, not a diss of men in general). Barbie never actually disrespects him, she is very clear with him from the beginning ‚Äúyou can go now, because I don‚Äôt want you here it‚Äôs girls night‚Äù (and yes she could‚Äôve given some time to Ken any other day, she admits to that because also not Barbie is portrayed as always good).

‚ÄúEveryone respected me, a lady even asked for the time‚Äù - he starts wearing watches because he feels the more watches he wears the most important he is (this is funny not because he‚Äôs depicted as stupid, but because EVERYONE looses themselves when they think something, like an accessory, will get you attention from someone). The Barbies even forget who they were when they start acting different for someone else instead of being themselves. ‚ÄúI would never wear these clothes‚Äù.

The mini fridge and the flashy clothes also fall into this category, Ken explains he doesn‚Äôt even like most of the things he thought he wanted, he even cries about this! And even when crying he thinks he‚Äôs not supposed to show any emotions, ever. Leads him to the realization of, wait I am ok because Ken is Ken.

Then you have the discontinued toys and weird Barbie and Allan. None of them loose sight or sense of who they are, or start acting differently, because they know who they are and they accept this.

"It portrays all male characters and Kens as doofuses who need correcting in their ways. The whole message to men isn‚Äôt even one they need, it‚Äôs one feminist women have decided they need. Men on the whole don‚Äôt get their entire self worth from women any more than women do. It‚Äôs natural to derive some self worth from your partner or family if that is what you want out of life.

The whole positive message to men is you can cry more and find yourself and you don‚Äôt need to attach yourself to women for self worth. Problem is that‚Äôs not actually something 95% of men care about and they have no desire to cry more or whatever. Feminist women have just decided that men care about that and it‚Äôs bothering them, even though actually they don‚Äôt care at all for the most part. And that message is presented in a movie where all men are morons. So it‚Äôs a condescending message for men men don‚Äôt even need delivered in a package which insults them.

Even a small side character who had nothing to do with sexism like Gloria‚Äôs husband is mocked for no real reason. I think one excersise to do to find out if something is sexist and bigoted is to reverse the genders and see if it‚Äôs acceptable. Would a male heroic character who mocked his wife learning a language and then laughed about some cooler old girlfriend be seen as a good guy, would that go unnoticed?

"I've got to disagree with you again here, I think it's great that it was Ken who had to do the self discovery to realize it's not the validation of others or 'Barbie' that makes him who he is and thus powerful. Because the root of patriarchy and toxic masculinity stems from men, so it should be Ken who goes on that journey to liberate himself from whatever causes him to want barbie's validation so much. We feel that Ken's journey overshadows Barbie's because his one is easier to relate to on the surface level.

For Barbie however, her own issue's are a bit more nuanced and forces viewers to accept that sometimes, it's okay to just be you, and the characters throughout the film repeatedly tell barbie she doesn't need to be 'someone' because she's perfect the way she is. Her personal issue was that she didn't know who she was if she wasn't 'someone', so she quite literally went on a journey to discover what that is. It's harder for viewers to relate to this because most of us wont even touch on the surface level of 'who am I/what is my purpose'.

Ken's character benefits from being the comedic juxtaposition to Barbie's turmoil. We pan between scenes of Barbie discovering the real world in a serious way, then to Ken enjoying the benefits of being a man in the real world. We instantly see Ken as the funny part of the film and it carries through right until the end, so we end up rooting for him more than the main character. This is pretty common in any film with a comedic side character so it's understandable that a lot of people feel the same way as you did.",2023-07-22

"Our main character literally chooses the real world over Barbieland at the end of the movie. That means something.

Barbieland is framed as a utopia at the beginning of the movie because we are seeing it through Barbie's eyes. She's on top, of course everything looks fantastic.

"The Barbies are the ""bad guys"" in the same way that men in real life are the ""bad guys"". They exist in a system that prioritized them. Even if they do want equality, they aren't gonna just give half of all positions to the oppressed gender. They're just gonna give them the opportunities to earn it.

When women were allowed to have more power in the judicial system, they didn't just give half the Supreme Court seats to women, instead they let women *be* judges in the first place, and let them work their way up, just like the men did. Is that how to fix inequality? No. Not really, because they aren't acknowledging that women start at a disadvantage in the first place. But that's how progress works in the real world. Anything else would seem unfair on the surface level. I mean, look at how people react to affirmative action and diversity hires. 

*That's* why the patriarchy is so insidious and hard to let go of, even though a lot of men do want equality between the sexes. The point is that you can't undo inequality overnight, even with good intentions. It's meant to be satire.  I don't think you're suppose to idolize Barbieland, you're meant to see it as a mirror to the real world. That's why the narrator explicitly said that one day the Kens will have the same rights that women have in the real world.",2023-08-02

"I think that's the thing I can't stop chewing on. The movie does a pretty good job of showing how patriarchy doesn't just damage women, it can hurt men as well. Two things that come to mind Allan continuing to be disrespected, and Gosling Ken admitting that he did t even like the position he put himself in (he just liked horses) but he felt the burden of maintaining the role created by patriarchy I thought were both interesting issues to shine a light on. But even though it goes out of the way to show how the women/empower people are hurt by it, they don't show how the women/empowered people understand the issues of the men/non-empowered people. Which...I know it doesn't have to, but it seems like the movie went out of its way to set up that payoff and then it didn't. If that's a deliberate choice, I don't quite understand it.

Idk, it just felt like *too much* of a downer ending. I wasnt surprised by a morally complex ending - Barbie trying to figure out what her life should be and being told ""reality kinda sucks for women TBH"" gels with what I expected going in. But it kinda feels like nobody aside from Robbie-Barbie learned anything. Gosling-Ken learned a bit about self actualization I guess (loved his shirt at the end that said ""I am Kenough"") but I didn't really buy into how he got there.

"Please there is no movie which portrays the entire female gender as badly as the Barbie one does for men. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs satire‚Äù is a pretty convenient excuse for what is simply a continuation of the tired sitcom trope of men dumb and women smart and done in this film in a particularly mean spirited way.

There is nothing wrong with with casting women or men as simple plot devices in a movie intended for the opposite gender. Sure as hell a lot of films women like like those Jane Austen adaptions or 50 shades or Twilight all feature the same basic broody rich or supernatural guy with the same basic personality. It‚Äôs not about the Lens being sidelined - it‚Äôs about the awful portrayal of all men in this film - not just the Kens but the real world as well. 

Marilyn Monroe is one person playing a character types - there Albane been loads of dumb male characters as well ala Homer Simpson. But saying the way she was portrayed gives women the permission to portray men badly 60 years later for satire is a pretty flimsy excuse.

This movie does to men what 40‚Äôs racist cartoons does to black people and turns them into a twisted stereotype of a strawman to rag on. Well I guess men now know that it‚Äôs fine to go back to potraying women as complete bimbos or mocking them since it‚Äôs apparently fine for women to do that to them and then call it satire.",2023-07-26

Yeah I guess you could say for the most part they all are sorta because they have a good arc of learning to be yourself.

I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre asking if they treat men like they do in ghostbusters 2016 and yeah unfortunately they do treat them as stupid a lot.

"> directors and writers shouldn't use a film as a vessel or vehicle to spout a direct message

Why on Earth not? Directors and writers have been doing that since the invention of movies, and playwrights have been doing it for thousands of years, although they often couldn't *directly* express their message due to censorship.

If you want an example from 80+ years ago of a film being used as a vehicle to express a direct message, try The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin. It doesn't get more direct or unashamed than this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7GY1Xg6X20

A number of countries around the world banned the film. England had originally banned it, but by the time it was released they had gone to war with Germany so the film was allowed. 

For the record I haven't seen Barbie and have zero interest in it. But the idea that directors and writers shouldn't be political or express overt social messages in their movies is preposterous.",2023-11-16
Lmao eat shit dumbass,2023-11-05
"the blatant overexaggeration of the film wasn't too on the nose, it's like satire.

Take the movie bottoms, came out recently if you've watched it, basically it's this high school where two girls accidentally start a fight club. Anyway, this school basically worships the football club, whenever there's a pep rally or football game the captain comes out, some girl is screaming eat my pussy! There are posters with him on it and ""horny"" written in the middle. The captains sidekick type guy is threatened by the girls fight club because he thinks it'll ""take attention"" away from the football game. Spoiler alert: at the end, the fight club girls literally murder all the members of an opposing football team because they were trying to murder the captain with pineapple juice. There are way more examples in this movie.
Anyway, the difference between bottoms and barbie is that barbie had a real message, and bottoms was just mindless fun. Both were an exaggeration of current social situations; high schools loving football, women always having to live up to unrealistic expectations. 
And it is real, you say ""supposed patriarchy"" as if it's fake? It shouldn't have to be explained that even after women got suffrage and jobs and laws passed so that discrimination wasn't allowed, sexism still exists. 
The complaint that it's too on the nose may be true for me, a woman who understands that a lot of the things stated in the movie were completely obvious, but it's obviously still needed if people are still talking about patriarchy like it's fake.",2023-11-11
"When I asked if you were serious I actually meant this part of your original comment:

>	Since when was it acceptable for directors and producers to use movies as a blatant attempt at political and social enlightenment? That movie was ridiculous‚Ä¶

Since when is it acceptable? Do you not realize how fucking stupid that sounds? Movies are made about transforming robots, superheroes all kinds, wizards, completely fictional everything, historical events, and ‚Äúbased on a true story‚Äù but you find it unacceptable for a movie to make a blatant attempt at political and social enlightenment? That‚Äôs the dumbest fucking thing I‚Äôve read in quite some time. Acceptable to who? If you don‚Äôt want to see a film with a political message then don‚Äôt fucking see it. Simple as that. 

But then, to justify your ignorant-as-shit rant, you focus on one tiny shot from one scene? Yeah of course construction workers wouldn‚Äôt be so blatant about their catcalling. Sure, it‚Äôs unlikely as shit that someone would smack a woman on the ass like that. Oh, and by the way, no she wouldn‚Äôt have been arrested for that, nor would Ken. But did you cry about that part being inaccurate? Nope. Just decided to rant about women not being construction workers because they don‚Äôt like the work not because of the patriarchy. 

Let me ask you, are you a construction worker? Do you know this to be true for sure or is this just your opinion? Because I happen to work in construction. I design fire sprinkler systems and have spent hundreds of hours on job sites. You know what happens to women in construction? They get treated like shit. The few women who do work construction jobs, whether on-site or in-office, have inappropriate comments said to them constantly, get harrassed non-stop, and generally have to deal with tons of shit that men don‚Äôt, and perpetuated by men. And women who work in construction offices tend to be constantly tested whether they belong there. That‚Äôs pretty standard for women anywhere in a professional environment that is male-dominated. 

But hey, you go back to watching movies about totally believable things like time travel and keep fuming about movies with a political theme and totally unbelievable scenes like men sexually harassing women, because that kind of thing neeeeeeeever happens. Ever.",2023-11-06
">For one; that DOESN'T FUCKING happen in the real world.

Lol. What bubble do you live in??

>Women are perfectly within their right to apply for construction positions. But they don't. It's not because of a ""patriarchy"" - it's because, well, they just don't apply for those hard labor jobs. Gosh gee golly, who could have possibly thought that would be the cause.

Oh. That bubble. Lol.",2023-11-21
"Let me guess, you're a guy...?",2023-11-12
"I think the movie is very self-aware that it is a representation, and it makes layered commentary. The structure of the world in the movie as I saw it was that the ""real world"" was also a caricature and over the top, not just the barbie world. But that doesn't mean that those caricatures don't have a relationship with truth, just like actual caricatures highlight real features and make them appear ridiculous, so does the movie highlight them in a ridiculous fashion. So you are entirely correct that the situation with the construction workers does not generally speaking occur that literally, but cat calling and sexual verbal remarks still does happen.

On top of that, I think the movie is actually criticizing the kind of feminism you are against. So in a certain sense I think you and Gerwig are on the same team here. And for what it's worth, I too found it very uncomfortable how Kens were represented at the beginning of the movie. But that was the point. The barbie world was just the opposite of a caricature of a patriarchy (Sasha legitimately calls it out as  fascist). But even so, it bares resemblances to how real world exists in the exact opposite way. Women are often side candy in movies. I personally found it interesting to experience the uncomfortable feeling, exaggurated as it was, that no doubt many women feel when they play games or watch movies where women are just there for the men.

So if there was a ""message"" in relation to this, it was that the kind of barbie feminism really is just not very feministic, while it still recognized that it at least was some kind of step up from all women being reduced to moms when playing with dolls (and in real life). The whole starting scene with the 2001 reference and the music is an over the top darmatisation of what occurred in 1950's looking at it now. It was a dramatic change at the time, but looking at it now it appears as the whole thing was great big farce about a miniscule step forward. Just as the opening scene.

So to sum it up, I think Gerwig agrees with you that the way Kens are treated in the movie is problematic, and I think she is making the point that this kind of feminism is a problem. That ultimately it is just patriarchy reversed.

tldr; hold off the barbie bbq for now, fellas",2023-11-07
Actually it is a stretch. A stretch of fantasy and seeing what you want to see.,2023-07-26
"I think the way the male characters are treated aligns with bell hooks and radical feminism. Hooks is really compassionate, and real, in her approach to men. She argues that in discussing and understanding men, we can help redefine manhood in way that is constructive and not just ""man hating."" 

Ken sought to oppress and control Barbie. He was wrong. The Barbies eventually regained what was theirs, but along the way they taught the Ken's how to achieve self-realization. Ken said it himself when he first took over - he was respected for just being a dude. This is pretty big for men. Real quick, water under the bridge, I understand this is worse for women - I'm not trying to argue otherwise. But anyway, among men, this feeling that we're only worth what we can provide isn't rare. I do think there is a bit of a role reversal as well, but I think this is also to help people empathize. So to show compassion towards someone who tried to oppress you is bold and radical.

Along the lines of radical theory - the justice portrayed was Transformative Justice. It wasn't punitive. Barbie helped Ken grow, but she also learned that Ken lashed out because he felt hurt. So they began to change their community. That's what Transformative Justice is - changing the conditions and environment so the person who committed harm doesn't harm again. 

I can see the point about the mom/daughter relationship. I didn't mind too much. I was more pleased that it was more about the mom's boredom and dissatisfaction with motherhood and less about her being a great mom. I feel like what fixed their relationship was the daughter seeing her as a person and not just a mom.

Honestly though, I feel like there is so much to it so I'm sorry if I get carried away or unclear. I was just talking to my fiance about Greta, and she mentioned how she's very good at presenting flawed characters who you just need to accept - like life. I thought the ending took this even further. The world can't be ""fixed."" Part of being human is learning to cope with it, and still seeing the beauty in it.

But like I said, I think there's a lot here and so much conversation to be had so sorry if it's hard to follow. I can try again later to expand what I think if it helps.",2023-07-23
"Yeah, and that's a problem with men. Patriarchy is the status quo, and under patriarchy ""emotional maturity"" isn't really the fastest way to power.

The stuff bell hooks pushes isn't anything your average therapist wouldn't recommend either - it's just emotional maturity.The point isn't literally ""men need to cry more,"" it's men need to be in tune with reality and their emotions. I've been in AA-style meetings for abusive men. Half of them claimed they WOULD NEVER hit a woman - it wasn't manly. Yet after decades of repressing their frustration towards some aspect of their lives, they would snap and throttle their wives. One time is all it takes to land you in that meeting. Yet they all swore they did nothing wrong. A more conservative approach would be zero tolerance - cancel culture, throw them in jail! The more progressive approach, a la hooks and Gerwig is to show compassion and help men develop a fuller, healthier understanding of themselves. I guess it's up to you to decide what you prefer. For what it's worth, in speaking of issues relating to men, hooks is the only person I've read that was actually concerned about men - violence towards them, their quality of life, etc.

"Ken and barbie aren‚Äôt perfect allegories for men and women, and that is also not the point of the film.

You seem to think that the Barbies = women and the Kens = men, and that Barbieland  is just an inverted version of our world.

You‚Äôre complicating the images of these dolls, that is toys made in the image of men and women, with real men and women. That is not the allegory the film is built on. 

The allegory is Ken and Barbie needing figure  out ‚Äúwhat they were made for‚Äù beyond the ‚Äòroles‚Äô Mattel printed on their boxes, because living within those roles is unfeasible. Just as real men and women need to figure out their identities beyond their genders, because defining oneself under either gender is limiting and harmful to both. 

Barbie is a more accurate allegory of women in the film because she is a toy made by a women, in the image of women, to be played with by women.

Ken isn‚Äôt, because by the logic of the film,  he is still ultimately only the image of a man as played with by young girls. So while Ken does at various points very clearly and intentionally intersect with the actions  of real world men, he‚Äôs not meant to come anywhere near as close to a one to one allegory of men in reality in the way that Barbie is of women in reality. 

Barbies journey from Barbieland to the real world is quite explicitly an allegory for a girls journey from childhood into Womanhood.

However, Ken is obviously not an allegory for real men, nor is he an allegory for the journey of boyhood to manhood. 

Because Ken is at once a representation of the toxic and limiting effects of masculinity and the patriarchy on real men, AND a direct allegory for real world women AND a depiction of women on film. 

Ken fills  the role of vapid pretty love interest that women have played  with little nuance for the majority of cinemas existence. 

It‚Äôs not that Barbieland is an inversion of our world, but that Ken is actually an allegory for real world women. 

Yes obviously the satire comes from its appearance as a inversion. But that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs actually happening. 

The Kens live in a society stacked against them despite making up 50% of the population. Where they have limited power, rights and influence and are treated as pretty but ultimately superfluous objects. 

People keep saying they had hoped for a warmer ending to the film where their society has reached true equality. But the Kens can‚Äôt reach true equality by the end because they represent real women and real women have not reached true equality. That‚Äôs the point.

The same fate is offered to the Kens as has been offered to real women: a path toward equality. Not because men deserve to see the shoe on the other foot, or the film being about revenge, but because Ken is literally an allegory for women, and women were not handed equality over night. 

The films grounded in the look of the early 60s , alongside Barbies creation. There wasn‚Äôt a female Supreme Court justice until the 80s, so it stands to reason that in 20 years a Ken will be made a supreme court justice, and in another 20 years they‚Äôll be 4  Kens severing on the Supreme Court and 2 retired. Because that is the rate of progress in the real world and Barbieland influences our would as much as ours does Barbieland. So who knows when they‚Äôll be a Ken president? We‚Äôll know before they do. 

Yes it is a shitty ending, but it‚Äôs also half the populations present lived reality.",2023-07-23

For example, Barbie has never officially married Ken or had children (to my knowledge) and this could have been brought up when facing Gloria's issues. Maybe just stating that Barbie couldn't address these issues but still comforting Gloria would have been good? More empathy perhaps? Or acknowledging the comfort in that Barbie can't be everything to women - she can't be a mother, married, have an ambitious career, plus whatever else you can throw at her and because of that Gloria might have to find a new role model or find some inner strength to combat these issues? Not saying that Gloria used Barbie as a sterotype to live up to, I know that she was primarily using Barbie as a comforting concept to understand her own issues through her drawings and as a way to remember her daughter as a child.

"Yes, I understand what they were trying to convey, I just felt like it didn't work super well in the context of the movie.

The Kens weren't particularly despicable; they were like children, na√Øve and misguided, none of them actually harbored any ill will towards the Barbies. Even Ryan's Ken says he lost interest in the patriarchy after he found out it had nothing to do with horses. All the Kens wanted was to find meaning in a world that wasn't made for them, something that I think most of the movie's viewers (assuming it's girls and women) can identify with. It just feels like punching down in this situation and the only moral ground they have to stand on is that they're the opposite gender.

I think if the Mattel CEOs were the focus of the conflict and played as a little more sleazy or went a harder on the love bombing then they would've been better targets for manipulation. Even if it parodies their public image too much, it might've worked better structurally for the movie, and as long as Will Ferrell's character learns a lesson at the end of it it can still paint Mattel's image in a good light.

">There‚Äôs no actual ‚Äúmisandry‚Äù involved in conveying this, it‚Äôs quite literally just a genderbent story of equal rights that ends with everyone deciding they should live their lives freely of how they were initially designed.

You're joking, right?

The movie demonized a huge number of benign activities as manifestations of toxic masculinity / ""The Patriarchy"", like watching action movies, exercising, and horses. Like, wtf? How is liking horses toxic? All of these traditionally ""masculine"" activities are being construed as guilty by association, as if men oppress women, so anything men like is also oppressive and bad. 

The message seems to be, ""Don't follow culture, just be yourself. But if you're a man and you like anything stereotypically associated with masculinity, this is by default toxic and bad"". So it doesn't leave men with any clues or any direction, except a nebulous sentiment that you shouldn't do anything unless Barbie approves of it, which actually is misandrist. The film seems to embrace the ""men are defective women"" trope, which is definitionally misandrist. 

Then there's the fact that every single man in the entire film, without exception, was portrayed as inherently dumb, morally weak, and some combination of crudely sexist, proudly selfish, and joyously oppressive.

There wasn't a single positive male role model in the entire movie, and no hint of a suggestion of what positive healthy masculinity looks like.

Those that were structurally powerful admitting that the structure was unfair, but reluctant to surrender control of that power - again, like our world - is a message as well. That's not an endorsement; it's satire.

It's also about how our abstract ideas are shaped by our messy reality and vice versa. Barbie didn't bring full female empowerment to the real world; a more nuanced worldview and the complex inner life of real women didn't bring full Kenquality to their world, either.",2023-07-23

"I don't think men sat around and decided to start a patriarchy, and I don't think men today even consciously try to uphold it. But men as a monolith were sure as hell bigger and stronger than women, and took what they wanted at the start of civilization. When that's the base of what we are now, yeah, things are going to be skewed in men's favor, and men (in general) aren't going to question it, because it feels like the natural order of things. Do you think women came up with all of the rules (to be clear, I'm talking here about actual rules) that dehumanized them throughout history? Women decided periods were dirty, so they had to be locked away for a week every month? Women decided to be passed off like cattle for trade? Women feel that our beauty and ability to be nice and accommodating are the most important things that we can offer, because thousands of years have told us that this is true. This is historically how you get the man you want, rather than the one who you hate, but your dad told you you have to marry. That's how it's been for most of human history, and women today either still live in those exact conditions, or if they're lucky they are still unlearning those rules, so they can just be comfortable with themselves.

This isn't to say that women do not participate in the patriarchy, and uphold misogynistic values. Most of the shaming women experience in motherhood for instance, comes from other women who think they know better. But there is often a lot of pressure in the female experience to be ""just so"" lest we turn off men. So when women explode with frustration about the double standards we experience, that frustration is often directed at men (unfairly or not), because we know other women are going through the exact same thing.

So I think the other redditor got frustrated, because saying ""men go through the same thing"" is kind of a ""what about the men"" statement, and isn't really relevant to that scene. It's a scene of a woman talking to a woman about the female experience. Men don't really come into play there, even if they do have, as you very thoughtfully quoted, their own tightrope to walk.

For why Barbie chose to be human: one of her biggest struggles throughout is that she's just normal, standard Barbie. In some ways, she has the same problem as Ken, who has no profession. He's just ""beach."" She feels powerless in her own ""perfect"" society. Feeling a lack of purpose is a very human experience, so she decides to be human. In the moment leading up to that decision, she's more human than any other Barbie has ever been. It's something I personally struggle with all the time, and that scene absolutely made me cry. There is something beautiful and deeply touching about giving yourself the freedom to stop thinking about what you want to be when you grow up, and how you're going to change the world (and lets face it, probably feeling like you're failing) and decide to just be human. It was a very subtext heavy plot though, so I could understand if it didn't come across to everyone.",2023-07-28

"I've mentioned this in other comments, but that part is used to demonize everything else that men do/like as bad or guilty by association.

The men are depicted as oppressing women and liking horses, and because oppressing women is bad, that means liking horses is also bad.

There's a double standard here, because in the beginning, the Barbies were oppressing the Kens (which is, you know, presumably bad), but that wasn't really explicitly described as bad, and nothing else that the Barbies did was implied to be bad either. Just all the things the Kens did were described as bad, except for being quiet obedient accessories for their Barbies. 

The messaging was just very confused and unnuanced.",2023-07-23
"How else are you supposed to interpret the activities the Kens did during the Kendom?

They didn't watch action movies and drink beer and talk about horses (wtf is up with this? it's so random) before the Kendom, they only did it during while they were also brainwashing and oppressing the Barbies, and when they were put in their place and told to change for the better, the action movie watching and the beer drinking, etc., were toned down. Then, when Barbie is telling Ken that he needs to follow himself, and not a toxic culture, to find his place, she's literally talking about all the stereotypical behaviors the Kens participated in earlier.

The movie *explicitly* links male-popular activities and toxic behaviors. The direct, unambiguous, *not even allegorical or symbolic but quite literal* message is that these activities are all part of the same constellation of male toxicity that includes oppressing women and establishing a mono-gender government (which the Barbies also had/have, but it's good when they do it? The messaging is inconsistent.).

I'm still suspicious that there's some satire here that I'm missing, but no one is pointing out where the movie also lampoons women's struggle (it actually takes itself quite seriously in that regard), so where's the satire supposed to come in?",2023-07-23
What‚Äôs wrong with talking about what you‚Äôre passionate about?,2023-07-23
"Yes. The idea here is that, when men are free to act as they please (""The Patriarchy""), they immediately oppress women and then party and do all kinds of stereotypical male behaviors.

The male behaviors like watching action movies and liking horses (wtf? Is this even masculine? is it even toxic?? makes no sense) are made guilty by association.

Men oppress women, and men like horses (??), and oppressing women is bad so horses are bad too.

For fuck's sake, the conclusion of Ken's storyline is that he should just be himself and not what culture dictates a man should be, which was the whole point of including all those stereotypical masculine activities in the first place.

The problem is that those activities aren't inherently bad or sexist, but they're being conflated as such. Men engaging in culturally stereotypically masculine activities was explicitly demonized as merely an aspect of ""The Patriarchy"", and the end of the movie directly implied that they'd be happier if they found other interests, presumably something the Barbies would approve of, but it's never explicitly clarified. The message for men is ""What you're doing is bad. Stop."" but there's no clarification on what isn't bad. The best we get is what the Kens are doing before BarbieLand becomes Kendom Land or whatever, which is basically being neutered domesticated pets for the Barbies. That's obviously not a solution for men in the real world. The movie doesn't give any direction to men in the real world, it just tears them down and says ""do better"" with no further direction. 

This is just a high-budget display of the ""men are defective women"" trope.",2023-07-23
"Why is it disingenuous that a Barbie movie based on a child‚Äôs toy of all things doesn‚Äôt focus on a gender war? Why is it a good thing to get boys and girls at each others throats by insulting one of them and telling the other they need to overcome their oppression? Is that really going to be a positive thing?

The opening sequence is making a PR point for Mattel that makes them look good in the current day, you realise that right? Barbie wasn‚Äôt the first doll of an adult woman, she just became the most popular and mass produced and she didn‚Äôt have any kind of job in her first few iterations, then she had jobs like teachers assistant and nurse - the astronaut doll was a novelty joke because space was so hot a topic in the mid 60‚Äôs. It wasn‚Äôt this serious message like people are pretending now. Feminists literally protested the doll throughout the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. But Mattel had Tik tok feminists convinced Barbie is some seminal figure in women‚Äôs rights which is hilarious.

The entire story surrounding Barbies creation is largely fabricated to make Mattel look better and more progressive. Ruth Handler had a basic idea to copy a sexualised German doll which already existed and a guy called Jack Ryan designed Barbie, it was even named after his wife. Ironically for all the talk of patriarchy it was actually Handler who was ruthless about taking all the credit and downplaying his contribution. And funnily enough the men at the company originally wouldn‚Äôt create the Barbie doll because they thought having a bombshell bimbo doll was offensive and gave the wrong message to young girls to try to live up to that. That is until Jack Ryan who loved the idea of the doll looking like a 50‚Äôs bombshell because he was a sex maniac got on board and pushed for it. And that‚Äôs why Barbie had pointy tits and curves at first. Because some pervy mad men style dude thought it looked hot.

There‚Äôs your real story of a doll created for female empowerment.

"Greta Gerwig has openly stated multiple times that that is EXACTLY what she was doing though? It's not an assumption, it is what the writer herself said before the movie even had a trailer. You not seeing it for what it actually is doesn't mean it was hard to understand, it means you had a preconceived idea of what the movie would be and interpreted it to match your bias. It wasn't to tell men it's ok to cry, it was to hold a mirror up to the ways that toxic masculinity hurts men but is still not taken seriously by a lot of people.

Also, if rambo did such a good job, how come 40 years later men still haven't got the message?

I laughed because i was happy for ken and found him oddly endearing as he discovered that he was Kenough. I laughed because him misunderstanding barbie comforting him was so painfully accurate to life, but in that moment it was definitely more of a 'fml' laugh than a 'haha lol' laugh.

Important to remember that Barbie Land is a female fantasy land. Barbie isn't dismissive. It's her reality, just as human men accept their reality being in charge. Kens don't have any real role. Barbie tells Ken to find his role. Not something that can be handed to him or to anyone.

I dont want a franchise to end here and now, and yes I liked the film, just dont want it to be an endgame here.

"Agree with you - there are some pieces missing.

One point towards it being a production issue: Ken isn‚Äôt treated as a predator or illegitimate in his romantic intentions, even when he tries to kiss Barbie. He‚Äôs treated as naive and misplacing his affections, and Barbie doesn‚Äôt scorn him, she relates, she has a boundary, she pushes him towards helping himself out. I don‚Äôt think that would be in the film if the origins were singularly female focused.

Stallone being an influence for Kens was also not fully explored, and played as a joke, but there is a very real connection between Rambo/Rocky/others and body image. The 80s action star did a lot to market hyper masculine identities that Ken is adopting. I assume there was a better link to masculine identity through that and it‚Äôs easy to overlook because we only see the comedy side of it.

I think a lot of people will probably misconstrue my read. I‚Äôm not angry at the film, and I understand the parallels between the two worlds. I just think it was inconsistent in some areas which made it appear needlessly isolating. Literally all they needed to do to soften it was be like ‚ÄòIf being in a pink mansion with a little car and a dog that poops everywhere is you, go for it. If being yourself is being into photoshop and trucks and boxing, you do you, whether you‚Äôre a Barbie or a Ken. You don‚Äôt have to rely on what society wants from you or what you‚Äôve always done before, follow what you believe in, and discover who you are.‚Äô 

That‚Äôs a coherent message of self-worth that still retains a positive note for women, which is also consistent with the themes of the story, and validates every character (and viewer). Instead we have a mishmash of light comedy and iconoclasm that leans more one way than another, and imo weakened the script.

Yes I realise that Gerwig probably thought she was doing something very clever with showing how the patriarchy and toxic masculinity hurts men too by showing Ken crying and getting to find himself - but in reality that‚Äôs not something men actually care about - it‚Äôs something feminist women claim men care about then claim the patriarchy is stopping them from doing and then other feminist women agree. But most men don‚Äôt care at all. That will only resonate with feminist women.

It‚Äôs just weird that the patriarchy in the real world and Barbie land is portrayed so negatively yet the Barbie matriarchy isn‚Äôt - if they wanted to contrast the two then they needed to show that as just as bad otherwise the message is just that women should be in charge because they‚Äôre better.",2023-07-21

"The movie doesn't lean on men at all, unless you believe ""expectations"" are in turn to be expected from one.

Having your V-hole checked isn't a ""shocking joke"" because it's gross - but because on the complete opposite it's supposed to be (and I quote somebody else in this thread) ""maybe the most prosaic, mundane, uncomfortable-but-unremarkable aspect of being a woman.""

Similarly there was no continuous replacement of ""target"" in the movie message. It was just one constant logical and emotional build-up about why women feel trapped. It's not just the glass ceiling, media representation, or whatever other ""long shot"" disparity.. the great majority of life subsume an implicit social contract (which was summed up perfectly in the big monologue at the weird barbie house). If you come out of the shower and just dress with a hoodie and jeans, nobody absolutely gives a fuck - if a girl does the same, she's probably assumed to be a drug addict. Similarly, while there are probably many manly and rad synonyms for when somebody is a ""playboy"", the tamest one I could think for the other gender behaving the same is *slut* (and even then, only with younger kids today.. which to be fair do probably have some actual chances of walking around all these ingrained conventions, but nonetheless even them have to interface with older ""wife bad"" generations)

Last but not least I'm not sure what crying at the end of the movie should say about women (I mean, it's pretty much a given that the finale of any drama will have a big dropping emotional scene?), but as a guy that cannot cry even when thinking alone to the big dread of existence my eyes were surely getting very slippery around 10 minutes before the credits.",2023-08-07

What if men don‚Äôt need or get a lot out of talking about feelings like women do? Who are feminist women to say that way is wrong and their way is right? Why on earth would they have the moral authority on how another gender should act in relation to their own feelings? Don‚Äôt they hate that when men do it to them?

">my views down to political alignment because they don't suit you is really telling of the divisive kind of society we live in today, rather than to be able to have real discussions about things we have

I apologize for my initial comment! I threw out that assumption not based on not liking the movie through political reasons, but from my knowledge (not just  specifically Barbie), movies with a political vendetta or biased alignment seem to be judged from a different lens than an unbiased one by a more vocal minority. I would consider myself to be pretty moderate, my assumption wasn't exactly stating you were a hard conservative, but rather have a different reason to view the movie in a different light than you'd view another movie, so for that, I do apologize for the assumption.

As for the statement on complexity and such, it was definitely a jab. I don't think it was mostly to shame you, but rather, the points you made on masculinity and your use of the words ""main plot"" seemed like your initial comment completely missed what the movie was about. I don't think anyone could have watched that and left thinking the main plot should have been repairing the rift, it was a part of the plot but definitely not the main.

Like some of your critiques were about character development and characters being unlikable, but I don't think a movie should even be worried about having their characters liked; especially in a comedy such as this. Just because a character arc or development was simple, it doesn't mean it wasn't executed well. From what I've seen, the movie gets its main purpose across which brought laughter to plenty, did great numbers, and was probably one of the better comedies that was released this year.

"> the Barbie matriarchy is competent and has its shit together

Not really? Barbieland is a world of toxic positivity. You could slightly edit the scenes and it would appear dystopic. (Also the movie implies‚Äîactually it almost explicitly confesses‚Äîit's a fantasyland constructed by how children perceive the world, remember how in the opening number Barbie doesn't have to use stairs she just magically appears places?)

Barbie thinks *one time* about death and suddenly she has to go on some epic journey to ""fix"" that? That is self-destructive delusion. It's 1984-level double plus ungood.",2023-07-25
Yeah no matter how I see it this was definitely a man bashing film even when they tried to male female equal bullshit.,2023-07-23
"The Kens are a commentary on the negative effects patriarchy has on men, and the way it makes men behave. Ken's whole character arc about being unable to properly express his feelings and defining himself by his job and his partner? That's all part of the movie's criticism of patriarchy. The Kens turning into egotistical chauvinists? That's commentary on the role patriarchy expects men to play.

The Barbie Movie is one of the few pieces of media I've seen that really engages with how the patriarchy hurts men, too, and it's baffling that the movie is being accused of hating men.",2023-07-23
"Still, I'd rather be dependent on a job than a husband. Less risky. And there are other ways to make money once u Actually have your own money. And not all are miserable in their corporate jobs. At least my employer gives me money that I myself have full control over üòÖ. And also WFH when I want, maximum 40hr/week, great salary, paid vacation etc. The good thing about a job, is that you can quite easily change it if you're unhappy with it. You are also not as emotionally attached to an employer as you are to a husband. At least there is no financial abuse and risk of physical abuse and manipulation. Your employer probably won't stalk you and threaten you if you leave. You probably don't have kids together with ur employer. Why am I even stating the obvious hereüòÖ.",2023-07-23

"Ok - I forgot weird Barbie and that was a well conceived character so I will admit she should be included as a good character. I don‚Äôt agree with the others being interesting though.

Was Barbie spouting intellectual feminist jargon really some awesome ‚Äúmeta joke‚Äù? Or was it just bad writing and Gerwig wanted to make characters her mouthpieces at the expense of character continuity? Seems like excusing anything that makes no sense as a ‚Äúmeta joke‚Äù is just that - an excuse.

All those jokes at the Barbies expense are light hearted and often physical comedy. The one constant joke at the Kens and Mens expense is that they are dumb. There‚Äôs a difference.",2023-07-26

So what Ken steals show? It‚Äôs the Barbie movie. She can‚Äôt even be the main character is the ultimate irony of this ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù movie. I think the writers knew Barbie wasn‚Äôt compelling and they spent more time making Ken the well rounded character.",2023-07-24
">Is Sasha a bully?

I mean, yeah, that's the whole point of the little girl character, to convey that information to the audience. The film doesn't really have the screentime to dwell on it, but yeah Sasha has a reputation at her school for being a bully. Which is probably a sign that she's deeply unhappy and its coming from a place of insecurity/body image issues, which is why she's so pissed at Barbie. That was my read on it anyway. It also mirrors her mother's unhappiness, and gives both of them an emotional connection to Barbie that better ties them to Barbie's story, in which they are really just side characters.",2023-07-28
"It definitely moves fast and swings a bit so I can understand that. It didn‚Äôt bother me at all because I was so engrossed.

I‚Äôm just repeating myself at this point but that‚Äôs my answer to your question.",2023-07-22
"Take a look at their line. Yeah there may be different colours but it stops right about there. They have ""curvy"" which still looks like 80% of women never will. What kind of message that sends? There is doctor and other high professions. And there is the trophy wife type. Where is the average? The 9-5 office worker? The shop assistant etc... so no. in general they are still all about the, for many, impossible goal.

Set women back 50 years? No. Not in the way the movie meant. Do they have a bad effect on mental health? Yes. Why? Precisely because they set an impossible goal which if little girls growing up don't reach they feel like a failure. 

We could argue about body positivity for example and that fat isn't healthy. No it isn't. Does someone fat deserve to be treated by society by as a subhuman? No. Does that treatment come from impossibly set beauty ideals starting from small girls' toys? Yes.  
So overall, I do think there was and is a negative effect.

"I felt like that metaphor went over so many peoples heads. Ken‚Äôs comment about not owning a house and it being Barbies house ‚Äî welcome to every woman‚Äôs experience in the real world in 1950 and prior. Ken is trying to show men in a lighthearted way ‚Äî what it‚Äôs like to live in a patriarchal society ‚Äî but it‚Äôs through a matriarchal society ‚Äî just genders flipped

Barbie owed Ken an apology. Barbie treated Ken horribly. Reverse the genders ‚Äî which they do during the kendom part ‚Äî and it‚Äôs jerk behavior.",2023-07-23
"Sure but being hurt because someone didn't return your affection doesn't mean you take over their house and generally act like a douchebag either.

Edit:
I'm trying to say that Ken's behaviour wasn't great either and in the end Barbie is the only one apologising when her crime was basically not loving Ken back. This justifies his revenge on Barbie and I guess this didn't sit well with me because of the very real issue of women rejecting men and in some cases paying for it, even with their lives.",2023-07-23
"Yeah I thought the message was clear: Barbie was righting the wrongs she saw in the real world. She understood that women's suffering in the real world was wrong. She realized Barbie's were doing the same thing to Ken's, and apologized for that treatment, and for being an active part of a society where Ken's self worth was attached to pleasing Barbie.

That's why the denial of the ken's to be on the supreme court/be a part of government was a conclusion that missed the mark. Still loved the movie though",2023-07-23
"OK I didn't really like this movie overall, it was alright, but mostly I was disappointed it didn't live up to the hype. 

However to your point, Gloria's monologue about the contradictions in what makes a perfect woman: Be smart, play dumb, be a mom, but have a career, be attractive, but don't flaunt it, be ambitious and a go getter, but be caring and don't hurt anyone's feelings.

You can't figure out how the Kens are supposed to be, because the expectations on them are the same as women in real life. We want them to stay in their place and not upset the Barbies, yet we also want them to have more depth, more intelligence, but not too much, not too demanding, we want them to have more agency, but not to grab the power off the Barbies. 

For the Barbies to be happy they have to be in charge. There is no equality the the Kens. Because that's just not how things are done around here. They actually don't have a good reason for not aiming for equality other than fear of loss of their own power.

It was mostly Gosling's Ken who was played for the idiot, the rest of the Kens were just living with less power. But in history women were not even allowed a full education because we were deemed not intelligent enough for it. The media portrayal of men being stupid generally is a kind of petty revenge, but in a movie about feminism it was to be expected. Being denied education in the real world because you are ""not intelligent enough"" is not something I can ever see happening to men. It's supposed to make people uncomfortable. It made me uncomfortable and I'm female, but men have done that to women in far more real ways than just media portrayal, and that's the point. If the movie wasn't about feminism then this portrayal would be unfounded, but it's trying to make you think. I have a lot of gripe with the execution of it, but I can see the reasoning.",2023-07-25
"The movie ends with Barbie apologizing to ken and empowering him to be his own person, and the Barbie's say they don't want things to go back to the way things were, and start to work towards equality in Barbieland. It's right there in the movie.",2023-07-25
That was exactly my thought lol.,2023-07-25
"I think the fact that the battle ended up a dance battle that turned into a co-op dance scene was really good progression. I do think a solo Ken movie where he can find himself in an anti-patriarchal comfort of positive masculinity would be really amazing.

But yea, the movie is about Barbie. I get how cinematically there was space to further resolve Ken stuff, but it‚Äôs not women‚Äôs jobs to fix men",2023-07-29
"The movie was not about Ken. The movie was about Barbie. The thinking they ""missed that"" is you missing the point by a mile.

Why would they make half the movie about men when part of the theme is that women often have very little to do with the plot of films, whether as a driving character and are mainly treated as accessories to men's lives.",2023-07-29

Also, Ruth Handler stated that Barbie and Ken will never get married, which Mattel has honoured.

Many critiques of the Barbie Movie arise due to lacking knowledge of the Barbie lore and canon. I think it is possible to enjoy the movie without that knowledge, similar to enjoying a random Marvel movie without having watched the previous films, but it is immaculate with the background knowledge.

"Nah, there's several others (albeit some that are more nuanced than explicitly called out):

\- Ken's conversion to ""total patriarchy a\*\*hole"" only happens because he felt undervalued and found instances in the real world that validated him, and then he started reading about all the horse stuff, which led to more and more until ""Kenland"". (a parallel to figures like Andrew Tate and the like validating young men).

All this to say, men aren't ""inherently bad"" like feminism may sometimes frame them to be, and that's different than the ""patriarchy"" itself, as we understand it today.

\- Similarly, it's admitted that Barbie was stringing him along with the whole ""every night is girl's night"" thing. (And also wasn't upfront with him overall until the end).

\- The whole ""post-cry"" point of ""be your own person"". If the cry itself is that only thing you focus on, then that's a bit weird, imo, lol.

\- A super smaller point (cause I'm not 100% it was effective in doing so), but just showing men in more effeminate positions in the movie (like the big dance scene), \*does\* help men who enjoy conventionally unmanly things, even in 2023.

There might be a few others scattered around, but ""pro-men"" themes aren't just things that pat dudes on the back. Not sure what else you could be looking for.",2023-07-21
Dudes not being pitted against one-another anymore (because the patriarchy has been defeated) is fairly pro-men tbh.,2023-07-21
You walked into the point and still missed it. Yes the Kens are treated badly because BarbieLand is a matriarchy. It's not trying to counter one extremism with another. It's pointing out how ridiculously and unjust misogyny has been by portraying a misandrist society.,2023-07-24

Even in a so called ""patriarchy"", women are more comfortable, protected and well-off as a whole than men and men are doing what women expect of them.

"It‚Äôs a movie at the end of the day, Gerwig made stylistic choices and the movie had a comedic undertone, the choice to make all the Ken‚Äôs kind of a joke was not to be taken as a literal description of real men. 

To your point about wanting more examples from the beginning of the movie, as a woman it didn‚Äôt take much imagination to picture a world consistent with the real world that instead valued women more than men. You needing more examples to understand is a result of you being a man in a patriarchal world! Which again, is the point of the movie. 

I appreciate the honest discourse around this and my comments aren‚Äôt to be taken as an attack, I just hope you can understand that women who watch this movie seem to all get the point immediately, whereas men need an extra minute at the end to think about it.

"You seem to be struggling to understand the themes of the film and Ken‚Äôs arc in particular so I‚Äôm copying part of another comment I made explaining it, I hope this helps.

Ken arguably has just as big of a character arc and journey of self discovery as Barbie does. He starts off as an accessory to Barbie, his only purpose in life is to be near her. In the real world, he learns about patriarchy and loves the idea of a society where men (and horses) are powerful and in charge. He goes back to barbie land to turn it into a patriarchy but it still doesn‚Äôt make him happy. Instead of defining himself as Barbie‚Äôs boyfriend, now he defines himself by his house and his car and his clothes and possessions. All he wants in life is a sense of identity and to feel needed and wanted and powerful but instead, the system that he himself has put in place holds him back and imposes strict roles on him that he doesn‚Äôt really want. He only becomes truly happy when he starts looking inward to define and accept himself for who he is as a person and realises that he‚Äôs Kenough.

There‚Äôs a really sweet message in there about how society hinders men from living as their authentic selves because of the roles we as a society place on men as well as women. All too often men are defined by how much money they make and how many beautiful women they have around them instead of who they are as human beings. The whole Andrew Tate idea of hyper masculinity encourages men to be as shallow and materialistic as possible and then blames women for expecting them to be rich alpha males.

If you‚Äôre upset by the end of the movie where the kens make some social progress but still get treated as second class citizens with less power than the barbies, good. That‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôa a deliberate mirror to how women are treated in society today; progress has been made but there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do.

The message of the movie isn‚Äôt ‚Äòmen bad, women good‚Äô, it‚Äôs that humanity is complicated and messy and we put systems in place that harm us all.",2023-07-23

\- The actual production of the Barbies and how that fits into the real word- Why anyone in that world actually cares if the Barbies leave Barbie Land

"You missed the point.

What you call an ""emotional manipulation scene"", the rest of us call a ""realistic portrayal of the truth of gender power dynamics"".  

So you wanted the Barbie's and Ken's to come together in equality? Well that isn't realistic. Women have been able to vote for 100 years and yet still only make up 27% of Congress.  But the point isn't that we should strive for equality because that isn't very realistic. Instead, the message is we shouldn't be dicks to one another and it's going to take us men to stop being so defensive about ourselves and learn the thing that women have had to learn on their own -that we are okay just the way we are and we'll be okay if and when we're no longer in power.",2023-07-23

"My perception of him was different for two reasons.

1. The driving bit was not about implying that the husband was lesser for not being a crazy driver, it was about Gloria not wanting to have the ""I had other lovers before your father"" conversation with her pre-teen daugter in the middle of a car chase.

2. The ""that's cultural appropriation"" comment from the daughter is not meant to be accepted at face value, just like we don't accept Barbie's a fascist because the daughter called her one. Gerwig's showing a very real modern archetype of a preteen girl who is passionate about social justice, but doesn't quite yet understand the context of the causes she's championing.

"Personally, I feel like the line at the end is more to point out the hypocrisy of the Barbie in charge, though. Like ""yeah, we want equality for you, but not so fast"", not a ""No, you shall not be in charge because you suck"". 

>That‚Äôs not to mention the movies depiction of the Kens totally wanting to take over Barbieland and make all the Barbie‚Äôs objects with no thought for their own.

The movies depict the Kens as wanting to be appreciated, recognised and being acknowledged as important, and taking over Barbieland helps them do that because that's the only way they learn. I think there is a clear distinction between portraying them as having ""evil"" intentions and doing evil because that's the only mean for equality in Barbieland they have ever known, but ofc it's subject to interpretation. I think you just need to look at Ryan's Ken entire character arc, which was very consistent in this depiction, the joy he got and his emphasis was never about he can ""bully"" Barbie around, it was because he is appreciated, valued, he can be important, he can have fun by himself and with the boys, and he no longer needs to be just an auxiliary to Barbie, who obviously mistreated him and took him for granted.

The men in the real world are kinda caricatures though, and I agree that is one thing the movie can be attacked on. Some people are just a bit too zealous to attack anyone who has a different opinions on the movie, even though many of them are totally valid. (Though I think the movie also really does suffer from mean spirited attacks by people who are upset by anything with feminism inside as well).",2023-07-31
"Ken definitely has a character arc. He learns to show emotion, and the power of men supporting eachother emotionally. He also learns that his value isn't tied to ""masculine"" things such as whether girls (Barbie) are attracted to him or not.

It's funny you're upset that the Kens were stupid and easily manipulated when the movie shows all the dolls to be easily manipulated. The Barbies are equally manipulated into accepting Ken's patriarchy after he visits the real world. What saves Barbieland is a human who manages to ""deprogram"" the Barbies.

The movie plays with gender roles and Barbieland is a gender flip of the real world where men hold most positions of power. The irony of the ending where Barbie returns to power and only allows Ken minor positions of power is intended. It reflects the real world where women have fought for a long time and usually only get to take small steps forward at a time.

Finally: even if the main message of the movie were simply about women's empowerment, why would that be a bad thing?",2023-07-26
"Is it really necessary for men to have a character arc in the barbie movie? The joke of the ending that went over your head is that it IS a horrible ending for Ken, because as the movie puts it: they're finally on par with women in the real world",2023-07-26
"It doesn‚Äôt really glorify a matriarchy. Yes it definitely bashes the patriarchy heavily throughout the film, but the whole thing is satirical anyway. Barbie‚Äôs not happy at the end when the Barbie Land issue gets ‚Äúresolved‚Äù, and in fact the movie even states that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt get an ending‚Äù. What I think Gerwig is trying to say here is that: the return to matriarchy, with the beginnings of the Ken suffragette movement, is not the endpoint. It‚Äôs the beginning of change. 

I would say if you come away thinking that any entrenched gender imbalance is good, then that‚Äôs a very surface-level analysis of the film. The commentary on the real world patriarchy is done to set up a juxtaposition with the Barbie Land matriarchy. We spend the whole film talking about how male power imbalance is awful; but rightly, the same arguments apply to female power imbalance too. Barbie is not happy by the end. She, as the stereotypical Barbie, rejects this completely. 

I would say the absurdity of Barbie Land is the same as the absurdity of men in the real world thinking gender equality is achieved. It‚Äôs completely ludicrous and disillusioning‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs the point. If you‚Äôre put off by that, good. That‚Äôs how a lot of women feel about the real world. 

Ken even makes what I think is a pivotal comment near the end of the second act, something to the effect of, ‚Äúnow you know how it feels‚Äù. The Kens takeover makes Barbie feel awful. But likewise, the Kens have always felt awful in Barbie Land. Any system with entrenched gender imbalances makes the powerless feel pathetic, infantilised and ignored.",2023-07-21
">It‚Äôs got a really heavy handed political message though. It‚Äôs not just a comedy.

No, it's not a heavy handed political message. I just watched it and thought it was light hearted fun. I also don't watch 24/7 news and I have not heard anything about the movie prior to seeing it. I'm suspecting someone else told you to feel this way.

>Is it good to tell girls that the real world is so horrible for them when really being a women is a western country is pretty damn good.

This isn't a movie for girls. It's a movie for women. It's not telling girls anything, it's pg-13. And there are still problems being a woman in the real world, even I was sexually assaulted by a manager in my first. Oh, when he was confronted by 5 of us,

Maybe you don't interview or apply for jobs as well. Nobody cares about whether you were top of the class when you get a job. Sounds like you are having a 'you' problem trying to get past an interview and looking for something else to blame but yourself.

I really think you are taking this as super serious and it's really not. Lighten up some and it will probably help with your other endeavors like getting a job too.

"Ken's story is a pretty basic, if not literal, analogy for a lot of young boys today and the insecurity and challenges they face by the standards society puts on them, namely how a guys self worth is directly tied to his ability to get the girl. Honestly, if the men going their own way subreddit was honest about its intentions (before they got banned for the blatant misogyny), they'd be fawning over Ken's storyline. He:

1) was introduced as nothing but a dude who's obsessed with Barbie and wants to be her boyfriend


2) all the other kens fight each other for Barbie's attention. Twice, once in the beginning and once at the finale, because they value the themselves based on their relationship with Barbie


3) Ken's insecurities weren't resolved and that lead him down a path of toxic masculinity, which leads him to find superficial confidence and a false sense of belonging and began performing acts of violence against women both domestically( turned all the barbies into bimbo servants) and legislatively (rewriting the constitution). Clear analogies for both the domestic and legislative harm that occurs when insecure men begin taking their rage out on the women they based their self worth on, like the Dobbs ruling and its fallout. He even says that all he ever wanted was for Barbie to accept him, and he had his whole life turned around by the one time one girl gave him a compliment, something many people on this very website will state is one of the more difficult aspects of being a young boy. the Ken's obsession with Barbie is also what led to their downfall because they still couldn't just be themselves

"It really is a devious trap for the ""pro-men"" movement.  

If you're upset at the portrayal of men in this movie well have I got news for you, dude!",2023-07-23
"Everyone got it. It‚Äôs not subtle. The problem is when you portray the kens as idiots and the barbies much smarter and the real world women as sympathetic and smart battling agains the dumb bad patriarchy it is an clearly uneven portrayal which makes it look like the movie is saying women in charge are better and mens struggles are a joke.
If the writers had of put aside there need to portray all mens real or Ken as idiots and made some of the women and barbies as more obviously bad or dumb the way the men were portrayed,  it would have been a good point made - but as they couldn‚Äôt get over their bitterness toward men it isn‚Äôt.
And obviously they wouldn‚Äôt make Barbie be a villain of her own movie which was why this plot wasn‚Äôt able to make that point. Or perhaps Gerwig just really feels women are better than men Idk.

Also the thing that‚Äôs confusing and sending mixed messaging is that Ken is the equivalent of women in the real world in Barbie Land yet he is also representing some kind of patriachy/incel role - so because they tried to do it both ways it just comes off as making a joke of men while treating womens real world struggle against patriarchy as some great thing. You can‚Äôt have it both ways.

The writing wasn‚Äôt good. They tried to make Ken represent too many things and the point was lost. But that‚Äôs what happens when you put idiology over character cohesion. Feminist talking points were made but the message of the actual movie was muddied.",2023-07-23
"Good points. 

I guess I still don't have an issue with it because it was used as a good device to create the upside-down power dynamic in Barbieland and the political commentary from that. 

You can disagree, that's cool. But I don't think it makes sense to be upset that they didn't accurately portray history so that the men were made to look like fools in the Barbie movie... like, what would you expect? But whatever.

"Idk man, clearly you are dead set on seeing what you want to see in this movie. I'm a man and I wasn't offended by it or anything. It's definitely a feminist movie but I don't think the main takeaway should be or is supposed to be ""all men are dumb and bad haha"". 

They definitely mocked male stereotypes, but every ""negative"" depiction of men in this film, I felt, was based in at least some reality and was humorous. We all know the guitar douche or the guy who has to over explain every movie. It's funny because it's relatable. 

 It's absolutely a ""girl power"" film but I seriously doubt Gerwig's intent was to offend or insult men, or turn women against them.

I will say I wish they had fleshed out the Ken storyline a bit more and given them some more depth, but I'm almost certain this movie will get a sequel and maybe we'll see that then. Either way I didn't feel like this movie was some kind of attack on men.",2023-07-23

"The point is that Barbie can‚Äôt solve sexism. Barbie was revolutionary in championing women‚Äôs aspersions and goals outside of the home. Barbie was an astronaut before a woman every went to space. She has been a president before any woman was. She owned a home before anti-discrimination laws were implemented to prevent married women from being denied a mortgage. 

Conversely, Barbie has also been heavily criticized for being perfect, creating unrealistic beauty expectations, and using ‚Äúgirlboss‚Äù feminism to sell dolls. Barbie, despite all her attributes, cannot solve feminism. The entire movie was predicated on the Barbies‚Äô false belief that their existence solved sexism (at least for women). 

It would be hypocritical for the movie to then turn around and say ‚Äúokay, Barbie didn‚Äôt fix sexism before but now she has‚Äù. To me, the ending showed that Barbie can have both negative and positive effects on sexism. America Ferrara‚Äôs character speaks to the contradictions women face in her speech, the same is true for Barbie as a pop culture icon. She had been heavily criticized by progressives and conservatives. She is a problematic fave. So isn‚Äôt it fitting that the solution the imperfect Barbies come up with is identical to solution us imperfect humans have come to? An ending in which sexism is solved would have been hollow and contradictory to the thesis of the film.",2023-07-26
"There is a difference between making fun of men and depicting Ken as he exists in the broader Barbie lore and canon. Ken was literally created as an accessory to Barbie. Almost no one owned a Ken unless they also owned a Barbie. He was not created to be played with on his own. This is the Ken depicted in the Barbie movie. The Ken characters in Barbieland‚Äôs existence is predicated on Barbie. (Perhaps an interesting contrast to the Judeo-Christian belief that women were created to be men‚Äôs helpers re: Adam and Eve). 

The Kens‚Äô solution was to usurp the Barbies‚Äô power and subvert it. They explicitly aimed to replace the matriarchy with the patriarchy. Initially, the Barbies wanted things to ‚Äúgo back to normal‚Äù (Make Barbieland Great Again, so to speak). But they realized that absolute power harms everyone - Barbie acknowledging it is tough making all the decisions. Instead, they provided the Kens with some autonomy, albeit, not complete equality. 

The movie quips that, like women, the Kens had to work for it. However, if you look at the initial issue: the Barbies‚Äô belief that their existence had ended sexism, it would be hypocritical for the film‚Äôs resolution to be that Barbie initially did not end sexism, but now it did. This ending would feel hollow. Instead, the underlying message is that Barbie, as a cultural icon, has promoted female empower (ex. Astronaut Barbie was created before a woman ever went to space), and regressed feminism (unrealistic beauty standards/striving for perfection). Barbie is not equipped to solve sexism. Barbie, like women, like humans, is contradictory (re. America Ferrera‚Äôs speech to the Barbies).",2023-07-26

It is different for someone to continually talk about a book they love that you would or have never read, and someone explaining a book to you after you‚Äôve read it because they assume you did not understand it.",2023-07-26

"Totally respect your opinion, hate the fact that people use downvotes to try scrub comments they don't agree with.

I didn't see the message as ""haha men=bad"", I can see how you saw it that way, but I saw it more as making fun of behaviours that are typically shown by men that are patronising or boast inequality. 

When you say that ""some lines are unrealistic"" can you think of some off the top of your head? I didn't have that idea when I was watching it.
I also think that it was designed to make some people feel uncomfortable while watching, which is the point. I personally felt a little attacked by some of the behaviours in the movie which I saw myself doing, and I welcome that because now I can be more aware of that and hopefully make other people less uncomfortable in the future

Overall if you saw the movie as bashing on all men, then you might need to challenge the way you see men, men can still be masculine without the toxic derogatory traits seen in the movie. I don't think the movie was bashing on men, just the problematic behaviours and mindsets most commonly seen in men.

"Yeah, I feel like they got 99% of the way there but in the end Barbie had almost no character growth. Almost feels like the moral of the story is if you don't want the lower class to rebel give them just enough power and a sliver of hope that they can succeed so they'll keep orderly while you hold the real power.

Ken's plotline felt much more cohesive. He starts out placing all of his worth in the approval of a single person. Then learns he can just have everything his way through ""patriarchy"" and goes overboard in order to give Barbie a taste of how he felt. Then realizes that doing that doesn't actually make him feel better. He ends learning a lesson about how he treats others and how he views himself. He is kenough.",2023-08-01
"Late to the thread, but that was the whole point. Barbieland is a matriarchy and had always been run as one, the Ken's have even less power than women in the real-world. They don't have homes or identities outside of Barbie. 

You don't over-turn years of disenfranchisement with a few nice speeches and people believing things should be better. It would have been a naive message to say that everything will immediately be better.

It is a direct parallel to real-world progress as women have slowly gained more positions in society. The movie even shows the Kens being excited and happy with the explicitly unequal compensation they were given. In the same way how in the real-world we celebrate women gaining minor steps forward towards equality. For instance, it is seen as an achievement that women now make up ~1/4th of the US Congress, the highest amount in the nation's history. While at the same time, many people will claim that women are fully equal in the US.",2023-08-22
"Because they are leaving Kens in the same place women are right now in reality, it's even outright stated this way. So it's actually quite a bold political statement in the end, because Barbie world is a fiction, but women's still unequal reality is not.",2023-07-25

"For what it‚Äôs worth, I think it‚Äôs just sort of a foregone conclusion that MR is getting nominated for Best Actress. You‚Äôre correct that she was nothing short of amazing in this film. And it‚Äôs not like she hasn‚Äôt turned in other incredible performances, but this one is just next level. It‚Äôs too early to know who will ultimately be nominated but I‚Äôd be shocked if she‚Äôs not a front runner which is in and of itself astounding for a female lead in a comedy.

I think the other commenter you replied to is correct in that RG is getting talked about so much because a mostly comedic turn is just way easier to explain what you liked about it and comment on in a social media post than the much more complicated role that MR had to pull off. And of course on a male-dominated space like r/movies, comments about him will get the majority of the attention (hmm, wonder if there‚Äôs a recent movie that dives into this topic lol). It‚Äôs just easier for people to do the Anchorman thing where they just quote one of his hilarious lines about patriarchy and it gets sent to the top.

RG mostly just had to nail the himbo role (not easy, to be fair and I could totally see him getting a much deserved Best Supporting nom). And while he had some moments of serious weight, it‚Äôs not even close to the balancing act MR had to pull off. She had to be funny, believably perfect as a Barbie, believably imperfect as a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù Barbie, carry the majority of the emotionally weighted scenes (although special shout-out to AF for nailing the Gerwig monologue about what society demands of women) and basically just tie this entire thing together and she did it with aplomb. The movie would be worse if RG wasn‚Äôt in it but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs completely irreplaceable in his role. I can‚Äôt think of a single other actor other than MR who could have made Barbie work to the extent that it did. Major props to her and GG.",2023-07-23

Expecting that crowd to have media literacy isn‚Äôt worthwhile. It‚Äôs why they fall for right wing propaganda so easily.

"Agreed. During the first half of the film I empathized with Ken and felt for his situation. His entire purpose is just to be a sidekick to Barbie and he never gets to do the things he wants or have any ambitions of his own other than be ""just Ken"". My takeaway was definitely that the film wanted to say that both the original Barbieland and the Kendom were flawed, because they both heavily favored one part of the population. Thus, Ken's arc felt both believable and ended on a great note.",2023-07-23

"Totally agree. I was hoping they‚Äôd go deeper into a few of these themes. The design choices they made gave solid subtext, then they‚Äôd say something very basic like AI writing a Barbie-critical tweet. Collectively it was good but didn‚Äôt quite scratch the itch I was hoping to get.",2023-07-21
The daughter is speaking hyperbolically by saying it sent feminism back 50 years - but there is absolutely no questioning that there is a well established record of feminist groups critiquing Barbie for perpetuating unrealistic body images since the 1970s. There‚Äôs an entire section on the Barbie wiki page dedicated just to this.,2023-07-23

"Yeahhhh there was a lot I loved about this movie, but there was a lot that was weird. Maybe it's because I spend a lot of time talking to women, but it felt very weird to have America Ferrera just kind of explode into what felt like a series of obvious complaints about being a woman in the real world. Then even weirder when saying those things to women who were programmed was treated like the solution that just fixed them instantly. It wasn't weird that the next step in Barbieland was to trick the men into having a beach off until they realized they really did all love each other... 

But it was kind of weird how the movie sidestepped addressing what the solution is for the real world. The movie just kind of yells at men and women who buy into the patriarchy and hopes they'll realize how silly and destructive it all is. I'm not saying it needed to actually solve these things, but it asked big questions before going into a really trippy and bizarre metaphysical question of what it means to be a real person instead of a plastic doll, punctuated by the question of whether or not Barbie has a vagina now. It just left me feeling really weird.",2023-07-24

"Toxic masculinity: emotional stoicism instead of emotional openness, general homophobia attached to any male emotion or connection, women viewed as sexual conquests instead of human beings, women viewed as lesser thans who belong in the home and belong *to* men, physical strength and career earnings viewed as more important than developing an actual personality and interests, going to the gym instead of going to therapy, men in positions of power abusing that power and exploiting the power imbalance they have over others (and creating a system that mostly covers up or facilitates their crimes/wrongdoings), men in power making political and legal decisions about women's bodies with barely any female input, male dominated government bodies, unrealistic body standards for both men and women (and permitting or encouraging shaming of those who don't measure up) etc...

That's not to say that there weren't things Barbieland was doing wrong before Ken brought back patriarchy. It actually goes to show that where inequality exists, things like patriarchy or matriarchy will flourish, for the worst. That's why Barbie tries to empower Ken in his own right, by saying he doesn't need to do all that macho shit to try to lock her down or impress her, he should just learn to be himself. Like Allen. There's a reason Allen doesn't like either Kendom or Barbieland and the Allens continually escape. He's looking for actual equality.",2023-08-06
"A big part of the movie is that these societies create internal strife by defining people in terms of profession, possessions, and relationships. Even when Ken institutes the patriarchy it's ultimately unsatisfying for him because even though society's perception of his value has increased, he's still basing his self-assessment of worth on things that aren't him, but are just things he has. The end of the movie is him accepting that he's not Beach Ken or Barbie's Boyfriend, but is his own self-actualized person with a self-worth that's unconnected to his relationships or profession.",2023-07-23
"It was commentary on the negative effects of men tying their feelings of worth to women's views of them, exacerbated by a society in which the Kens are literally just made to be with the Barbies and serve no other purpose.

"Barbie's problems are just as real as Ken's, though she doesn't find the vocabulary or context to define them until later in the film.  The cellulite isn't just about cellulite. It's a representation of concrete and deep fears like aging, perceived worth devaluing with a decline in what society views as beauty, loss of friendship or familiarity through uncontrollable events, irreversible change, unexpected growth and instability in life, sudden self doubt and awareness of your own mortality, and more. 

You also have to remember that while Barbie is privileged in her original world, her emotions and perspective are impacted by Gloria, a woman who arguably experiences less privilege and entitlement due to her gender in the ""real"" world.

To reduce it to a simple worry about cellulite is uncharitable to the thought put into the film and shows a lack of understanding about subtle approaches to nuanced themes.",2023-12-12

It was generally put back with room and an aim at improvement for the Kens. It was explicitly stated as such so the twisting and turning to look over that message is kind of weird.

Remember, the patriarchy montage is the characters seeing a non-matriarchal world for the very first time - of course seeing masculine hobbies and celebrities, men working ""female jobs"" like construction worker or president, and any sort of anti-feminine sentiment would be highlighted quite heavily in their minds.

""Finding yourself"" takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. And a lot of self discovery. I set out to find myself years ago. I feel closer to knowing but still unsure. it took a lot of time, and there is a long way to go. 

""Finding yourself"" to me, means to find ways to be content, happy and fulfilled. And that needs to come from within. Cause if it comes from a woman (or man) and she or he screws you over, then your sense of self, sense of fulfillment and sense of being happy is gone. And relationships are fickle! People will hurt you! Because that's human nature.

Dating apps are skewed, yes. I would not use them, as a woman or a man... they seem miserable for everyone. There is like 20 men for every woman, of course women will be very selective, and men in turn, desperate.

">that‚Äôs a feminists idea of what is good for men and what they should want - 95% of men don‚Äôt care or agree

And that's the problem there. We may not agree or want that but it is something we need. Reality says ad much. Look at the Manosphere. It's literally fueled by hatred of women no longer ""needing men"" and ""taking our masculinity and manhood"" thanks to ""evil feminism"". Men's Rights Activist movement is all about how men see (perceived) double standards that they feel women foisted upon us (even though they often miss the point that the patriarchy created those standards originally). If us men were as fine and dandy  with our relation to women as you seem to think, women would not have lost their rights to their bodies last year. Homophobia (which, like transphobia, is linked to misogyny) wouldn't still be rampant in men's spaces still.

>us men do not have a hard time obtaining a sense of self without a woman, that‚Äôs totally laughable and just something feminists tell themselves.

I didn't find the real world men particularly dumb. I thought that Will Ferrell's character was going to be a typical out of touch villain and while they played with that trope a bit but overall it seemed like the movie portrayed him and the rest of the board as competent and understanding characters. The thing to remember too is that the 'real' world was still a heightened reality, and the chase sequences made that pretty apparent.

Also re: Ken crying, again I didn't think it was specifically played for laughs, the way he came to the I Am Kenough realization was pretty in line with how the character had been portrayed up until that point. Barbie and Ken were both showed they don't have to tie their self-worth to external sources, I thought it was a nice parallel.

"I did not see much depth to the older woman scene. I think it is something they could have given more resonance to. 

I felt Barbie was crying not because of the complex actions, but because the world was different from Barbie World. She decides to LEAVE the human world because of what she sees, not become human. She does not decide to become human until the end of the movie. They weren't tears of empathy or desire, but fearful and emotional tears. The act of crying itself also scared her. That wasn't her wanting to become human, that was her wanting to go back to the doll world. She goes to Mattel to complain about the human world, and how it's backwards. She then flees from Mattel when she realizes she doesn't want to be in the human world anymore. She then goes back to the Barbie world to hide from Mattel. 

There's no depth to that human world interaction. She doesn't show any desire to want to be human. If you want to suggest that bench interaction is her catalyst for wanting to be human, the movie simply doesn't do enough to show that. Her time in the human world lasts about 25 minutes, and that is an accurate time count I just made. 

She then goes back to Barbie World and, as you said, the movie becomes about Ken. Because Ken has now changed from who he was at the beginning. And Ken will, again, undergo another change. With his character having a beginning, a middle, and an end. He goes from someone who is unhappy with who he is, to going on an adventure, to having made a significant change but also not finding happiness, hitting a rock bottom, and then through a struggle finding a new purpose. HE has the changes. Barbie doesn't.

This is me complaining that the movie is focused on Ken. Because it is. If we want our Barbie movie to be about women, this movie is about men. Both in how men affect women, and how a male character changes and grows. I think it could have been different.",2023-08-06

"i don't think the message is ""all men deserves no power"" and i think you're interpreting it as a slight against men/taking it too personally when it's very clearly a deliberate parallel to the real world. 

women had to fight really really hard for equal representation in government and are still fighting for it to this day. women first started holding political positions in the US in the 1910s, but we didn't have a female supreme court justice until 1981. it didn't matter if there were women back then who ""earned it"" or ""deserved it"". they were shut out of top government positions because they were women. 

that's the joke, that's the parallel- the movie clearly shows that kens are discriminated against in Barbieland and lack political power. the barbies acknowledge that, but they're still reluctant to actually give power to Kens. Kens are going to have to work for it even though they shouldn't have to. *just like women in the real world continue to have to work for equal representation even though we shouldn't have to.*",2023-07-24
"The movie doesn't say ""it's fine"". it's not hypocritical or vindictive. It's a mirror of the real world, but with kens instead of women. The ending is like that to highlight the fact that there is still a lot of work to be done in the real world when it comes to gender equality. It makes complete sense and I think an ending with a perfectly gender-equal utopia would've felt wishy washy, and odd in a movie with a theme about the inherent complexity of being a person",2023-07-22
"Nah, the thing about films is that they need to perfectly explain the premise, feed you context, and develop plot points. A good movie will end with a wrapped-up conclusion, but an even better movie will allow viewers to further contextualize the themes in the film and maybe try to think for themselves. A comedy film has the added layer of having to drive the point home, but still bringing it back to the initial funny jokes that built the storyline up to the final conclusion of the film.

Barbie does this well. It spends the whole film showcasing how a patriarchy/matriarchy is a detriment to society, and at the end, through the commentary and speeches of Barbie, the mother, and the president, you can understand that they are aware of this. The subplot of ""who am i, if not a stereotype of the perfect girl/barbie or guy/ken?"", is also addressed and concluded with comments from Barbie and Ken. There is enough nuance for the viewer to also understand this theme and conclude that ""any kind of 'triarchy' is bad and we should have balance and respect for each other and ourselves"".

However, it's a BARBIE film, and still a comedy film. So you can wrap up all those important themes, and then continue to make hypocritic jokes about said theme with the confidence that the viewer has understood the initial theme but can still laugh at the joke. Any comedy film that fails to do this would be considered a bad one.",2023-07-21
"A lot of those movies with main female characters are also WRITTEN and DIRECTED by men. So they‚Äôre not exactly real representations but a male caricature of what a woman is.

Hitchcock is an outlier but at the same time he was extremely sexist and awful to his female cast members. Tippi Hendren went public about how abusive he was ‚Äî he literally had her mauled by real birds instead of the fake ones he told her they would be for shock value. So not the best example to use here.

And it is mansplaining. Like I‚Äôve said before Barbie in the way she was intended by the founder, who was a woman, was a feminist doll. She was forced out of the company very early on and then it was controlled by men. Literally look through a list of all the high ranking people at Barbie.

I agree. Honestly I think the repeated Mattel board gag was funny so I'd say keep that but have another male character involved that's more grounded. Maybe make use of the husband/dad character instead of just the gag about him learning Greek.

Barbie seems to be a movie that‚Äôs a lot more concerned about tackling the patriarchy than it is about having female stars for the sake of female stars.

Feminism is something that so often simply gets framed as a women‚Äôs problem or a cause just for women to worry about. The fact of the matter is that men have to start learning how the patriarchy has shaped their lives and the lives of the women around them, and how they may be making things worse themselves. Imo, Ken is such a good satire of so many harmful tropes from men that I think a lot of young men can learn from going forward.

Mean Girls

LITERALLY Mean Girls.

Every SINGLE girl in that film is a moron, a bimbo, or gossipy, or MEAN. Even our teacher, who is the supposed voice of reason, had her chest exposed and was seemingly able to be manipulated by teenagers. 

And just like Barbie, that film was social satire. Not to be taken as an indictment on the entire female gender.",2023-07-27
"It‚Äôs a really weird and narrow guidelines that any movie has to have the same set up. Showing ‚Äúevery member of a large female cast as a moron‚Äù most movies just aren‚Äôt set up the same way. 

Anyone who thinks this movie is anti-men is clearly missing the point. 

All the Kens being portrayed as bumbling doofuses that only exist to support the Barbies is not supposed to be seen as a good thing. 

A good portion of the film‚Äôs message is that you shouldn‚Äôt take your own social movement so far that you trample on other people. That if we *don‚Äôt* give boys good role models, love and support, dreams to strive for, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll get swallowed up by the manosphere and turn into bitter angry assholes. 

Barbie didn‚Äôt owe Ken a relationship but she should‚Äôve been more respectful towards him, she should‚Äôve been more kind, seen the value in him.

"I am glad to see so many talking about the movie. 
Yeah the context of the movie was they were trying to make a point at the end that it is a constant process for women to be respected in the world. 
It did seem like the last joke was saying that Ken s should reflect the real world. That was my only point. 
Obviously, men in the past didn't respect women's metal faculties. That's wrong. The point of that should have been that it is wrong to treat the Ken's that way too. 
Either way, having a confusing narrative doesn't make the movie worthless. The "" I'm kenough"" quote is a wonderfully positive message for men to not find their self worth in a woman.",2023-07-24

"The men who are born now did not make the patriarchy they were born into it as well. Also the Barbies did decide to reinstate the Matriarchy at the end after the Kens made pace with each other and did the fun dance.

Also I do agree that the movie is parodying real life but flipping the switch however I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what they intended. I‚Äôve seen real people saying that they don‚Äôt care what any man has to say about the movie and that the kens deserve to be treated that way because of the patriarchy but don‚Äôt mention that the Matriarchy of the Barbies has been around waaay longer. 

I feel like they didn‚Äôt really mean to show that or if they did they did not do it very well since no one is saying anything bad about Barbie. They also don‚Äôt acknowledge the point you made about how if it was a Matriarchy then things wouldn‚Äôt be better it would be the same just reversed.",2023-07-22
"Interesting, the marketing did make it seem like it was gaggy but I felt it delivered on that.

For what it's worth, I try not to pay attention to marketing or trailers for movies that I know I'll be interested in anyway based on director, writer, and cast.

I can't speak to other people's reactions but I also felt the movie itself had a really good balance of relatable themes, comedy, and clever nods. Ignoring the obvious fact that it was about Barbie, to me the movie felt like it had something for everyone.",2023-07-21
This film clearly doesn‚Äôt view the matriarchy as a utopia either - it‚Äôs repetitive and simple. Also I feel if you think matriarchies being utopian in feminist theory is a big deal you missed the point - imagining these sites of matriarchy are a form of resistance for feminism against patriarchy.

"I actually don't think that the message is that Barbie world is better than anything even at the end, because even though they celebrate, it feels gross. And stereotypical barbie doesn't even want to play that game anymore. To me it reads more like: here We have a pendulum swinging dramatically in opposite directions and neither one is the right thing.

 I think it was kind of meant to be a role reversal for men watching it, so that they could get a feel for what it's like to live as a woman in this world, and if this is the first time they're realizing it, that could be a big revelation in a man's life. So I don't know it's still a Barbie movie that's ultimately weirdly about educating men while just celebrating women. Which at that level puts been in the position of what it's like to be patronized.

I kind of think men are supposed to be pretty picked up by that and fearful by these ideas so that then they can make that leap of oh yeah this is must be how women feel.

Pray tell, what was the brilliant genius satire in the way Gloria‚Äôs husband was looked down on by his wife as lame (the eye rolling the comments on the old boyfriend teaching her to drive)? 

Over and over in this movie whether it‚Äôs the Kens, real world men or even the human female hero‚Äôs husband, men are shown as morons to be mocked.

"FWIW, I really can't believe that this dark comedy ending we're discussing was their intention, particularly with how heavy handed so many of the other (good) messages the movie went over. I feel like it's just an unintentional outcome of trying to address more than they intended.

"Yet, they have the depth of emotion to understand and empathize with what America Farrera has experienced in her life as well as the plight of women in a society they know nothing about? Their emotions for that are strong enough that it makes them emotional as well as removes their brainwashing. Doesn't make sense, does it? 


Farrera talks about the struggles of motherhood, when none of the Barbies are mothers, and Midge is just a joke. Yet, the Barbies get emotional hearing her speech, but Kens they have known and have a good relationship with saying they feel disrespected, they definitely don't have the depth of emotions for that. Seems kind of sexist to suggest that the Barbies connect with women and their struggles such as motherhood and appearances, even though the Barbies have never experienced those things, but they can't understand a Kens need to be respected, appreciated, or feel equal.


Not to mention that at the end Barbies say we'll give you a small position and you can work up. They fully understand the Kens should have more, but choose not to give it to them as revenge - even saying one day you'll have enough power as women in the real world. That is clear vindictiveness. They emphathize more with the plight of women in a world they don't know than Kens they know and understand deserve more and are willing to keep the Kens down to prove that point.",2023-07-22

"Codependant, yes, but not the point of aggression. Barbieworld is uneven and encourages unhealthy dynamics, but Kens don't view Barbies as possessions, nor do Barbies view Kens that way. The patriarchy, and presumably the horses as well, cause the early rivalry between Ken and Ken, to escalate to violence. Before that it would be a beachoff.",2023-07-24
"The Barbie movie did have a good ending, though. Both Barbie and Ken got their happy endings, just not together. And that's okay! Part of the point of this film is to find your own happiness and path in life. You don't need to follow the one that is expected of you. 

Ken gets to go on and discover who he is, outside of his relationship to Barbie. He learns that just being Ken is enough, that he doesn't need Barbie or material things to prove his worth. He gets autonomy. 

Barbie gets to be human. She gets to experience a full life. She realized that being perfect isn't all it's cracked up to be. She gets to experience a full range of emotions - the good and the bad. She gets to set her own destiny. Barbie gets autonomy. Her life is no longer dictated by the person in the real world who is playing with her. 

You keep pointing out how this film is too heavy-handed on the feminist themes, but you seem to be missing the more subtle themes here. When Barbie tells the older woman at the bus stop that she's beautiful, it isn't just a surface level thing. She sees a woman in the last chapter of her (presumably) well-lived life. Barbie sees aging for the first time, and she finds the process beautiful and wonderful and wants that for herself. Life is complex, and she understands that deeply when she experiences crying for the first time.

I've read a few of your comments, and you keep pointing out that people are reading too deeply into this movie, but I feel like you are being dismissive because you can't see past your feelings about Ken's portrayal. Maybe it is because you don't understand what it is like being a woman in this world, because we've often been portrayed the same way Ken has: incompetent, nothing without our male counterparts, etc. I mean, the fact that you're upset that Barbie and Ken didn't end up together really shows how much you do not get the themes and commentary in this movie, even when the film is slapping you in the face with them. 

When Ken goes to the real world and gains a very limited view on patriarchy and what it is like for men in the real world, of course, it is going to seem shallow. It is shallow. He's experiencing these things for the first time, and of course, he is going to be over-the-top about what it means to be a man, and what comes with it. It's a mirrored critique of Barbie, and what it means (on a surface level) to be a woman. I think it is also a critique of some forms of feminism. There are absolutely branches/waves of feminism that are ""men suck, men dumb, women should rule everything, etc."" The goal of feminism - at its core - is equality, and a lot of the time, that gets lost when one group is also trying to empower themselves. Barbie, because she experienced humanity, understands that being who you are, finding your own path, empowerment and lifting up others is important. She explains that to Ken. Ken was an agent of misdirected change once before, so maybe he can be an agent for change in Barbieland to make it a more equal place for all of its inhabitants. Or maybe not? That's up to him to decide. Maybe one of the other Kens will be that change. They get to work towards that, just like women and marginalized groups in the real world are still working towards that.",2023-07-25

Ken ending up with Barbie would do for Barbie what Ken was made for in the first place - give her a good boyfriend she liked. Yes I get that isn‚Äôt in line with feminist don‚Äôt need no man ethos - but it‚Äôs entirely in line with the entire history of Barbie until this movie.",2023-07-25

If Ken can figure out who he is in Barbie land why can't Barbie? Why does changing her species help her figure out who she is? She's changing herself.

His personality was subtle and as an audience we were never blatantly fed an idea of who he was other than the discontinuation feature and the isolation that he maybe experienced. This movie did a lot of telling instead of showing, and with Allan they allowed him to reveal himself to the audience slowly through his behavior, instead of giving his exact personality and motives away up front through his words. He never outright states that he feels isolated, or identifies more with the Barbies than the Kens, or even that he has some serious self defense skills. He just does the stuff instead of talking about it and it allowed us to make our own inferences. It gave his character unexpected meaning and I enjoyed that.",2023-07-28

Ok cool. Tell that to all the women trying to tell men the movie had a super awesome message for them. If it‚Äôs just a commiseration and whine fest for women to rip on men (seems like it) then ok. But that opens the door for that to be ok for men. Got it.,2023-07-30

"Yeah men don‚Äôt define themselves by women at all. That‚Äôs a made up talking point. Sure some guys on YouTube talk about picking up chicks - but then so do women talk about the same. That‚Äôs been going on forever since long before the internet. It‚Äôs for teens who are insecure and trying to date but not nervous. Adults don‚Äôt take all that noise seriously.

And no women do not do just fine without men having broken gender roles at all. Actually in reality even though many women may not want to be dependant on men as housewives - they still are relying on men to hire them, to promote them into positions of power and so on. So in many ways many women ‚Äúbreaking free from gender roles‚Äù and achieving ‚Äúequality‚Äù are still totally dependent on men, even if they‚Äôre able to overlook that.

Doing just fine without men would be not wanting or caring if men promote women at work, not wanting more women on corporate boards, doing that all for yourself and starting female only workplaces without men‚Äôs help etc. 
So you might say some women do fine without men in their personal lives and some men struggle without women in their personal lives, but a whole lot of women do require a lot from men in their professionals lives and a whole massive lot of men do just fine without women in their professional lives.

"no but it does stem from the patriarchy!!

women have those expectations of themselves bc they know that that's what's required of them if they want to succeed. but even if the expectations come from their own drive, the requirements came about due to the patriarchy. 

you see, it's bc men in power come in all varieties. u can be obnoxious or crass or timid or funny or rude or anything else. but there are strict requirements for women bc in a patriarchal society, women have to be exceedingly competent to get the recognition that men do, while still being careful maintain an image that shows that we ""know our place"" and still have traditionally feminine characteristics of being kind and gentle and motherly and all that.

and what do you mean by ""without the patriarchy there will be much worse pressure for working women""?? üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ if the patriarchy didn't exist then women would be able to rise through the ranks exactly as men do without having to be conscious of everything that gloria mentioned.

I wouldn‚Äôt have minded the movie being longer to develop things, but it was just all really ambitious.

If you follow their character arcs, Ken follows a dramatic comedy more closely than Barbie would follow a dramatic tragedy.

I totally agree. If you literally have to tell the movie's message through a monologue then you haven't told the story well or at least didn't believe you did. With the social media today where we get inspiring messages every day on basically every topic it's  unnecessary to do the same in a movie.

Again there is no motivation behind everything. Why does her daughter hate her? Does she work too much? Does she not talk to her? Just because her daughter is a teen? She supports her mom but it doesn't take much effort kinda showing their relationship wasn't that bad to begin with. Then, we don't really get introduced to her job or what she does at all.

Like was she already responsible for Barbie in some way since she worked at Mattel or was truly only at the lower level? We don't really know... I just feel like so many details were skipped over and forced. Her daughter in the school scene is painted as a mean girl but no reason is given. Like you said in the heat of the car chase the mom says her daughter hates her but no reason why... When the daughter decides to go back and help Barbie nothing has happened but taking a tour of Barbieworld and seeing Barbie give up.  It's like we get from point A to C, with little mention of B.

Edit: Yeah she pitches Normal Barbie but it doesn't feel personal to her character at all. We know nothing about the mom except she has dark thoughts for some reason.

Yeah I think I felt most let down by the lack of development in the mother daughter relationship. I also don't get why the dad was on the sidelines so much. I thought in the beginning it was gonna be a set up of she was a single mom or the dad died so she had to work more and that strained her relationship with her daughter. Except no dad is very much alive and practicing Spanish...even though there is no reference to why he is doing so, no clear confirmation the family is supposed to be Hispanic (even though we know America is). It just felt random and like why put him there if he's gonna do nothing? I just felt lost about why she or the daughter were there.

Women simply don‚Äôt need to make a lot of money to attract a mate or have sex. It‚Äôs complicated, but I think it makes sense.",2023-07-22

"Satire ie exaggerated humor, ridicule or irony to critique stupidity and vices, especially in a political context.

It‚Äôs a black comedy that is very exaggerate. Saying this film  meant to convey men are stupid is a surface level interpretation that completely ignores the greater  critique of our society and media. It‚Äôs not a critique of the male gender.

Seriously, you think one movie meant  to be an exaggerated comedy is worst for the portrayal of men, than women casted seriously in the bimbo role for decades?   


Using women as plot decides becomes problematic when majority of films are male-led and women have limited options for the types of characters they portray and consistently suffer from  lazy writing.   


I used Marilyn as a classic example, but  this is not an issue of the past. Margot  Robbie has openly spoken about  how she had to fight  against being typecasted in roles like her character in Wolf of Wall Street, whose only purpose is to be an object of  desire for the leading man and audience. And... Homer Simpson is anmisted character. Not an actual person like Robbie who these issues have real-life impact on.   


That is one dramatic comparison. Tell me, when did me a marginalized group dealing with legal segregation on and a lack of civil rights? Last i checked,  men still hold majority of the positions of power in the world. This film  won‚Äôt change that.

If you think the purpose of this film is to mock men, you completely missed the actual messages being conveyed. The end of the movie clearly acknowledges and validates the suffering of  both men and women‚Äòs suffering under both the institutions of feminism and patriarchy. It says the institutions are the result of people trying to survive in a world shitty for both genders. Barbielland is not  an attack on men, it is showing us a world where gender roles are reversed to illustrate how ridiculous it is on a society and cultural level.

Barbie, despite being told that it's a ""multi-layered satire"" (it's not, but whatever, if we're told that's what it is and it must be true right?) just isn't an enjoyable movie - even as a comedy, which is what it's supposed to be.

"Actually no, it‚Äôs not a problem with men. The problem is in thinking there‚Äôs something wrong with men because they don‚Äôt feel the same way as women and believing feminist women know better than them what is good for them emotionally. That‚Äôs no different than men insisting women are too emotional and need to repress what is normal for them. The problem is taking the emotional state and expression of emotion that a woman finds desirable and holding that up as the standard which is good for both men and women and men just don‚Äôt know it and need to be corrected. That‚Äôs actually very arrogant.

You do realise there‚Äôs a wide array of men who don‚Äôt throttle their wives both in this era and in every other era gone past well before feminism was a thing right? The choice isn‚Äôt between throttling your wife or doing whatever Bell Hooks says.

The third alternative is accepting that there‚Äôs actually nothing wrong with men on the whole and they aren‚Äôt really any  different today than they were 500 years ago and that‚Äôs absolutely a-ok. And accepting that the reason they‚Äôre not receptive to Bell Hooks or Gerwig style feminism is because they don‚Äôt actually emotionally need or benefit from the things that feminist women agree with other feminist women that they need. Yes some of them will sometimes do bad things to varying degrees - and most of them won‚Äôt. But that will never change no matter how much feminism you try to push on them.",2023-07-26

Neither is better, and they have different tastes. 19/20 women have superior multitasking and linguistic abilities. 19/20 men have better abity to rotate 3D objects in their mind, for example.

I know this - this is why the messaging is so convoluted and seems man especially man hating (though every man in this being dumb didn‚Äôt help either). It‚Äôs why it comes off that Ken is bad when he does something about his oppression while real world women good, it‚Äôs why people are confused on whether it‚Äôs meant to be an inverted world or the Kens are bad. It‚Äôs just bad writing - you can‚Äôt successfully make a character 10 conflicting things and expect it to be coherent.

I understand what they tried to do with the writing but they failed. It also doesn‚Äôt help that they made every single real world male and every Ken dumb as hell and had them do bad things - of course when you so completely caricature a gender like that it will come off as bitter and resentful of that gender.

"But is there noteworthy screentime showing how Ken puts effort into  fixing himself? A remark and a color change to frunturie is not character development. That also doesnt answer Barbies and Kens coexisting TOGETHER. I am talking about a harmonious relationship for mutual benefiet.

It's still a weird message for a toyline that its creators do not manufacture for multi purpose play use. A better end to get the same point acrosd woyld Ken storming down to Ynon Kreiz's house, demmanding his company to change Barbielnd but that would mean Barbieland is not autonomous, being the way it is becsuse its creators forced the setting to be as such. Instead it is its own secondary world realtily where the male gender has a hive mind until they wake up and realize o we dont need to act like this?

Barbie steorytpes exist because theres not a lot of options of how to use them just like army soldiers. So it would make more sense to do a toystory esque story where the live action Barbielanderd fight back against the toy compnies that make them? Ken could have ended up with a whole new Ken line beyond a new physical appernces and name.  A line of Ken that forces kids to factor in a persoanitly different from what has been typically ascribed to him though kids these days already do that on their own . . . so


Idk sounds like theres no major long lasting on screen evidence to support Greta's and Noah's theme. Again a last mintue line and pink to green blue doesnt sound like enough. Seems plot needs fixing.

Ken = self improvement.

I want to know is it given an acutal plot line.

A quick one liner at the end does not show a protaginst sovling their problem. Instead this form of dialogue stands out as a conflict resolver put on instant easy mode. Unless theres a Barbie part 2 a lot is left up in the air.

I still dont get it though based on the spoilers I read here. Girls and boys are known to play with  Barbie the toyline in steoryptical ways because the company specialized in making those steorytpes stick. As a lin of dolls theres not much diverisity in their play use. So a change in the toy player's imagagtion would need to be the foucs of change and the comapny. Ken as part of the toyline has no agency. Its weird to not have us in the movie influcining how they act. We WE humans are the reason for generic Kens. It is OUR mindset, not his.

I thought the film picked stuff like action movies and horses because they're silly and of low consequence. I would not have enjoyed if Ken's plan to bring patriarchy to Barbieland involved violence against the Barbies or any other depressing real world example of patriarchy's harms. So the movie went with these silly alternatives to represent patriarchy instead because the film is ultimately a comedy and having the Barbies and Kens argue over minifridges and brewskis is more comedic than them arguing over abortion. I thought the film did actually represent the good that male friendships could do for the men involved and in the end Barbie encouraged Ken to find his own identity that didn't revolve around pleasing her. I thought it was a set up for a sequel and the next film will be more about Ken really internalizing that he is Kenough and that he can be happy without Barbie.,2023-07-23

"Fair enough, thanks for engaging in the discussion.

I suppose my issue is I‚Äôve always viewed these things from a ‚Äògender neutral‚Äô view e.g. the traits of toxic masculinity are toxic when in either men or women (but the concept of masculinity promotes them in men), same for toxic femininity (those same traits are toxic when a man does them too)‚Ä¶the same for the historical stuff, I tend to view it as rather than a gendered thing it was a power thing (and you are right it was men who had the power‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt think in a female dominated society/equal society the government would run things any better (apart from maybe things about abortion etc) because it‚Äôs the power structures rather than the people‚Äôa gender which is the issue. That said once there is a distinction drawn between people then it becomes ‚Äòus‚Äô Vs ‚Äòthem‚Äô- again it‚Äôs an intersectionality thing for me, I think being from working class northern England I‚Äôve got more in common with women from my same position than I do with men from middle class America (or women from here do with Americans) and we can draw up other divisions e.g. women got universal suffrage in 1928 in the U.K‚Ä¶men got universal suffrage in 1918 just 10 years earlier (and it was rich and powerful people who stopped everyone before that‚ÄîI focus on the richness/class aspect rather than the gender aspect‚Ä¶as it was done to disenfranchise both men and women)


As for your last bit, that does make more sense my wife and I were just having a conversation the other day about the beauty standards she feels even when being told not to (by me or by others in society now there‚Äôs a shift to more body positivity)‚Äîthere is a total element of self-efficacy and expectations linked to the story of growing up and realising life won‚Äôt be the idealised view you had of it as a kid",2023-07-28

"Sure, I agree with you. Of course the whole movie is Mattel's PR, they paid for it. And thanks for the short history of the doll, that would've been a whole movie in itself. But Barbie's impacts on girls and women still remain, even if that wasn't and isn't Mattel's primary goal (money is). And even if Mattel is using all of this to pose itself as a female empowerment force just to gain more customers (it would be dumb for them not to support female empowerment considering their main target audience), those impacts still remain.
Sure, she might have started as a bimbo bombshell doll as you say, but I don't think everyone would share that idea of Barbie nowadays. As a decades old toy, she is history and, in some ways, mirrors the different time periods and the ways femininity is perceived, performed and enforced.
As for your questions, if you want a pacific Barbie movie you have the animated ones, I guess. Is it negative to use gender wars as a theme for the movie? I mean, it's an evergreen topic.

As for being a true reflection of society, there isn't such a thing even in a documentary. And this is a movie about living dolls that exagerates a lot for comedy.

It didn't have any particularly interesting cinematography or filmmaking choices, except when they needed visual gags or playing on the Barbie aesthetic.  

As a filmmaking study, Oppenheimer probably has a lot more to look at, but as a work of art, which I think is the greater purpose of filmmaking as a tool, Barbie did a much better job by creating something enjoyable, entertaining and thought provoking.

How do you figure? For every wealthy CEO you see on the cover of Forbes, you're not seeing his wife and family who enjoy all of the riches with none of the work. 

On that point, there's lots of wealthy powerful women in the real world. In BarbieLand, literally no man had any influence, political power, or cultural cache whatsoever. 

Regardless, the vast majority of men are not wealthy, so it seems unfair to castigate the entire gender for what is actually the actions of the relatively small wealthy donor class.

I didn't say that, actually. Sexism obviously exists, but you can't tell me that Gosling's character getting inspired by a mid-movie montage about various types of millionaires and CEOs is somehow a reflection of male privilege and not class privilege. 

This is actually a widespread issue with feminist narratives. Many things attributed to ""The Patriarchy"" in fact class issues, not gender issues, but you can bet your ass that the wealthy are perfectly ok with this divide-and-conquer strategy that keeps the working poor at each others throats by obfuscating the abuses of the rich against poor as abuses of men against women.",2023-07-23

Rather, I think the purpose of their juxtaposed lines was to highlight the stereotypical difference between the basic ""in public"" operating mentality that men and women are perceived to have.

The problem is that this stereotype isn't entirely accurate, as men *don't* inherently feel safe or admired around total strangers in public.

This is just one of several scenes that revealed a general ignorance by the film's writers of actual male psychology. They seem to be deep into the fringes of modern feminist political dogma, which generally holds men in very low regard. We see that throughout the film, with the total lack of any positive male role model, or frankly, any male character who wasn't an idiot, pervert, greedy fuckface, or some combination thereof.",2023-07-23

I'm a man. I'm even straight, married, and with kids! But at no point did I feel like the movie was making fun of me, and it's because I'm wholly uninterested in dominating women, fist fighting other men, riding horses, etc.

In fact, it's very *tender* with men like me:

1. I think Barbie tells Ken it's OK to cry (movies can sometimes make me cry) when Ken is busy being ashamed of it. Barbie apologizes for not spending time with him (the idea of crying being a shameful, ""womanly"" act is a feature commonly associated with toxic masculinity)

2. The movie encourages men not to define themselves in terms of getting a romantic partner (this is something Ken struggles with throughout the movie) when Barbie tells Ken to figure out who *he* is by himself rather than who he is in relation to her. This is something I've had to work on and get better about, personally. (the idea of only being a real man when you've got a woman to protect is a feature commonly associated with toxic masculinity)

3. I think the most likeable man in the movie is Allan, who decides to leave rather than support Kendom, and he only resorts to violence when he and his female colleagues are forced to by the hyperaggressive Kens. The movie made this conscious choice to contrast his man-ness with the toxic man-ness of the Kens. Sorry I don't have the academic terms for this stuff.

Point is, the movie skewers a common image of what a man is supposed to be, but that's not the same thing as skewering men (which would be more like ""lol penises are so stupid, men are all irrational beings, etc.).",2023-07-25

"The gynecologist ""scene"" is a joke. It's been seen universally as a joke. It is delivered as a joke. I am not suggesting visiting a gynecologist is a joke, but the movie treated this scene as a joke. There is absolutely, 100%, man or woman, no way to begin a discussion on if the gynecologist ""scene"" is a joke or not. 

The misdirection on her visit being for a gynecologist IS a shock. It's misdirection. That's the point. That's why they didn't say ""good luck at the gynecologist"". Because it would give the joke away. If they said in the car ""good luck at the gynecologist"", and she walked in and said ""my gynecologist"", it wouldn't be a scene. It would be nothing.

We cannot get anywhere in a discussion if you are unwilling to admit the truth. This is the most absurd thing I have ever been a part of as a discussion. You cannot accept a basic fact about the movie - so there is no point in having a discussion here. 

I understand the issues between the genders. I don't know what this rant has to do with the movie or my criticism of it.

For the record, 10 minutes before the credits is Will Ferrel talking about tickling people. Are you perhaps thinking 10 minutes before the credits was a different scene? Because it's a short scene. You're telling me you teared up during a joke. The beginning of any dramatic, emotional parts begins with like 6 minutes left in the movie. Because as I have said, the movie is very. very. very brief on any development or even action for its lead character.

Maybe, maybe not. But highlighting it and recognizing it isn't a bad thing. And regardless of the creator's intent, this movie really resonated with me in that way. From the beginning, you can see these guys struggling with feeling lonely and unseen. And at the end of the movie, they still largely feel that way.

"Thank you for apologising. The issue I generally have with this film is the writing, not the politics. I agree with the political message, but the writing badly let's it down in my view. 

The inciting incident of the film is Barbie getting thoughts of death, then flat feet, then cellulite, because someone on the outside playing with her is having dark thoughts, so she has to set out to find this girl and repair the rift between their two worlds. This is part of the story is set up over a good portion of the first half (building a main plot) and then abandoned as an idea completely in favour of dealing with the patriarchy that came to Barbie land (switching the main plot). Barbie stops caring completely about Gloria to cry on the floor. A great representation of women right there.

Generally in a movie like this you should like the characters, not all of them, but you should generally like some of the characters as you follow them on their journey. Liking the characters is actually key to stories which are trying to impart a message like this. If you don't care about the characters why should you care about the issues they are facing?

Character development is about watching people go through something that better themselves in the process. I don't know if you know any writers but they will tell you these things are not random. There are storytelling devices and formula writers use to get you to like and dislike characters, to get invested so you feel more when the characters are sad or happier for them in a good ending. For example, you can tell when you watch this film they want you to like Sasha because she was a bratty teen in the beginning and a smiley helpful girl by the end, so there is a character arc. But how did that transformation happen? We didn't really see it, it just happened. The fact that it's a comedy doesn't negate the need for character development.

If we don't see the thing that changed someone, we can't understand why they changed, we can't relate, we don't care any more about this character because now they seem like they act on a whim rather than having truly changed. They had plenty of time to take us on the character journeys to help us invest in their transformations and ergo their values and dreams, but instead they chose not to show us that and use that time to spoon-feed us the message through exposition. And that is my gripe with this film. There are so many characters in here I could have loved that's just wasted potential and that only adds to the disappointment.

If you take character development out of a story, you can be left feeling like it's not a story at all, hence my comment on it feeling more like a training video. At no point was I ""routing"" for anyone in the movie, I just watched it all unfurl before me, lapping in the colours and the concepts of Barbie not actually having to drink anything from a cup or walk down stairs. OK cool. A laugh here and there. Watching the Kens singing a bit too long, which annoys me because time in film is limited, and if you haven't developed your character's yet you should not be wasting time on songs. In fact the idea that you would favour the musical aspect over the character development is an allegory for the superficiality of this movie. You have a light hearted film with a serious message that either takes itself way too seriously in places and then does a complete 180 to be completely superficial in others. 

And by the end... what do you feel? Do you feel triumphant that they saved Barbieland and that Barbie became a real woman? Did you understand that part of the movie where Ruth shows her some random old home videos of people having a good time? (That is not meant as a jab, honestly, because I didn't). What exactly is the message there? ""Patriarchy means life is shit for women but I would still like to go participate in that world and die at the end because the matriarchy I have for me back home is not all it's cracked up to be""? ""I'd like to go live in the world where I was ogled and verbally abused please"" - but why? We see Barbie make this choice to live in the real world/patriarchy but we are not given a reason why other than she doesn't think she fits in anymore in Barbieland, no longer like the other Barbies (which is an unfortunate alignment with the toxic phrase ""not like other girls""). Maybe she chose the real world over a fake plastic eutopia, but that is Barbies ""real"" world. Those are her real friends. We are not given a real reason why the short portrayal of LA being an awful in your face and down your throat patriarchy is a better place than barbieland. If they had shown the good side (which I think they attempted through the blurry home videos) in a more real way we might get it, but then why is Ruth warning her about the real world before showing a highlights real? 

A lot of things don't make sense in the movie and are just glossed over, which you can do when you have such an effective marketing campaign and an audience who already agree with you, but this movie won't be winning anyone over from the other way of thinking. And is this film a comedy? Imo it doesn't know what it wants to be, just like Barbie at the end. I'm honestly glad so many people liked it and weren't as disappointed as I was with it, so many hard core fans turned up in pink Barbie merch and when the credit rolled in my theatre you could hear a pin drop.

Then look at the Kendom, they‚Äôre idiots, they fight, Ken literally admits he doesn‚Äôt even want to be in power. The whole Kendom is a comedic take down of ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù and obviously meant to highlight and exaggerate negative male behaviour - you can‚Äôt say that the Barbie Matriarchy is written in such a way that it comedically skewers and highlights negative female behaviour and paints it in a comparatively negative way.",2023-08-06

Still, men being more powerful in other areas, could afford to have some shots taken at them in the form of some Homer Simpson or hundreds of other examples, just like Mattel is seemingly taking shots in this film, but the company won't be hurting for it.



Regarding Kens and what they're expected to be/do, I honestly don't know about them,  but I do agree with the film in the area that there are double standards for women (and minorities) and as a man I can see this more clearly the older I am, and that everyone (including women themselves) will always find a way to shit on the woman. And in situations where two people in the public eye do a similar type of misdeed, the woman will often take more shit for it. On the other hand, I can also see that women can be hampered by having too many expectations and goals that are difficult to combine like wanting to achieve something or be the best but also being universally liked and respected and or raising children and or managing other's peoples emotions/expectations etc and generally caring too much and too intensy about precisely what other people will thing as well as other stuff that men generally can afford to care less about. 

Also, I do still feel that pretty much all the Kens were stupid with low social intelligence, very little know-how about anything other than beach or dancing, they had construction workers who didn't know how to build a wall (a skill that most toddlers are capable of) and who were all beaten by one Allen, who is obviously less physically fit than all the Kens. They also uncreatively all sang the same song to their Barbies right next to each other which is just plain silly. 

Overall, I liked the film, I liked the acting, I laughed at the jokes. I felt like the film was quite messy and chaotic in what it was trying to achieve and there are plenty of elements and messages that for me don't blend together, even though they might be valuable apart from each other.",2023-07-25
"Men being a dumb stereotype in a feminist movie being ‚Äúexpected‚Äù hardly excuses it. It actually says something quite negative about feminism and the director that it was expected.

Maybe Gerwig just wrote all the men dumb because that‚Äôs how she really thinks and that‚Äôs why the Barbie matriachy is obviously better portrayed than the Kendom and real world. Or maybe she just sees it as fine to make all men into a strawman character of idiots to make her feminist point.

which then felt undermined by the barbie's celebrating keeping things the same by tricking the ""dumb"" kens. It really took the wind out of the emotion all the ken's dealt with and made them seem stupid for being so easily manipulated.

It's not Barbie's place to fix Ken, but don't have Ken go through this shit then immediately play it out like a joke. Ken finally feels acceptance and respect but then it turns into an obsession with horses and going full incel, Ken deals with heartache and jealousy but the joke is he's dumb and fragile for having those feelings, Ken deals with loss of power and confusion about purpose and it's played for laughs with him blubbering.

If you mean Donnie brasco that‚Äôs not sexist at all it can‚Äôt even be suggested

Last Tango in Paris is a kinky sex romance which also isn‚Äôt sexist

Wolf of Wall Street - how is this sexist? There‚Äôs not a negative overall portrayal of women in relation to men. A naked woman who is a gold digger is one character, not an entire gender

Transformers - lol what? How? How are the women in that portrayed negatively. I see the problem here, you think that women not staring in something means the movie is sexist or a negative portrayal. No - what makes Barbie so sexist against men is their entire gender is portrayed as idiots. You can‚Äôt honestly say that is the case in transformers at all.

I think you should continue because none of the movies you‚Äôve mentioned portray the entire gender of women as stupid and doing bad things - they may have portrayals of a single bad female character or even just have bad things happen to a female character ala once upon a time in America - but none are so uncomplicatedly potraying a whole gender as idiots doing something wrong.

Sexual assault and women being brutally hurt (men are also brutally hurt on screen) is in no way sexist like the Barbie movie because it isn‚Äôt making a generically bad image of an entire gender like Barbie does.

You need to get over yourself because your comment is very misguided. It‚Äôs not one negative portrayal of someone of a specific gender which makes a movie hateful - that‚Äôs one character - it‚Äôs when every character from the same gender is portrayed as stupid and in the wrong.

There have been plenty of kind husbands sure, there have been far more abusive ones.  Marriage was typically not about valuing women, but about controlling them. Look up the origin of the wedding ring.

And men did things for themselves, what is this bullshit about doing it for women?  When an army of men sacked a city, raped all the women, and killed the children, that was done for women?

You are speaking in generalities to justify you misanthropy, you can't even provide one historicla example of men putting women above themselves.  Human history is cruel to anyone without power.

"> the choice to make all the Ken‚Äôs kind of a joke was not to be taken as a literal description of real men. 

It quite clearly was. Most of the jokes don't land if you don't interpret the Kens as either real world women (for the first 15 minutes), or real world men. The behaviour the Kens exhibit after Ken returns is textbook toxic masculinity. If you're saying that isn't meant to be taken literally, then you're discounting a key message of the movie - one that isn't exactly delivered subtly.

I'm not sure you're understanding my point: I was fully up for a movie that flips the roles and puts men as victims of a matriarchy to highlight women's struggles in the real world, *but it doesn't do that*. Well it does, but only for 15 minutes. The rest of the movie flips it back to a patriarchy, and continues to attack men the whole time. The movie wants to have its cake and eat it. It wants men to be the victims when highlighting women's struggles, but also simultaneously maintain them as aggressors when critiquing the patriarchy. It's attacking them from two fronts: a satirical one, and a sincere one. Women are never the bad guys in this movie, whether they're representing real-world men or real-world women.",2023-08-05

At the end when they explain why he went crazy they didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs because of the way he was treated by the Barbies they say it‚Äôs because he was in love with Barbie which completely ignores the theme that Kens are being treated the same as women and the Barbies are just as bad as men. 

Then saying that the Kens can not have a spot on the Supreme Court as well was laughed at and the narrator said ‚Äúonce the kens get it they‚Äôll have as much power as women in the real world.‚Äù which says they still will be treated badly since us women are still treated badly.

If they made it more clear that the Barbies were in the wrong too I would like it more.

And this movie is certainly not just for fun. It is about sexism and teh patriarchy. It is about social norms and gender roles. It is very much political. And a commentary too, yes.

This is precisely why it is bad and awful because it is sexist, so all commentary about how oppressed women are become irrelevant, when in the next scene, it gleefully treats men the same way it critisizes society for treating women. Do you comprehend what I just wrote?

About Oppenheimer. The cast doesn't matter for this movie because it is about the atomic bomb, not about gender.

"Yeah - those are two characters not an entire gender. In case you didn‚Äôt realise Al Bundy is also the butt of the joke and dumb, actually the whole family is a joke. But here only Ken and men are while Barbies aren‚Äôt - that‚Äôs the difference. Actually the movie suffers in another way for it - the Barbies are more boring then the Kens because they‚Äôre not allowed to be the butt of the joke. A lot of potential humour was missed by not having some of the Barbies be more in line with the Bimbos people thought of them as and others be clever. Like a beach Barbie and a scientist Barbie. Instead they‚Äôre all clever.

I‚Äôm not just saying Ken is an idiot - I‚Äôm saying all the Kens and real world men are portrayed as idiots. If it were just beach Ken or even a lot of other Kens it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. 

Again Ken being unimportant doesn‚Äôt bother me, if anything he is too important and it detracts from Barbie who is boring as a result. Ken was a doctor and a bunch of other jobs though. He was often released with the same job as Barbie.

Oh yes we‚Äôre just too sensitive. I‚Äôll be sure to use that line on women when they‚Äôre offended by a movie and see how it goes down.

And since so many women can‚Äôt recognise it then I can‚Äôt really be assed to care about the point of the movie from womens point of view.

"if everyone's got it, then why didn't they get that the kens are being treated the way women in the real world are being treated? why are you still mad about that? or is it because you refuse to acknowledge the issue and women aren't, in fact, treated like that? 

if the message of the movie seems muddled to you, then you haven't got the ability to look at the nuance of it. it's art/film, ""mixed messages"" is a poor way to classify this since anything other the depth/diversity of ideas presented would be boring and shallow. it's supposed to get you to think. you cant just give up when you find something confusing, did you even do math in high school? lol 

finally, everyone in my circle that i've spoken to, havent had the same impression of all the men being dumb/idiots. maybe consider that you're possibly projecting? (you should read Baumeister et al, 1998 for more evidence on that) 

ps. just to clarify, kens are not 'men', barbies are not 'women'",2023-07-23
"What *is* the takeaway from the movie? Because it genuinely did seem a bit muddled.

I mean initially it seems like the Kens in Barbie world are supposed to an analogue for women living under that Patriarchy, safe and secure and meaningless existences with literally no agency. Barbies have all the agency and all the intellect and control of the world.

But then Ken goes to the Real World, discovers Patriarchy, and brings it back to Barbie Land. And somehow, dominates and brainwashes the entire matriarchy, upending it, and turning it into a Patriarchy? So then it's *not* about the Kens being an analogue for women under the Patriarchy? 

So is the film then saying that it's not about a flipped Patriarchy, but the fact that Kens when they gain power will *inevitably make* a Patriarchy?

The film seems to play odd beats with the story and who exactly is meant to be running the show. It's got to be the Barbies to begin with, but one trip to Patriarchy -land (the real world) and Ken is suddenly capable of upending the status quo because the Barbies are helpless and without agency of their own. And this is reversed again because the Kens are dumb and can be tricked into fighting each other letting main Barbie convert the other Barbies back to the way they should be. 

The film can't seem to decide whether the Kens are supposed to be weak and incompetent or overpowering and duplicitous. It's got to be the former for the start and the end of the film to happen, but it's got to be the latter for the middle to make any sense.

As far as I could tell, the Kens are dumb without agency. And if they get agency, they're oppressive. But they're too dumb to hold onto their oppressive agency, so they go back to being regular dumb without agency. I'm not sure I'm really seeing a positive representation there. Ryan Gosling may be 'Kenough' but that appears to be the extent of it.",2023-07-23

That's the thing. I would never catch myself doing any of the ""toxic"" things men did in the movie. I feel like the film tried to potray masculinity as something bad. Theres nothing wrong with having big cars or working out (tho these are not inherently masculine things), but it was somehow put in the same category as slapping  random girls ass on the street. I feel like normal ""masculine"" things were put in the same bag as cat calling and just being an ass to women. That's where the "" man=bad"" comes from. Trying to prove that being masculine is bad. Look at Alan. The only guy that wasn't masculine was somehow the good guy. If it wasn't for him than all the men would be portrayed as assholes.

What we do know is that even though he doesn‚Äôt exhibit the traits that the movie decries, he is still constantly forgotten about and treated as an afterthought. Not even from a relationship standpoint, there were times when characters just forgot he was there. Is he lonely? Does he want a relationship? Who knows? Nobody has asked.

"> Yes that's a reflection on my parents which is a whole other conversation, but we have to acknowledge that reality that many people have such stories from their childhood like mine.

I grew up in the middle of football, beer, gym, guns, hunting, going muddin, and etc.  I'm a nerdy weeb who liked the powerpuff girls and my little pony and is a furry and etc.  It was also straighty mcstraightville where I grew up, and despite not really having a strong attraction to guys and the pressure around me I had accepted I was bisexual and accepted that by like 20.

During the very early years of me being a furry and bisexual both were grounds for literally being beaten and liking girly shit was definitely more of a social ostracization thing.

&nbsp;

That being said, shit hasn't been like that for 30 years.  Roughly 30 years ago society and expectations rapidly started changing.  And today that shit is almost completely in the past.  **But people still cite out of date shit from decades ago, like you are now, that is not reflective of current society.**

&nbsp;

> That's why we actively work to normalize it; while yes it says a lot more about that person we have to consider that they're just perpetuating what they've been programmed to. So much like America Ferrera in the film actively working to break it for those people is a good thing.

You're too fucking late, its already normalized.  People talking shit about it now are those people you get a school project with who are never there when there is work needing to be done but show up at the end for the final few days and try to take credit.  The work has been done.  The social pressures, if anything, actually lean in the favor of the previous outliers these days.  

I've grown up and lived on the front lines, so to speak.

&nbsp;

Yes, even in deep country (where my family is and I still regularly visit).  They might think you're weird, but if you're reliable and responsible and you can handle your shit and tank the slings and arrows of life they'll respect the hell out of you.  Now if you're a weak ass entitled little shit who catastophizes everything and makes minor life issues into big problems?  They'll hate you.  But that's less to do with WHAT you are and more to do with HOW you are.  

People are not always great at communication, but conservatives value heavily maturity, self reliance, and toughness.  And alot of the modern ""non conforming"" folks you're looking for acceptance for do not have those things.  They're still figuring out themselves and extremely emotionally vulnerable, they often can't do shit on their own and need constant help an validation even for normal life shit, and every little thing in life becomes something to be angry and depressed about.

&nbsp;

And that's where much of the current cultural divide lies.  Not in terms of your identity, but in terms of all the other baggage.  The difference in ideals.  Conservative folks valuing independence and toughness and capability and self reliance while most of these other identities are inter-reliant to the point of co-dependence on each other, hurt by everything, often very world dumb and unable to do alot of common things for themselves, etc.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

People that hate specific identities or races do exist, but they are a tiny drop in the bucket today. It's mostly about value differences and most of our non-conformists being so weak and cringy that its a complete turnoff.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But even then, the people who would have felt pressured to fit in back then will still feel pressured to fit in now.  They'll just feel pressured to be bi/gay/trans/etc instead of being pressured to be macho/straight/tough/girly/etc.  And we're seeing alot of that.  The social pressure hasn't gone away or gotten healthier.  It's just changed the stereotypes it pressures people into.",2023-07-25

"Yeah, you don't get a pass to be a jerk incel by bringing up the potential lack of free will. We all have that same ""lack of free will"" and MOST of us aren't shit heads about women. Nice try changing the subject though. 

Also you're full of shit anyway because I've never met a single decent woman who gives a single shit about any of the things you listed earlier. But if you keep blaming everyone and everything except yourself, you will never be able to grow. 

The things I used to get my self worth from were very different than they are today. Just like everyone. When I was 5, I got my self worth from being able to do my letters and numbers. When I was 13 I got my self worth from people seeing me with a pretty girl. When I was 17 I got my self worth from believing I was smarter than everyone around me. When I was 21 I got my self worth from simply not dying of frostbite sleeping in my broken car for months in the winter. With so many weird and bad ones in between.

 And now I get it from a LOT of things. Some external and some internal. From beating the boss of a hard game, from finishing a project I had been delaying for too long. From washing dishes without getting water on my shirt. From being able to stand up to my dick head dad. Showing someone a band I found that they end up liking and them getting all excited about it. Watching people I know and love grow and evolve. You get the picture? 

Nobody even knows how many vacation days I have. Nobody knows my annual income. Nobody cares what car I drive, I have a nice car because I place a high level of importance on being able to reliably remove myself from situations and a shitbox cannot do that. I live in a small house intentionally because I'd prefer having extra money around for creature comforts, nobody cares how big my house is, at least nobody whose opinion I value. Most of the women I have ever dated have never known and NONE of them have cared about any of it. 

You've convinced yourself you're a victim of society, and maybe that's true. But WE ALL ARE. Even Elon musk, the richest person on the entire planet, still cannot get enough approval to satisfy the empty hole inside. He has unlimited vacation days, and his wife still left him. Bezos?

The two people I listed ARE MY ENTIRE support structure. You come in here and just make fucking assumptions.

"For real. If anything the movie highlights how men, as well as women, are victims (in different ways, obviously) of being brought up in a patriarchal society. 

Especially in a world that is just now shifting, at least in the Anglosphere, to something that is even *mildly* more balanced than things were even 50 years ago (hell even 20 years ago), young men are still being raised with examples of toxic masculinity everywhere around them. Ken‚Äôs infatuation with the examples of masculinity he came across in the real world was an all-too uncomfortable callback for me, reminding me of my friends‚Äô behavior growing up and especially my own behavior as well.

The movie served an excellent reminder that toxic masculinity also tries to force boys into unrealistic examples to strive for, both from a physical appearance perspective as well as an emotional/behavioral one, and that we should be seeking to deprogram the younger generation from these harmful stereotypes.

The movie was primarily about empowering women and highlighting the awful shit they have to deal with in society even today, but it also served a good reminder that only empowering women isn‚Äôt enough; if we don‚Äôt also change the narrative for young men, the erosion of toxic masculinity is delayed for another generation.",2023-07-23

The Montreal attack at √âcole Polytechnique was in 1989, so even before ""older millennials"" were really old enough to understand the mindset.

Personally, I thought the movie was saying to Ken (and those he represents) that you do not need attention from women or a Mojo Dojo Casa House or beach to be a complete human being, that you need to find yourself and what drives you and what gives you life. It was a positive message!

That‚Äôs the movie ‚Äúmen this men that blah blah‚Äù lol.

You didn't think it was just a _little_ bit muddled to spend the third act and much of the second attacking the concept of patriarchy, only for the woman at the end to dismiss the concept of patriarchy as ""something we make up to blame our problems on?""

It's not that it can't be explained, or interpreted, but the fact that it would require work to make sense of, when the movie had no problem devoting extensive time to a monologue detailing problems attributed to this framework, is at the very least a muddle.",2023-07-28
"I was happy with that to be honest. As troubling as the Kens‚Äô treatment was in the status quo, I was worried for a bit that the Kens were going to make it out of the final act with Barbieland becoming a fully egalitarian utopia.

Like yeah, obviously we should want a society where all differences (sex, gender, race, age, etc) don‚Äôt play a factor in your standing in said society‚Äîjust from a narrative standpoint, I‚Äôm glad that they didn‚Äôt go down that route (and honestly I shouldn‚Äôt have expected anything other than what we got).",2023-07-23

"And this Barbie movie is making sweeping statements about men and has a lot of men in it and it‚Äôs directed and written by a woman, so it‚Äôs just a female caricature of what men in the world are and how they act. What‚Äôs your point?

Getting married is an achievement and was in those days. Is an adventure story ending in lifelong love really so terrible a message in film? The movies also ending with the men getting married - to the women who were getting married. However Hitchcock acted off set is irrelevant to the content of his movies. The man‚Äôs been dead for more than 40 years I can‚Äôt get worked up about that.

Well then I guess Mansplaining is a good thing because apparently you don‚Äôt know much about Barbie or Mattel - Ruth Handler the created of Barbie wasn‚Äôt forced out of the company very early on by men she was in charge of it for decades. A simple google search will tell you that - ‚Äúshe served as the Mattel company's first president from 1945 to 1975‚Äù.

"I getchu, to me there was still a missing element of genuine connection between the Barbies.

"Haha, we'll have to agree to disagree. It was very much a movie that was about the female stars being stereotypically female as per myopic white feminism (with its lack of intersectionality, penchant for reinforcing the existing binaries, and the way that translates within the cinematic gaze as flat and uncompelling character development, hence considering some internalized misogyny). 

I don't expect Barbie to be radically feminist, but a Barbie movie sure as hell better be about Barbie's journey. Making a movie about Barbie with the focus predominantly on Ken's arc is hilariously ironic. Using a girls' franchise as a means to educate men? Women *already* educate the men in their lives! Even in the movie, Barbie still has to hand-hold Ken to his revelation. Greta didn't have the self-awareness to comment on that happening via another character. It's not very good satire when writers do a fake-out on tackling a dynamic. It's skin-deep feminism and social commentary. Still too unaware to keep it *that* real, though she came close at some points with the bit about the Kens wanting a Supreme Court justice appointment. 

If anything, it seems like Barbie was meant to be the WASP liberal feminist who thinks she's comprehending social dynamics and is capable of transcending them. That would have been more interesting if it was actually challenged.",2023-08-04

"I think this film was written to be accessible at different depths. I think at a surface level, the cafeteria is the loudest and most clear criticism in the film because the daughter comes out and says her criticism directly and with sincerity instead of humor. I feel the cafeteria scene was balanced against other scenes with the mom to guide viewers to a kind of ‚Äútwo sides of the story‚Äùconclusion, that Barbie has created both insecurity and empowerment in women. The more satirical scenes don‚Äôt have any silver lining or balanced defense of Mattel. When Will Ferrel says ‚ÄúI never see the bottom line‚Äù, my reading of that is basically ‚ÄúMattel only sees the bottom line and doesn‚Äôt give a shit about women‚Äù. Or the ‚Äújust call me mother‚Äù line = ‚ÄúMattel is a patriarchal organization that is appropriating femininity to market a product to women‚Äù.

And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a love interest in a movie for men - just like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with women having male characters as side love interests in movies which appeal to them. There‚Äôs plenty of romances and romantic comedies and Jane Austen where a man is just a side love interest for a female story. And that‚Äôs fine. Idk what you‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs a bad thing for men.

But even if what you were saying is true (it‚Äôs not) - you seem to think it‚Äôs a bad thing. So why would be repeating what was bad to do to women in the 60‚Äôs to men now be good? What kind of rationale is that?

Yeah perhaps everything done to the Kens has been done to women in the real world but what of it? If you‚Äôre trying to make the point that it‚Äôs bad then that point is lost with the mixed messaging of the movie with Kens being idiots compared to women and it not contrasting effectively with the real world women being portrayed so positively.

It's not a ""big deal"" in the sense that the society depicted in their books is what they literally strive for, mostly because it's impossible to do so. They have to be realistic. Rather, it shows feminists do think these matriarchal societies are the most ideal.

"Hi, I actually have experience in the toy market and this is my thought, because I also disagree that this is a ""kids movie"" after seeing it (I'd say 10+ imo, and 10-12 is dependent on how socially literate they are/strive to be)

The line of Barbie Movie specific dolls - the cowgirl, Plaid dress, president, Ken - are all $25+ ($25 or $50), which is a high price point for a single doll. IIRC the holiday collector Barbie is $50. And THAT'S the market - ""collector"". 

There's actually a LOT of adults buying toys , dolls specifically, because it's a collectible niche like Squishmallow, Funko Pop, etc. It kind of skates the line (as all those brands do) because they're definitely toys and kids can absolutely buy and enjoy them, but each brand also creates for adult collectors. 

The higher price point & some toy features indicate products being more collector-oriented while still living in the toy category and also being accessible to the primary consumer (kids). 

(For ex - movable joint Barbies used to be more often collector/""advanced"" Barbies because they were less sturdy / more delicate and probably pricier to make, but I think those are more common in play-line Barbie now).",2023-07-24

No it would not, it‚Äôs just that that particular ending in the movie is in line with feminist ideology of patriachy being bad for men and men getting to find themselves without it etc so some people are wetting themselves over it.",2023-08-02

Like I said the message was lost as the Kens and real world men are shown as dumber than women and morally worse. So why would you think the Kens should be in charge? They‚Äôre clearly worse than it than the barbies.,2023-08-03
"Thank you for sharing a clear cut example of ""bad criticism""

The real world men weren't dumb. I'd say Will Ferrell's character maybe but everyone else wasn't shown as such. 

Gloria's husband wasn't shown as dumb either, he was learning the language of his wife and child to be supportive. He was struggling with it maybe but at no point did they make him seem like a complete idiot. He's onscreen maybe like 8 seconds so thats really not a good example your demonstrating.

If the film was ""men bad men stupid"" then the logical ending would've been to banish the Kens from Barbieland and it be an only woman paradise. But instead Barbie realizes sge has sone responsibility in the way Ken was acting and that she treated him as what was expected of him, not as what he would want to actually be. She forgives him and apologizes for treating him so poorly, as does the rest of the other Barbies forgive the Kens and start to slowly have them take part in decisions in barbieland. She encourages Ken to be something more than what's expected of him, just like she wants the sane for herself. 

Like, I know for some people reading and media comprehension in English class was the part every skipped, and most of them became right wing outrage artists take everything at face value only, but it literally couldn't be spelled out any clearly. 

This is like the same willful ignorance people complained about with Glass Onion.  It's embarassing. 

""wig wrote all the real world men and Kens as dumb because she simply followed a lazy ‚Äúman dumb woman smart‚Äù trope and actually has a lot of bitterness toward men.""

It's why Stereotypical Barbie chooses to leave, because it's shallow, and she now knows what a complete but imperfect existence feels like.",2023-07-22
"They don't ""get emotional"", they get deprogrammed. They're dolls, not people. They don't have the capacity to understand the actual emotions behind Gloria's speech, it's just the antidote to the messaging brought from the real world.

Stereotypical Barbie doesn't gain that capacity until she goes to the real world, and that capacity is why she chooses to leave in the end.",2023-07-22
"I get the themes. If it were just about the stuff like the old woman it would have been nice. The woman on woman themes work well - it‚Äôs where Gerwig tries to deal with men that her bitterness and desire to make them the butt of the joke shines through. There is a lot of compassion for women in this movie so I can see how women would concentrate more on that and be more likely to overlook just how badly portrayed men are in this (as we can all overlook bad portrayals of those who aren‚Äôt like us or at least downplay them).But the reality is the portrayal of all the men in the film isn‚Äôt unlike old racist cartoons where members of a race were all stereotypical morons. It‚Äôs closer to that than any movie portrayal of women because, there is no movie that goes out it‚Äôs way to portray the entire female gender as negatively and as stupid as the Barbie movie does for men.


The real world patriachy and Kendoms are portrayed very negatively in a way the Barbie matriarchy never is. Men are portrayed negatively in a way women never are. So you say it‚Äôs a message of equality and not women should rule everything - but when you take into account the portrayal of the Barbies as competent great leaders and the men and Kens as morons - I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case at all. If it were Gerwig would have shown the Barbies as more incompetent and villainous ala the men but they are not. When you portray one group so positively and another so negatively whether they have power or not how can that be a message of equality? 

I understood the ending. It was just a lame ‚Äúbarbie don‚Äôt need no men‚Äù ending because it wouldn‚Äôt have been empowering enough for modern feminism to have Barbie actually like her boyfriend since like 1965.

The Barbie land ending of Ken also kind of echoed the feminist idea that patriachy is bad for men and when it‚Äôs gone they‚Äôll be able to cry and find themselves (even though most men don‚Äôt care) and women should be given more power and somehow that means equality. So I think the Barbie Land ending was an expression of that idea as well. It‚Äôs basically what a feminist woman would think should be a happy ending for a man whether or not he actually agrees.

So I‚Äôm not ragging on the other themes or the speeches about how women feel or the scene with the old woman, which are probably reasonably done - but in the midst of basically portraying all men as badly as racist old cartoons portrayed black people well yeah, it‚Äôs hard to be positive about it. And I know some will say that‚Äôs genius satire but I really don‚Äôt think it is. It‚Äôs just a lame ‚Äúman dumb woman smart‚Äù trope and echoing a negative sentiment about men which isn‚Äôt uncommon amongst some feminist types.

Tbh the fact there‚Äôs a Barbie movie which doesn‚Äôt just have a funny story and Barbie and Ken ending up together and that‚Äôs though of as the height of intellectualism and satire just shows the state of entertainment and media today. People in the 60‚Äôs or 70‚Äôs would have thought this movie was absolutely retarded and juvenile to try to be adult intellectual entertainment.",2023-07-25
"Just try not to be 'part of the problem' - in whatever way makes sense, more-or-less.

Maybe that means not outright staring at an attractive person for a 'weird' amount of time.

If you've notices a friend doing those things, maybe give 'em a heads up about *why not* to do those things.

They could have still been treated unfairly, and even sexualized or portrayed as accessories but the fact that they just ""forgot"" to vote was weird. Does that make sense? 

The writers could have found some other way for the Barbies to make sure the constitution doesn't change.
(Actually if only all the Barbies went to vote + Midge and Allan, the referendum wouldn't pass.)

If the movie was consistent in portraying Kens as women have been portrayed throughout the history of cinema I could still accept it. But it wasn't consistent and that's why it didn't sit right with me.

Edit: i saw a comment elsewhere here that stuck with me. This is a story of an oppressed group (kens) rising up (in a misguided way) and then being kinda ok with being less oppressed at the end. And the ruling class gains some empathy to their subjugates, but still wants to rule in the end.

Sorry to pick on you specifically but I'm seeing too many comments along the lines of ""Gerwig's allowed to be a feminist but she should really be nicer to men while she does it.""

Of course it is a commentary on our own unjust world. I left confused because this was a movie with constant speeches telling me women can change things and have power, but the actual message being *shown and highlighted through action in the film* was that woman don't have power, should not aspire to have power, and are just dumb.

If they had done a better job showing, rather than telling, that woman have a chance (whether they represented it with Ken or through Barbie) I would agree that it was trying to highlight change for rl issues, but it fell flat.

Tl;dr, they chose Ken as a symbol for how women are mistreated, which is already an odd choice, and that symbol became more important for representing the message and the theme than the actual female characters. Meanwhile, the actual female characters had flat plots and relied too much on telling over showing, leaving the overall message muddy.",2023-07-26

"Wrong and wrong. One being that queens existed? The other being that in the west white did not ‚Äúhold all the power‚Äù. There was a ruling class of nobility of the smallest portion of the population which held all the power who happened to be white in the west at least. The majority of these white men were poor peasants who lived under autocracies with little to no control over their daily lives. They did not have voting rights hell there was no democracy. It took entire revolutions before democratic ideals became established. In the US landless white males could not vote until somewhere in the 1840s. BOTH men and women have lacked power and control over their daily lives for centuries. While men did get those rights first, women got them soon shortly after.

If there‚Äôs one take away I‚Äôd want you to have it‚Äôs that the majority of men did not hold power for a very long time until recently. For most of these centuries you speak of, men didn‚Äôt hold power and were mostly peasants trying to feed their families.",2023-07-22

They don't. Women can't force a doctor to do something he/she doesn't want. A doctor only has to give life-saving support if someone is dying.

The law doesn't limit a woman getting her tubes tied - the difference is that some doctors just wont do it. The same way a doctor can refuse to do a vasectomy.

>Laws have been passed to allow rando pharmacists to deny contraceptives if they have a moral or religious objection.

How has that anything to do with bodily autonomy. What other people have to sell or not has nothing to do with your bodily autonomy. And are pharmacists only allowed to deny selling contraceptives to women? The topic was less bodily autonomy **than men**.

>Corporations are allowed to cut birth control pills from their insurance coverage.

Again that's not your bodily autonomy. Your bodily autonomy doesn't include getting to force other people to pay or sell you what you want.

>Men and corpses are allowed to deny the use of their organs, even if it would save the life of another.

Trying to argue that women have less bodily autonomy **than man** by using a medical procedure that men in general don't need as an example is dumb as fuck. Also abortion is not like other procedures because it includes the life of another human being - though that's not really important to the argument.

The joke is that Ken only cared about the patriarchy because he thought it was all about horses, but the original Barbieland was all in furtherance of women's empowerment.  Unless the sequel is about the Kens search for self-actualization, they got short shrift here.

And sure, the ""Kendom"" scenes were fun, but why is it played for jokes when men are interested in movies, or cars, or music. Like, the slam on the Zack Snyder Justice League was great, but is it really something to be laughed at when a guy likes Lou Reed and wants to share that interest?

For women, the message was clear (as told through America Ferrara's speech that was ripped off from Gone Girl). For men, I have no clue what Greta was trying to say.

"To be fair to you, it is perfectly fine if you don't like a movie or if in your opinion Barbie wasn't well-made.

That aside, objectively speaking, a lot of the movies you mentioned with female leads are still in the male gaze. To put it more simply, they just happen to star women. Gerwig's movies are ***about*** women.

Barbie **is** very in your face. They tell you right on your face that men often mansplain things women either didn't want/care to know, or already know (the finance bro, the tech bro...). The whole Godfather joke, the Kens-singing-at-Barbie joke, the Barbie vs feminism points (Sasha and her friends are meant to be Bratz dolls, that's clever), they are all meant to be explicit. When the movie Mattel is trying to be woke just because it sells, they know you know that the real Mattel is doing the exact same thing.

I would say that your gender does seem to weigh in on how you seem to evaluate women's experiences lol. Ik women as young as twelve getting catcalled (even Margot Robbie, if she got catcalled at 12, it'd be terrible). Most women are very familiar with stares, and most women will also tell you stories about how it became more than stares at least once in their life (unless they have lived a very sheltered life in which case, great for them honestly). This again was done explicitly by Greta to show people who have the mentality of Barbie that ""Oh sexism is solved because women can vote and shit"" that ""Hello...erm no.""

Perhaps some of the jokes cracked would make more sense if you actually lived through the experience? Even then, you can't blame a movie for having a target audience. It's like if someone went to watch Spider-Man Far From Home and said ""I don't get what the hype is about"", ignoring that they need to have a certain kind of knowledge about what the film is portraying in order to understand what the hype is about (loose example but you get what I mean hopefully).

"Am I not allowed to comment on why I didn‚Äôt like the movie? Isn‚Äôt this thread for opinion on the movie?

Anyhow to answer your question on how it‚Äôs anti men - Every man in it is written and portrayed as an idiot or an idiot villain and the butt of the joke, all male interests are mocked as are males talking about them, this is not true of the Barbies or real world women. On top of that in spite of people saying the Barbieland matriachy  is a contrast with the real world the Barbie land matriarchy is never shows in the stupid and overtly villainous light as the real world patriarchy or Kendom, so keeping that in mind it can only seem to suggest that women do a better job in charge.

I think after decades of man dumb woman smart sitcom tropes and the past decade of cringey Tik Tok and Instagram style man hating feminist reels and whatever else, that the obvious idiotification and bashing of an entire gender doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal to a lot of women is a problem.

 The Barbie movie is basically does the equivalent of what old racist cartoons of the 40‚Äôs did to black people - portrays them all as morons who are doing the wrong thing while the white people, or women in the Barbie movie, are all clever and rounded and generally much more competent. Those old cartoons were defended for decades as light hearted fun that only someone taking life too seriously should have a problem with as well. And no saying the Barbie movie is satire does not excuse this.

If a movie which portrayed women as negatively for comedy purposes and to send a message came out women would absolutely hate it and there would be campaigns to have it banned. And no mainstream studios would green light it in the first place.

But I‚Äôm not ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù as you try to dismiss me as being - I‚Äôm talking about why a movie which negatively portrays men in this way is so bad. Aside from that I also think the movie kind of sucked as a story and has a lot of other things wrong with it.",2023-07-26

That's the point. That is emotional maturity.

Emotional maturity isn't doing everything women want, it's saying ""motorcycle rides are important to me, I understand it worries you but this is the life I want to live and if you can't live with someone who likes riding, well it might just not work out"" instead of lying to yourself, selling your motorcycle, and then being resentful of your girlfriend because she made you give up a passion.

I think it‚Äôs fine to be nostalgic for those young days - which is maybe what they were trying to get at? The idea that parents are attached to this fun, youthful innocence that young children have when playing with toys. But all children grow up, and children don‚Äôt exist for your entertainment. I think it‚Äôs great and interesting and fun when children start to try out their own ideas about the world - like the teenager was doing in the school scene - even if it is a little extreme. Those are the building blocks of who this person will become one day. 

And I think that this is actually a really nuanced conversation to have about teenage girls - when are these girls afforded the privileges of being seen and treated as an adult, which girls get this privilege, at what points do we continue to infantilize tween/teen girls for our own comfort?",2023-07-21

"Yea, it looks very much like a joke about mansplaining. The thing with mansplaining is it's a man condescendingly explaining something to a woman who already knows it. 

Except the conceit here is that great movies like the ""godfather"" or nerding out about stock market/trading was never present in Barbieland when the Barbie's were in charge. They were very much new things  brought in by the kens when they ""awoke"".

So yes, can be superficially viewed as laughing at mansplaining but on closer look it's basically saying a women led world wouldn't really be interested much in nerdy cultural areas.",2023-07-30
"The co-writer of this film is Noam Bauchman, who's biggest influence is Woody Allen (i.e., clever writer that didn't much bother with feminism).

Maybe I'm giving him too much credit but Barbieland was positive only on a very superficial level. On closer look it was intellectually dead. 

This kinda reminds me of starship troopers. Where the future looks very cool even though it makes more sense to view it as a satire on fascism. It can be hard to miss since so much of it overlaps with the current reality of the audience. 

The big speech that apparently broke the brainwashing looks genuine since that thought is mainstream, but it was almost intentionally made to be an incoherent rambling. Lots of people are viewing it as ""cringe"" when really I think its best to view it as satire on modern feminism. 

Likewise, the master plan in destroying kendom involved the Barbie's explicitly being told what real women do, which is blatent manipulation of men to get what they want (lol). I mean, I'm sure on an emotional lots of people liked that, but their probably oblivious to the message they are actually endorsing. 

Another example is in the end. Where the CEO's instantly accept her idea on a future line the second they learn its profitable. They didn't become enlightened on women to accept her plan. Any idea that sells works. .",2023-07-30

"The film only deals in subtext, there is little to no conventional narrative text. If thats what weak writing that‚Äôs your option, cool. There‚Äôs more than one way to write a film, its not a subjective exercise. 

The messaging isn‚Äôt convoluted. But it is complicated, because Barbie is a doll made in the image of real women and woman are complicated just like all people. 

Not that hard to follow when you follow the subtext, the films not exactly subtle about it. 

The films message is very clear that there are  no good guys or bad guys, we‚Äôre all impacted negatively under any gender term e ding with an ‚Äòarchy‚Äô suffix. 

Ken has a break down because he lives under a suppressive matriarchy, Barbie has one when she‚Äôs exposed to the horrors of the real world patriarchy. It‚Äôs all bad, humans are the victims, the systems are the villains. Very clear. 

Not sure about your fixation on the real men appearing dumb? The husband is literally learning the second language?? Sure will Farrell and the board are goofy but that‚Äôs got more to do with making fun of capitalism and corporate America. So it‚Äôs not exactly punching down. 

And the Kens are very clearly only ‚Äúdumb‚Äù because they live under a matriarchy that smothers their identity, limits their potential, and expects nothing from them. Hence all the existential crisis stuff Kens goes through. 

Your last point makes no sense, or you failed to understand mine. Obviously it isn‚Äôt the 60s, Barbieland is very clearly in step with our timeline because the dolls are indeed very diverse. 

Barbie was invented in 1959. So Barbieland can only have existed for 64 years. Just 64 years of ‚Äògrowth‚Äô or change can have occurred. 

The modern Women‚Äôs suffrage moment has been in motion since the early 18th century and there‚Äôs only been 6 women on the Supreme Court today. (Only use it this example because the film does) 

So with that breadth of time in mind, and knowing that Ken is an allegory for real world women, its still going to take a good while for any serious change to manifest in their society.

Merely mentioned the decade to give an indication of how many years behind their world is by nature of its relativity recent inception.",2023-07-23

There‚Äôs also the dating scene that expects the man to pay for everything and casually overcome 80% of women exclusively going for top 20% of guys. Divorce court that heavily favors women for child custody. High paying STEM field starving for more female applicants and hiring basically any of them with mildly competent education.

What do you take the message to be?,2023-07-23
">The message in this movie is so on the nose I think it'd make an old Soviet propogandist say ""ehhhh this is a little too much.""


Perhaps it's because you see yourself in the message?

Here's the deal. I'm a husband, about to have a daughter, what about the message, don't you agree with?

I speak for all men when I say I'd give my life 100 times over for my family. Perhaps you haven't reached that point in your life yet, but women are our mothers, our sisters, our cousins, our kids. Even if Barbie was bashing womens rights over your head, over and over again, surely it's a bad thing that it HAS to do that. The world is that fucked that they still can't catch a break.

I think it's message was justfied very well with the real world evidence we all can vouch for. That scene where Barbie was describing how she felt completely vulnerable and open to attack while Ken was just loving every minute of it is a play by play into the lives of every single women that exists right now. Not even can they trust the damn police not to do something unspeakable to them.

Like, the movie is so ham-fisted, because it's a damn accurate portrayal of being a women, and I thought the ending was completely spot on with the ""deprogramming"" scenes and that monologue of describing what it was like.",2023-07-23

"It paints that way because they were co-dependant. Think back to how women were perceived in the 40s-50s. Just a dumb blonde, stupid housewife, dependant on their husbands. It's the role reversal. Then when they tried to claim their power back they went too far and made their whole personality about their masculinity and their power and it became toxic. In the same way that women who go too far and become a feminism or guys become incels or obsessed with alpha beta culture, become toxic. It wasn't until they realised they could be individuals and found equilibrium that the balance started to restore. And like the real world, there is not equality yet, nor in barbie land.

"The point was that this thing that feminism claims men want but are held back by patriarchy from doing - to cry more and express their feelings etc, which is presented in the movie as Ken crying at the end and going off to find himself - 99% of men don‚Äôt actually care about it at all and don‚Äôt want that, it‚Äôs something feminist women say men want and then use as an argument for why feminism is good for men etc etc

And no this has nothing to do with not centering men equally which no men expect in a Barbie movie - if anything they should have spent less time obsessing about men in the movie. It has to do with the reality that literally every man and male interest in the movie is portrayed as a joke and the women are not. Something which women would hate done to them also, but now we have feminists making up false reasons for why men don‚Äôt like the movie like it not centring them. Which is bs.

And no, feminism was not invented to help men find themselves or whatever lol, actually feminism was invented as an idea by a socialist man as a subset of socialism which would deal with women in a theoretical socialist society.

"There‚Äôs films and books where female characters have complexity and those we‚Äôre they don‚Äôt. So what? It‚Äôs fine for women to be side characters in male stories sometimes. Men are in women‚Äôs stories women just don‚Äôt perceive it that way. How many women‚Äôs stories from Jane Austen to twilight to 50 shades have some broody guy whose either rich or supernatural in some way and is very generic (not that women notice)? Loads. And I don‚Äôt care about that at all. It‚Äôs fine, just like it‚Äôs fine for men. What‚Äôs not fine is making every one of the many characters of a gender to be a idiot or an idiot and a villain.

As I said I expected Barbie to be all about women (probably would have been better if it focused more on women instead of obsessing about men and the patriarchy actually). I expected girl power. I didn‚Äôt expect the obvious sense of misandry hidden under a thin veneer or a social critique on equality which shone through in the movie.

And obviously things had stereotypically gender roles in the past as that was all people knew. You can hardly paint that as some terrible thing when nobody even cared about it (including women) until the last century or less.

Is this academic discourse on Hitchcock films by feminist types by chance? Sounds like it. So the women get rescued? And? Why is that bad? Would it be bad if a woman rescued a man? I just watched Rope and strangers on a train the other week and no women were rescued in those. Also I would hardly call gangly awkward Jimmy Stewart who stars in many Hitchcock movies the ‚Äúarchetypical hero‚Äù nor Bruce Dern as a cabbie nor many others. 

And I‚Äôve already seen Marnie and it ruled, not misogynistic at all. Underrated gem! Whatever his treatment of Tippi Hendren (which I gather was some form of sexual harrasment or inappropriateness) it‚Äôs hardly going to effect how I watch his movies now seeing as he‚Äôs been dead for more than 40 years.

The movie is called Barbie because the whole franchise is named after Barbie and calling it something else would spoil the story. 

The fact that it's actually more Ken's story was kinda the point of the movie, because the trailers made it seem like it was about Barbie alone while the main conflict is actually about Barbie's and Ken's roles and relationship to each other. 

Saying that Barbie only cares about her feet and Ken about his whole purpose doesn't make sense, the whole plot is that those events were intertwined and that Barbie didn't realize until things went wrong for her that Ken was miserable as well.  Sure, that made her the bad guy and Ken a victim, but they ended up acknowledging each other's struggles and start to live their own lives.

"> Sure. The theme behind Barbie as a doll was as Ruth said - a way for girls to aspire to be more than just mothers, as the opening sequence also explained. This meant Barbie literally thought she had changed the world for girls for the better, so after hitting rock bottom and realizing that she‚Äôs instead viewed as just another tool of the patriarchy (by Gloria‚Äôs daughter and others), she decides that after revolutionizing her own world, she wants to do even better and being an impact to not just the outside world, but to herself, as she has now fully realized that she is more than just a doll - she is Barbie.
To talk about the ‚Äúmen‚Äù theme people keep spitting out, others are saying the whole Ken sequence was him discovering in an ironic way that men in Barbieland don‚Äôt have to just be dumb himbos meant to swoon all the Barbies - almost like how girls in the real world used Barbie to see how they don‚Äôt have to be just mothers and trophies for men. There‚Äôs no actual ‚Äúmisandry‚Äù involved in conveying this, it‚Äôs quite literally just a genderbent story of equal rights that ends with everyone deciding they should live their lives freely of how they were initially designed.

>I've seen too much pain, misery and literal life threatening things happen to women who have no own money what so ever and fully depend on their husband that tend to abuse the power he has

And I've seen guys get the Johnny Depp treatment where they are blackmailed (usually into giving money) or they will be accused of SA. If a woman is being abused physically or financially there is the police and there are women's shelters and there are online fundraising options.

There seems to be this myth that all men are abusers and all women are victims. When men are abusers society drops the hammer on their nuts, and rightly so. But when women are the abusers nobody seems to care. There are no movies or TV shows or political lectures about how women cheat or manipulate men where it's also seen as a negative (quite the opposite).

Bullshit. Most men wouldn't just treat women like dogs because that is not how most men would want to treat women in the first place.

Men may not have respected their inputs when they tried to interject themselves into fields that men had been working in for a very long time(aka, womensplaining) but that certainly does not mean that they just treated them like dogs. This is revisionist history. 


> Marriage was typically not about valuing women, but about controlling them

Bullshit. Men loved women as much then as they do now. It was never about controlling them, and this false narrative that men just sought to control women is incredibly harmful. It is just poison, and more revisionist history, which seeks to further enable women in their bigotry and extremism towards women.

Also, most of those abusive men were chosen by women, and a lot of that abuse came from a lack of support for men's issues at the time. In some situations, it was also because we lived in a society that failed to hold women accountable for their actions, and husbands/fathers were expected to take accountability for their wive's misbehavior. Men were often punished in lieu of women, which then led to certain men becoming more abusive in response. Abuse against women was still, however, regarded as immoral and illegal. 

Men also most certainly had to develop a strong, cold and violent disposition in order to even attract women. Gentle men still are, to this day, often viewed as weak, cowardly, unmasculine and unworthy of a woman's affection. That hasn't changed either. 

>And men did things for themselves, what is this bullshit about doing it for women? 

Invaders fought wars to provide resources and wealth for the women of their countries, or to end a threat before it reaches their home countries. Invadees fought to protect the women of their countries, so that they wouldn't become victims of war. You're also really missing the point if you're going to go pick one example that you think harms women. Men worked so that they could provide a home and life for their wives and children. Men took roles of leadership because that was the role that women expected of them(they were labelled all kinds of nasty things if they weren't, much like they still are now). Men created societies and laws to protect and support women. 

>Human history is cruel to anyone without power. 

Human history is far more cruel to men than it was to women, but you just won't read about it because no one cared for the men who suffered.

> And for boys like you, it is threatening to live in a world where people are treated equally

Quite the opposite. I would love to see a world of equality. The problem is that you have people like you, who are either completely blind or who have a very twisted view about equality, trying to make the rules. It's like you're trying to blindly balance a scale, that was already completely slanted in your favor, because you can't even recognize just how good you actually have it. You are effectively capitalizing on male disposability, to further a cause of misandry and female chauvinism. There is nothing equal about that.",2023-07-24

"Women are bad guys when they bully weird Barbie, when they don't even consider kens as people and when the daughter rips Barbie to shreds.

It seems like you do get the point - everything is an outgrowth from this idea of what if we make men the accessories, a reversal of the dominant portrayal in media where a woman exists only in the context of a man. Where they exist only for the man's gaze and validation. 

I found the execution of this idea lacking but to be upset and see it as a man hating movie is pretty absurd and imo says more about your fragility than anything else. The whole point of Barbie land is that it is not for it to be representative of the ideal real world where parity exists between men and women but rather a place that exists for the uplift of women. 

Yes all the men in the movie are stupid. But think of the countless movies where women are mindless objects for the desires are stories of men. Also men aren't exactly an oppressed class of people and should be able to understand the point without their fragile egos frying.",2023-08-06

"I'm confused why you are going out of your way to state that the Barbie movie is putting down men. Have you watched Barbie? The whole point of the movie is for ""the perfect world where the roles are reversed"". Young girls are only able to play with baby dolls, in the way that is meant to imply that you are only to be a mother. With Barbie, you are meant to be anything. It's meant to break social stereotypes. Barbies take the roles that are often seen by men (ex. construction workers, lawyers, doctors, politicians) and work them while their ""Ken"" is meant to represent them only being accessories & have been assigned to a Barbie which their lives involve around. In Barbieland, everything is perfect. Is the movie calling you a sexist pig? That you follow the sad laws of society that only really input to men? No, but it is meant for you to see that a woman in today's society is practically only seen as a sex object (ex. in the movie when the men hit on Barbie & Ken, and she states ""Well I don't have any genitals""). She was a shallow, consumer symbol that caters to the male gaze and encourages unrealistic expectations of women. Pro-femme films are always going to be shit on by an audience since people are subjected to their own opinion, though instead of focusing on how it ""made the men look"" look more at the social standards of the submissive roles, docile housewives, and long distant, low term, casual girlfriends. At the end of the day, the movie wasn't made to highlight ""the male struggles"" you mention above. It's meant to showcase the female struggle, and in general, how unrealistic today's world is. By you shitting on the movie, you're unironically shitting on today's society as a whole which is run by generational power.",2023-08-05

"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay that the Kens were treated the way they were in the sense that realistically, no one should be. I don‚Äôt think anyone was supposed to. I think the point of the movie was to upset misogynistic people since they think it‚Äôs okay to treat women the way the Kens were treated. Personally, I believe everything in the film was very intentional. I also don‚Äôt think they needed to make it more clear that the Barbie‚Äôs were in the wrong tbh. It should have been obvious that some of what they were doing was wrong. 

If the movie had made all the white Barbie‚Äôs bad because of POC being treated badly, I honestly as a white woman, would not care. I‚Äôm assuming it would only be done to prove a point just like it was with the Barbies and Kens. And just to make sure this is clear, I think how the Kens were treated in the context of the movie was okay because it was to show how women (in movies and irl) are treated. 

If real men were actually treated the same way women are, then no that wouldn‚Äôt be okay.",2023-07-23
"Why is your response to a film about women‚Äôs struggles that men have struggles too? Everyone knows that. 

Yes, more men have died in war than women. Why do you think that is? Could part of the reason be that women weren‚Äôt even allowed to be in the military for a long time? And even now when they do, they‚Äôre treated poorly by the men, so why would more want to join? 

I definitely think suicide and homelessness (this also effects a large number of lgbt+ people btw) are big problems that everyone should be working towards solving. I don‚Äôt think using them to invalidate women‚Äôs struggles is a very fair though. No one is saying men don‚Äôt have problems. Things are still generally easier for them than they are for women. If you really want to get into it, we can also look at how many women die from domestic abuse, pregnancy complications, and how men try to control our bodies.",2023-07-23
"It‚Äôs hard to do when someone clearly put no effort into understanding the film. 

Barbieland is a reverse of the real world though. The Kens are used to represent how women are treated. It‚Äôs wild to me how (mostly) men are upset about how the film treats men and can‚Äôt comprehend that‚Äôs how women are actually treated.

The whole point of the movie was encapsulated in this line basically: ""Maybe one day Kens can have the same kind of power women in the real world do!""

The Kens weren‚Äôt taken seriously and treated the way they were because that‚Äôs how it is for women.",2023-07-23

Would you consider a pro-man film with similar themes to be right wing propaganda or is that fine because it's the status quo?,2023-07-26
"You sound like a very insufferable person to have so many opinions on how the movie is without even watching it, basing your entire narrative around what other people told you to think. Did you know that it shows how Ken struggles with the patriarchy and finding his place in it? No? It's because Ken is always just Ken. To be fair, Ken eventually admits he lost real interest in patriarchy once he found out it wasn't really about horses, it was confusing at first. But Ken doesn't get to do fun things like Barbie does because little girls are playing with him, not adults. Ken does not get to drive Barbies convertible, ask any little girl. Ken does not make decisions. Ken is Barbie's sidekick when you are a 6 yo girl and he is only there to keep pretend play moving along. A lot of the satire and comedy in the film is based off how little girls played with Barbie and Ken dolls. I related to it because I played the same way, with my own dolls and my daughter's dolls. I did take my 6 year old to it as well and she couldn't tell you what feminist or the patriarchy is. She just thought it looked cool, everything went over her head that she didn't get. Kids are like that, things usually just fly right by if they don't understand.

You also have zero right to say anything about being a woman at work. It's not that much better now, companies are just better at hiding it. To quote Bojack Horseman, ""Everyone loves a male feminist. It turns out, the problem with feminism, all along, is it just wasn't men doing it. We're much less shrill."" This is the type of shit that is why it's still a problem. Imagine being a manager and telling your subordinate what to do for their job, but you can't be too nice because you're a pushover but you can't be too stern because then you're a bitch. But when someone isn't doing their job and you are reminding them to cut it out and work, well then you're just being naggy. Oh, and coming in without makeup one day means you must be tired and need to get some rest. Heaven forbid you show yourself looking not put together by wearing nothing on your face. But maybe you like to wear makeup because it makes you feel good to look good, well we all know those women just got the job solely because of that reason, obviously she is only a boss because she looks good. Go get a vagina and listen to the big boys tell you how to do things the right way, then tell me how easy it is to be a woman and that nobody ever picks them apart. Again, no wonder you struggle as an adult. You go into life with that attitude you are going to be miserable.

Edit to also point out your audacity at saying a movie marketed as a COMEDY is at fault for being light hearted. WTF is that even supposed to mean? It's not a drama, it's not Oppenheimer, it's fucking BARBIE. A CHILD's toy. In a comedy.  And you act like it's supposed to address feminism and the patriarchy like some of political message?

"You‚Äôre right, I was overly harsh and I apologise. If you‚Äôre honestly asking in good faith, I think Buffy did a great job promoting strong women. It was groundbreaking and ahead of its time. That being said, the show was created by a pretty shitty guy who masqueraded as a feminist hero in public while cheating on his wife and abusing the actresses who worked for him. For the most part, Buffy has aged very well but it‚Äôs still guilty of playing into some harmful tropes and there are elements of the feminist messaging that don‚Äôt stand the rest of time.

To answer the rest of your question, I don‚Äôt think Barbie does make men look weak or incompetent. There‚Äôs a really important message about how patriarchy as a system harms men as well as women. Ken arguably has just as big of a character arc and journey of self discovery as Barbie does. He starts off as an accessory to Barbie, his only purpose in life is to be near her. In the real world, he learns about patriarchy and loves the idea of a society where men (and horses) are powerful and in charge. He goes back to barbie land to turn it into a patriarchy but it still doesn‚Äôt make him happy. Instead of defining himself as Barbie‚Äôs boyfriend, now he defines himself by his house and his car and his clothes and possessions. All he wants in life is a sense of identity and to feel needed and wanted and powerful but instead, the system that he himself has put in place holds him back and imposed strict roles on him that he doesn‚Äôt want. He only becomes truly happy when he starts looking inward to define and accept himself for who he is as a person and realises that he‚Äôs Kenough. There‚Äôs a really sweet message in there about how society hinders men from living as their authentic selves because of the roles we as a society place on men as well as women. All too often men are defined by how much money they make and how many beautiful women they have around them instead of who they are as human beings. The whole Andrew Tate idea of hyper masculinity encourages men to be as shallow and materialistic as possible and then blames women for expecting them to be rich alpha males.

Ken isn‚Äôt an idiot because he‚Äôs a man, he‚Äôs an idiot because he‚Äôs a doll with a child like mind who doesn‚Äôt understand the real world. When he goes back to barbie land, he single handedly transforms it from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. The barbies go from presidents and Nobel prize winning scientists to maids and housewives in the time it takes for Barbie to get back. Does that mean that women are being portrayed as weak and incompetent? No, it means that the barbies and kens are children‚Äôs toys.

The message of the movie isn‚Äôt ‚Äòmen bad, women good‚Äô, it‚Äôs that humanity is complicated and messy and we put systems in place that harm us all.",2023-07-23

"The US didn't have a woman on the Supreme Court until the 1980s, about 200 years after the Supreme Court was created. Barbieland has been introduced to the idea of equality for about 5 minutes. The entire point of the scene was the progress takes time, even after the problem has been acknowledged.",2023-08-22
"I felt the same way.

The parallels between the Barbies and the patriarchy are pretty obvious. Barbies are the Patriarchy of the Barbie Land. The Matriarchy, I guess? Barbie-archy?

And the Barbies learn the hard way that being treated unfairly sucks. Barbie enters the real world and she's treated like shit. Ken brings the Patriarchy back to the Barbie world and all of the Barbies are miserable. 

And they resolve that by... overthrowing the Ken's and putting themselves back in power...? The Barbie-archy resumes itself, bringing us right back to the status quo.

I thought for sure there would be a little twist in there. Especially when Barbie realizes she doesn't know where Ken lives. I thought he'd give his little speech, and the Barbies would have that moment of realization that maybe their Barbie-Centric society wasn't the fairest to the Ken's either, much like how normal society isn't always the fairest to women either. And then the Ken's and Barbie's would learn to treat each other with respect and live happily ever after.",2023-07-30

"Well, the point of the movie isn't ""Men=bad, women=good"". Nobody should be opressed period. The Barbie society isn't perfect, it LOOKS like a paradise, but it isn't, and just because Barbie won at the end doesn't mean, that this society will immediately fix all of its problems and get a perfect happy ending. It will take decades for Kens to slowly get all the rights they deserve, just like it happened in real life for women.

">aren‚Äôt interested in a fair society but rather ones where women rule

Yes that is the entire fucking point, because this is what happens in the real world in reverse. The movie is a social critique, not a happy ever after, that would completely defeat the point of the film which is that we don't have a happy ending. 

Ending the film by wrapping it all in a nice little bow so people can leave happy and think everything is solved would hilariously undermine the point of the film",2023-09-02
"I left the movie with the impression that the Ken's situation will improve over time, just like with women in the real world.  There will be a time where there will be 4 Ken's in the Supreme Barbie Court, just not now.

One of the best ways to wake people up, is by showing a parallel reality, with roles reversed - this was what this movie intended to do. Not a retribution, but a wake up call, that this shit is not fine, it shouldn't be taken as a norm.",2023-07-25

">You've convinced yourself you're a victim of society, and maybe that's true. But WE ALL ARE.

Wife left him. Big house. Didn't matter. Bill gates? Also got divorced. If status, success, and money are all that matters, why are they all so alone and unhappy?

First you don't know if they are alone/unhappy or not. Second, I never said that ""status, success, and money"" matters (i do not cast a moral judgement) I just said that they are important determinants of self worth in our society and you don't get to choose it. Third, ""You've convinced yourself you're a victim of society, and maybe that's true. But WE ALL ARE."" is exactly my point.

>Yeah, you don't get a pass to be a jerk incel by bringing up the potential lack of free will. We all have that same ""lack of free will"" and MOST of us aren't shit heads about women. Nice try changing the subject though.

I don't try to change the subject at all. This is very on topic with my first comment underlying that you don't necessarily choose what determines you self worth. That you read it as an excuse of misogynistic behavior says more about you than me. It's not because you don't have free will (or limited free will) that you have no responsibility. I never claimed that...

Thank you for sharing your personal experiences but I don't think that they are relevant to the discussion. That you think your sources of self worth have changed (they have not really changed that are just different situated expressions of a reduced number of fundamental needs) doesn't mean that YOU changed them. Access to women is important for a man's self worth because we are bombarded with titillating content or power couples imagery. That you think you escaped that (which I doubt) does not make it untrue.

"Just got back from seeing the movie. I think that the male characters in both the real world and in Barbieland were portrayed in sort of a similar way to the Barbies at the beginning of the film. We first see the Barbies as these perfect, ultra-feminine girlbosses only to realize that this ""perfect"" world is really harmful to some of the people both within (and without) of Barbieland. Even though Barbieland has unrealistic beauty standards and is full of toxic positivity, Barbie sees it as a perfect place due to her surface-level view of the world.

Ken experiences something similar when he steps out into the real world. He only sees the good. Instead of perfect pink houses and a female president, he sees horses and Bill Clinton. He latches onto these things, as do all the other Kens, despite the fact that not all of the Kens really *want* that sort of life, just like not all of the Barbies (mainly Stereotypical Barbie) don't want the lives that they were given. We see that, regardless of the patriarchy that he established, Gosling's Ken was never really happy, because he still felt empty inside.

Also, while the real world men were hardly portrayed well, from the random catcallers to the Matell board, I don't believe that this was meant to offer an objective view of the world as a place full of evil men. One of moments that the ""outside world"" really grounds itself is when Barbie is sitting on the bench and looking around at the world from a distance. She sees the trees, a couple fighting, and then a man just holding his head in his hands. The men in this world aren't all just having a great time, but from the perspective of Barbieland it might seem that way at first.

But even the Mattel board isn't portrayed as happy in the end. Ferrell talks about how he sometimes wishes that he could tickle-fight with his mates, and I feel that this was a wonderful way to show just how touch-starved and isolated a lot of men can feel due to how our culture sees certain things like tickling and holding hands as okay for female friends but not okay for men. And for the Mattel guys, that closeness wasn't found within the bounds of romantic love, but between male friends. I felt that it was a lovely addition to Ken's resolution, where he realized that he didn't need a woman to be whole.

Can't believe I just wrote an essay on this movie. I didn't even like it, but I also don't believe that the film was un-nuanced in its portrayal of men.",2023-08-19

You are not in love with love, you saw Peter Parker get married to a model and think you deserve that too, without wondering if you bring anything more to the table than a vague idea of loyalty. Any good relationship is already loyal. Do you have a smile that makes that 1 in 1000 girl swoon? Even if its a dorky one she cant help but find cute? Do you make her laugh? Do you help create good times for you both? Do you want to wake up to her in the morning without her makeup or hair done as she breathes morning breath in your face? Do you want to alternate cleaning the toilet you both shit in? That's what life is. You don't think of women as people, just an object of desire.

I think being 24 and having no love or relationships of course, will do horrible damage to you. I have a lot of empathy for your position (despite you having seemingly none for the woman's perspective..) Loneliness is soul crushing, there is no doubt about it. And loneliness is increasing so much in our world. Our society is changing for the worse in that regard.

Women do go through this too. 

You sound like you're in a horribly dark place. It doesn't have to be like this. 

When you look out at the world and think that everyone hates you, that's actually just you. YOU hate you. And you're projecting that onto everyone else.

At least, that's how I was! Just speaking from experience.

It's not just women that say this about men but men ourselves and for a long time, if you actually were cultured or learned or literate. It's male scholars and thought leaders and novelists and philosopers and political leaders and activists and artists... for a very long time. Feminism is also for men too. Its an ideology and movemen, dude. Its not created by women for women soley.... i hope you know that or this conversation will die quickly. 

>but there‚Äôs also simple politics surrounding custody laws or whatever else regarding men, plenty of the gender specific concerns of men aren‚Äôt focused on relationships at all

And who, pray tell, came up with those structures and ideals and why??? It's almost as if the patriarchy indeed hurts everybody??

>See the mistake you‚Äôre making is thinking that some teenage boys looking for advice on picking up girls is ‚Äúfocusing their entire personality on women

No, I'm fully aware that boys are into girls and want to be with them? But what compels so many boys and men to feel worthless with the love or attention of a woman? Why does that mean they hate women so much they will actively take away their rights? But you want to complain about a fictional fantasy movie of matriarchy?

No Barbie and Ken is never thought of together typically. Thats the point of the humor of the movie! Ken is very much not popular and has never been. They literally discontinued him briefly. Little kids rarely played with Kens. The humor of the movie and why it plays off gender politics so well is built into the franchise's history itself. If this movie had been a typical Barbie movie where its Barbie and her friends doing shit while the men are left behind, conservatives would still be mad that the ""Kens are pointless in Barbie Land"". No shit. It's how it's always been. 


>feminist fantasy that really only resonates with feminist women, because as I said, it‚Äôs their fantasy become ideology.

""Fantasy turned ideology."" My brother, I'm trying to keep this convo civil but you and these comments are starting to send me 

Yes, that's right this movie's message is how ""Barbie doesn't need Ken"" and it is that way because that's what Barbie and Ken's dynamic has always been like. It's why Ken doesn't have a job or a car or a dream house. The Barbie world is inherently matriarchal and feminist. Ken mirrors women in our real world who have to fight for power and rights and privilege and agency. Yeah, thats why Greta wants boys and men to pay attention to the Kens and their story. Its like you dumb misogynists can't understand that a critique of patriarchy isn't some instant ""we hate men"" bash(and since women just lost their right to choose, maybe feminism was right all along and maybe we should actually out the patriarchy more aggressively??). You claim this movie bashes men but reject it's message that men are fine on their own and don't need women to affirm their sense of self (again more humor is tied to the brand  history). No this isn't gonna be a damn love story about Barbie and Ken because that's never what Barbie has been about.

"I never said that crying is a negative experience. I said the scene in question showed Barbie as scared. Because it did.

Yes, she eventually leaves. That was not her intention the entire time. She literally willingly goes to Mattel and then willingly gets into the box. Did you watch the movie?

She did not decide to become human until the end of the movie. How is that patently false? You literally agree with me in your ""this is patently false"" rebuttal. She didn't know she could become human. So how could her character journey be ""Barbie wants to become human"" ?

She went to Mattel to complain about the human world and to speak to someone in charge. When she realizes there isn't a woman in charge - SHE LITERALLY RETURNS TO BARBIE WORLD. I don't know what your argument is. Let's phrase it a different way - if you could go to Barbie World, would you?

""How long is she supposed to be there"" ? That depends. In this movie, she is there for just long enough to move the Ken plot forward. If this was a movie about Barbie, she'd probably have been in the real world for longer. But the movie is about Ken, not about Barbie. Which - is my complaint.

You write that Barbie had changed a great deal when she returned to Barbie World, and yet the second Barbie World phase is to... return Barbie World to normal. That's not change. 

I don't think ""Ken"" still being a doll has any impact on the movie. Which is part of the point where Barbie becoming human has no impact on the movie. ""Ken"" as a character has changed. Barbie has not. 

Do you want your Barbie movie to be about men? Because that doesn't seem right. I think there's a lot to say about movie directed and (half) written by Greta Gerwig still being a movie focusing on and seen through a male lens. There's an idea out there that, because female artists are taught in a chain that begins with a man, there is no truly ""female"" art. I think you can make that argument about Barbie. What we are given, in a movie about a little girl's toy, in a movie covered in so much pink it depleted the world's supply of it, in a movie focused on women - is a movie about a man. I think that says something about the efforts we still have yet to accomplish in regards to feminism, equality, and the realities of the ""human world"" more than the Barbie movie itself ever made.",2023-08-06

"Yeah that‚Äôs totally fair if we don‚Äôt agree.

I think you make a really good point about Barbie handholding Ken to his revelation, though, and I made a comment to my friend after watching the movie that Ken got off pretty light considering how terrible he was.

But what I also do find fascinating about Ken in this movie is that he really experiences all angles of the problem - he starts off the movie as the role that women often get pigeonholed into as someone who is really just an accessory to someone of the more powerful sex, then he goes down the incel type rabbit hole, becomes a massive misogynist, gets tricked into fighting people with a common goal due to fear mongering, then in the end eventually does learn that he needs to find value in himself outside of the context of just his relationship to women.

There‚Äôs so many little parts of his story line that many different types of people could take something out of

But back to the ending, like I said, because of how cartoonishly evil Ken was during the movie, it feels almost gross how kind Barbie is to him in the end. But we also cant really forget how the Barbies themselves didn‚Äôt really have any interest in creating an equal world at the beginning of the movie.

">and thought the biggest gender-based issue the movie raised

I never said that ken being treated like a second class citizen was the biggest gender-based issue raised by the movie. It was just one of the many problems and child-like attempts at gender-based issues presented by this movie. 

> that‚Äôs worse than any treatment of women throughout history

The treatment of women throughout history was never ""It's boy's night every night"". Men didn't really just exclude women for the sake of excluding women. There were usually other reasons behind it. Men usually want women around, even if just for the company, and that wasn't really any different back then. 

>Also because the movie literally acknowledges that ‚Äúgirls night forever‚Äù is a problematic statement in the end as well‚Ä¶

One passing comment of ""well, maybe I was wrong, I guess I won't do it as often anymore"" isn't really addressing it. Acknowledging a problem is a bit different from addressing it. 

> because a man isn‚Äôt entitled to anything in a woman‚Äôs life without the woman‚Äôs consent even if they are dating. 

Why do you keep bringing this up? It's completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. It's like you're just repeating the same feminist catch phrases over and over hoping it will have some kind of meaning here. It doesn't. Nothing that I discussed relates to entitlement, and saying that men aren't entitled to women when no one implied as such is not arguing in good faith either. 

>the vast vast vast majority of rapers of men are men AND the vast majority of rapers of women are ‚Ä¶ spoiler alert men

You believe this because rape against men is hardly ever reported, and because when women rape men it is also hardly ever considered rape. It's very easy to argue that it's mostly just men that rape, when the data is only really recorded under that scenario on a cultural and systematic level. If would be like saying ""it's mostly black people who are violent"", in a culture that only records and recognizes violence when it's committed by black people, and then uses one-sided statistics it created to justify itself.  Most western countries still do not even use the word ""rape"" when a female teacher rapes an under-aged boy. 

Regardless, the point remains that the existence of rape is not a demonstration of systematic misogyny, especially when it is criminalized and universally despised.  I was also talking about violence, not just rape, and men are far more likely to be targeted for violent crime in general, and often in far more brutal ways.

And that is what is so dangerous with movies like this. It creates this really twisted, hateful and false revision of history, and then gullible women just buy into it and fall into it and use it as a way to justify their own prejudice and chauvinism against men. It's everything feminists accuse lonely men and incels of doing, only worse because women already are in such a position of power and privilege.

"That is very black and white thinking. I sense you're angry and you view this movie as just another drop in the bucket, without considering the nuances of character and story. All feminist media is not man-hating or misandry. Some may be, but you can't paint the whole thing with the same brush. If you see it that way, I think that's showing you something about yourself that you aren't interested in addressing.

In the Barbie movie, Ken reaches a healthy understanding of himself at the end. He goes to one extreme, then he realises he doesn't have to be an ass to everyone and he doesn't need Barbie's attention to be worthy as a man. How is that not favourable? He thought he had to be a sexist pig in order to find his power and worth, then he realised that it's all bullshit, and found his own way of being that isn't dependent on whether a woman looks at him or not. Is that not empowering? Or are you fixated on the fact that men aren't the ruling class in Barbie land and that fact alone means men don't matter in this movie... ?

The message is:

- Other people don't get to define your worth
- You are more than your appearance and wealth
- You don't have to dominate and subjugate others in order to be a valid person worthy of love and affection
- If one gender holds another down and denies them equal participation, *it's a bad thing* (THAT'S WHY IT'S SATIRE)
- Sexism harms all genders
- It's not black and white, one OR the other - that kind of thinking leads to problems (that was Barbie's whole character arc, and it was Ken's, too - black and white thinking got them both in trouble)

tbh I'm sensing a lot of anger about women in general, fixated on feminism as some kind of evil thing. Feminism, at its core, is about equality. Not only civil rights (legalities), but about both men and women viewing and treating each other with respect. We don't have equality when we're harbouring anger, hatred, and resentment towards the other sex in our hearts and minds.

Gender stereotypes don't help us move towards equality. They're harmful to everyone and keep us in boxes. Take the high suicide rate among men. Clearly there is a mental health crisis among men. The gender stereotypes of men being expected to be stoic and solitary, never crying or acknowledging (let alone expressing) a full range of emotion is literally killing men. Men shit all over each other and call each other gay or feminine for trying to form close friendships. Women often shit all over men who dare cry or express vulnerable emotions, saying they aren't being ""manly"". Clearly, that version of masculinity is harming - not helping - men. How can we be equal when we're reinforcing these harmful stereotypes and policing everyone's masculinity? YOU get to decide for YOURSELF what it means to be a worthy, respectable man, apart from all the hatred and vitriol and shame. Fuck what other people think.

And Ken went through that character arc in the movie. He refused to let people see him crying because he said it was weak, but he was miserable. He had no sense of self-worth because he based it all on whether women gave him attention. Once he realised that he is enough just by *being who he is*, he reached a resolution and found his own inner strength WITH HIS BEST BROS whom he no longer saw as enemies/competitors, but as friends. 

Ken learned about patriarchy in the real world and brought it back into Barbieland. It looked ridiculous and terrible because patriarchy is ridiculous and terrible, and satire is intended to point out the vices and moral failings of social systems like that. Matriarchy is ridiculous and terrible too. The point at the end of the movie is not that they're going to stay the same forever in Barbieland, but that both Barbie herself AND Barbieland are at a point of transformation, where they can find a new way forward that doesn't maintain the old status quo. The movie ends with the implication that THEY STILL HAVE WORK TO DO TO MOVE FORWARD because where both societies are now is not perfect.",2023-07-22
"The brand new BarbieMovie TM dolls that we are all supposed to buy are very stick thin.  Not realistic same as old barbie.

When I said ‚Äúappeal‚Äù I didn‚Äôt mean that men sharing feelings would turn women on as if I thought that was the feminist idea - I meant that it would appeal to women to share feelings and cry etc - so feminist women think that doing that should appeal to men as a thing men should also want to do (but mostly don‚Äôt). It‚Äôs got nothing to do with being attractive to women. 

My point was that what feminist women like Bell Hooks claim would be good for men is stuff that has always been normal to them as women and they think is good for them as women  - so they‚Äôve decided that the status quo for them (sharing more feelings, crying etc) is the right way to be for men, despite what men actually think or want, they think they know best.

It almost gives the movie a darker and Black Mirror-esque twist. Like these people you were rooting for the whole time end up being just as bad as the oppressors they fought against. Would have been kind of a cool moment for Sasha or even stereotypical Barbie to point this out and then have some kind of compromise between the Barbies and Kens.

"The parameters are contrived. That doesn't mean that competition in any and all its forms is artificial.

Part of human survival is competition, be it against nature, or each other. Sports are a diluted and filtered impression of that. Someone who is good at gymnastics may be better at climbing a tree to get fruit. Someone who is good and wrestling may be better at defending the tribe from wild animals or an invading tribe.

And if a manifestation of competition takes the form of some contrived game with made up parameters, it's predictable that those who enjoy the game will find those who are more adept at it more exciting to watch",2023-07-22
"""Sport is inherently a way for men to express superiority over one another and especially women.""  
You described competition, not patriarchy dummy. Women also compete among one another. It is a human thing to feel envy.  


And I see no men challenging women out to sports frequently, it usually used to be a girl power type of move to push a message, good or bad, when ""matches of gender"" would occur. Because unless man was extremely cocky and old, these matches almost always resulted in men winning due to the biological advantage. And when people found it out that biological truth, it stopped being pushed. Because it was going against the message that we are equal in all the ways.  


And no, competition is not artificial, it is literally hard coded into us as animals. Nature IS competition, which makes me question if you had any idea about anything you are talking about.  


A LOT of animal species compete for partners attention so they can reproduce, which is a literal biological goal so a species can thrive. Entire species compete for food, and then herds, packs of animals also compete for food and territory. Tribes of humans competed over resources and in fact still do. Long before we even created a concept of ""Patriarchy"". When you think about it, Evolution itself is pretty much competition, who is going to adapt better to fill in a niche in the foodchain first to manage to survive.   


In short. Please, read a biology book before you write anything on the internet about ""Patriarchy"".",2023-07-22

"There‚Äôs inherent violence because as long as you have laws and people who disobey those laws you‚Äôre going to need a way of enforcing the law - and that will always be violence. I mean that‚Äôs what the law is - when the police come and arrest you they overpower you physically and then you are imprisoned and if you try to escape you‚Äôre again overpowered physically. So that‚Äôs all violence. The law is violence and the threat of violence. It‚Äôs pretty simple.

There will never be a utopia where no one commits crime or isnt unhappy enough to try to go against accepted law, so you always need violence. And because men are bigger and stronger you‚Äôll always need their violence.

If your asking which would be more or less violent between a matriarchy or patriarchy I think it‚Äôs kind of a pointless question as because a matriarchy would require male violence in order to enforce its laws on men, it can‚Äôt really happen. Unless men collectively decide that women are better off in charge than they are, which lets be real they won‚Äôt, why would men in the long term, enforce matriarchal laws they didn‚Äôt agree with on themselves? So considering what a true matriarchy would be like for humans would just be a pointless fantasy which was actually totally impossible. If you ever got too many women in power making laws to the point of approaching a matriarchal system which the majority of men didn‚Äôt agree with enough for them to want to do something about it, there would just be an overthrow of the women‚Äôs power, because men have the violence that‚Äôs needed to enforce law and women don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs that simple. It‚Äôs neither good or bad but that‚Äôs the way things are and have to be. At least, I can‚Äôt see any other possibility.

"Yeah they get the funny parts because they‚Äôre made a joke of - which would be fine if that happened to Barbies as well In the same way.

I‚Äôm not harping on it for female empowerment - I‚Äôm harping on it for bashing men the entire time. Kens are the underclass in Barbie land and kind of an avatar for women but that‚Äôs not so bad, but then the real world patriarchy is super bad and the patriarchy of Kens is bad and gets overthrown. There‚Äôs mixed messaging in making the Kens represent both women and the real world patriarchy. If the Barbieland matriarchy was shown as bad in the same light as the Ken patriarchy and real world patriarchy the movie would make sense. But as it‚Äôs not it just seems to push the message that women are better and men are incompetent morons (literally every man in the movie is an idiot or an idiot villain, even the real world husband of America Derraras character). 

Again with mixed messaging - That the ending both seems to want to paint the Barbie matriarchy as the real world patriarchy (but worse) in that they promise to listen to Kens more but also makes them the hero‚Äôs of the story is weird.

"> every man and Ken in the movie is a moron and doing bad things

The Kens were never evil - just like the Barbies, they heard about something called 'patriarchy' (with only a surface level understanding brought back from the real world) and it acted like a virus, resulting in both Barbies and Kens acting like they *thought* they were *expected to act* 'in a patriarchy.' 

A major point in the movie is that men are also subjected to conflicting expectations that can wreck them too.

For example- Ken feeling like he was defined by things he owned, or by the partner he was with. Or Ken feeling like it wasn't okay to let out his emotions. Or feeling like he *had* to be a 'leader,' since he was a man - even if he didn't really want to lead. 

Or how it turned out the CEO was *genuinely* all about 'female empowerment over profits' despite all the earlier jokes implying ""an old rich guy caring about women? Yeah right."" Or the CEO wanting to hug people more - all positive examples of men breaking out of conflicting societal expectations placed on them.

Allow me to draw a comparison . In hobbit trilogy the dwarves are  dumb , unhygienic , aggressive  and have deep mistrust towards elves . The movie uses all of these traits beautifully for humor  . 

But at no point you feel like elves are superior than dwarves . Bcz when they both interact  their banter is balanced as both parties jab at each others faults and the director is not using it to show which race is superior . His motives are pure comedy and it results in quality humor . 

It's not about male vs female shit , I would have retched  similarly at the director's talent if the entirety of  female gender were portrayed this dumb and were mocked about things they enjoy .

"In BarbieLand, all of the Kens had no jobs, no purpose, and no value. They were worse than slaves; they were literally house pets whose only purpose was as an accessory for a Barbie.

The message that Ken is enough on his own was undercut by the demonization of virtually all male-centric activities and the portrayal of men throughout the movie as universally dumb, selfish, and crude.

The movie tells us that the matriarchy is an innocent mistake, but when Kens patriarchy takes over it's presented as an intentional and malicious thing where the women have to be literally brainwashed to go along with it.

Women and men would certainly notice that and it would make the guy seem like an asshole and no one would be defending it.

The whole thing of calling men who don‚Äôt agree with you emotionally fragile is so pass√© and transparent - it‚Äôs basically the progressive or feminist equivalent of calling a man a girly man or a weak man as an insult and is used as such. Except when your a feminist or progressive you can‚Äôt say that as it goes against your ideology in which men are supposed to be allowed to be weak or feminine - so you say fragile in a condescending way.

And that‚Äôs the attitude I see in Barbie as well. Which is very bigoted. You take all the ribbing you want and never advocate for yourself if that makes you feel strong and not fragile.

"My comment reads ""virtually no advertisement"". Yes, women have worked in advertisement too. But advertisement is mainly made by men and while that has been changing in the recent decades even you should be able to acknowledge that this industry was predominately run by men. So I am not ""100% wrong on that"". You are a bit stuck in semantics. If you'd say ""this footballer never scores a penalty"" that generally doesn't mean that they never ever scored a penalty goal, it means that they are generally a lot worse than their contemporaries in this discipline. It's just a function of language and I doubt you're unaware of it, come on?

>Maybe you could say the ad is making women hate themselves because of those body standards, but no men are not telling women to hate other women that is just not true.

Advertisement has probably not told anyone out right to hate other women. But it has told them that they're less desirable if they don't own this product, look like this unachievable standard, behave in this way and so on. And while you're right that this can cause self-hatred it is not far fetched to conclude that it also can pit people against each other. If you've ever taken a look at how women were portrayed in media for a long time you can also see another aspect of this. Open any tabloid or women's magazine of most eras and you will find quite harsh criticism of women for many of the characteristics advertisement is claiming need to be solved. As I said, this is a subtext to advertisement. But it seems like you're always arguing along very technical lines. So, yes, advertisement has probably not out right said to hate other women but given the messaging of advertisement I think the point I was making is supported.

You seem to be a bit stuck on the fact that men have also been subjected to unfair standards. You won't find me arguing against that. As a man I absolutely agree. Advertisement, media, etc. is selling absolutely unattainable standards of success, beauty, etc. for men too.

"The rest of the movie does a great job at pointing out the injustices of the patriarchy, so that‚Äôs already well established. At this point, the movie‚Äôs addressing what the characters learned from both the injustices of the real world patriarchy and the Barbie matriarchy, and how to better things going forward.

Having the Barbies decide to just reinstall the matriarchy while giving Kens a bit more agency which equates to what women had irl about 40 years ago, the movie‚Äôs lesson goes from ‚Äúpatriarchy bad‚Äù to ‚Äúpower corrupts‚Äù, which I‚Äôd say misses the feminist angle they were going for.

Men had power in real world, created an unfair patriarchy. Barbies had power in Barbieland, created an unfair matriarchy. Kens seized power in Barbieland, created an unfair patriarchy. Barbies learned the faults of both sides, regained power in Barbieland and ‚Ä¶ created an unfair matriarchy again.",2023-07-31

It directly parallels the real-world.

Or ""Kens don't have the right cooperative spirit to take leadership roles.""

You hit the nail on the head if someone thinks it is wrong that the Kens are still treated poorly, they should focus on what is happening in the real-world.",2023-08-22

"The point was that it's possible to grow and change. Even as victims of society. Because people do it all the time. And then gave examples. A complete thought. Not sure why it was so hard for you to follow. 

I don't think I escaped anything. I am saying your premise isn't true in the first place. 

If what you think is true, why are there so many ugly, poor, weak men in successful and happy lives with beautiful wonderful women? What are they doing that you aren't? Think about it. 

The fact that you can even say the phrase ""access to women"" non ironically is horrendous and monstrous all on its own my guy. Of course no women want anything to do with you. You view them as commodities and not fully formed people. If you desire ""access to women"" so badly, maybe figure out what they ACTUALLY want first instead of just inventing what you THINK they want and then getting mad about it. 

I'll give you a hint, you can start by removing ""access to women"" from your vocabulary. They don't like things like that. 

And I will say it again. If a woman ACTUALLY LIKES YOU, they will never care about any of the things that you think they do. They only latch onto the surface level things when there is nothing else deeper to connect to.

As a fun side note, we absolutely know Elon is lonely and unhappy because literally every single thing he does and says is due to that. 

Does a well adjusted happy person lie about someone trying to murder him and blame it on an airplane tracker when it turned out it literally had nothing to do with Elon at all and was just a creepy grimes stalker that he never actually helped her with even though he claims to love her?

Nobody is saying ""oh you and your children are starving? Just find self worth elsewhere!!!‚Äú and I feel like your suggestion that extreme poverty and living in homelessness is a counter example is insane, obviously the first steps are to do whatever you can to survive. Mental health can only come after physical safety and some level of security.

You can see feminists are upset that women are forced into domestic roles, and that's certainly true, but you seem to ignore that feminists are likewise upset that men are drafted into the military or forced to work dangerous jobs.

And you have a point perhaps.. as shown in the movie, barbieland is still just a relatively quick trip away from venice beach. I mean, it's not like the undying lands in LOTR where there's no turning back forever and ever. Virtually infinite pros for what cons?

"What I meant by womens ‚Äúoppression‚Äù not being as bad as racial oppression was in reference to what you were saying about women being ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù for hundreds of years. I‚Äôm not saying every culture today treats women right or tragic things don‚Äôt happen to women on account of their gender.

I‚Äôm saying that there‚Äôs a difference between some happy farmers wife or Landlady hundreds of years ago before women even showed the slightest inclination of wanting to step outside of traditional gender roles and someone who is enslaved because of their race or had their country invaded by a different race. One is truly opressed  - the other isn‚Äôt oppressed at all, she‚Äôs simply in a gender role as all people were at the time and they didn‚Äôt think anything else was even possible.

How can I think a woman in medieval times in Europe is oppressed when neither she, nor her husband, nor anyone else in the world has ever conceived of a world without standard gender roles? that world was really only practically possible after the Industrial Revolution which explains why no one considered it. Women living then weren‚Äôt all being oppressed just because they‚Äôre doing a gender role and more than male chimps are oppressing female chimps. They‚Äôre just both following animal instinct and that‚Äôs why they had different gender roles back then.

"I haven‚Äôt seen ladybird.

It seemed to be that she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to write a female character actually being instructed by a male character and appreciating it - even though he‚Äôs literally her teacher and she asked for his advice. 
I get why she changed the ending to have Jo not marry Bhauer, but throughout the movie she really makes his character much less than what it is in the book and for no apparent reason.

It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs obviously making a  bad point about men or anything if you‚Äôve only seen the movie of little women, but when you realise how the Jo and Bhauer relationship has been subtlety changed from the book to movie, it‚Äôs hard to see any motivation for the changes other than wanting to show that Jo didn‚Äôt need a man‚Äôs help.

For voting being restricted to landowners is oppression. Oppression is not defined by race or gender it is one group over another. Also getting land back then is not as easy as you make it out to be.

Yea demanding basic health care needs is still demanding something. Your bodily autonomy does not include being able to demand what you want from other people.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/155afzv/comment/jsucaml/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/155afzv/comment/jsucaml/)

You are correct that I am upset, but this in no way makes my comments less meaningful or on the spot.

The way you treated my response is precisely why I am upset. You are talking down to me precisely like the movie talked down to men. Especially:

&#x200B;

>Men shit all over each other and call each other gay or feminine for trying to form close friendships.

&#x200B;

which is sexist and not correct at all. 

And you think that I did not catch all of the intended messages? 

But that does not change the fact that Barbie was the one that transcended to the real world. Ken had a basic redemption and empowering arc, while Barbie was the one who straight up evolved into something else entirely. And this is enough to tell you what Greta thinks of men capabilities. 

But then we got all of the ""wonderful"" portrayals of men via the various Kens. Their weakness? Their pride and ego, of course - how original. You go to the real World - not a single man worth mentioning. Barbie is assaulted immediately after entering - how lovely. Was there a single man in the whole movie that had dignifying portrayal or women think the simple-minded Kens are the peak of what men can be? 

I especially liked how Barbies stuck together, while the downfall of Kens was that they were put against each other. Which brings me back to this shallow piece of insight:  


>Men shit all over each other and call each other gay or feminine for trying to form close friendships.

In my experience it was men that formed the strongest of bonds between each other. Me and my friends can say what we want to each other. We can be openly angry with each other, can share intimate moments and help each other with basically anything. Women in my life always had to be other people around their girlfriends / relatives / colleagues and if for some reason one of the gals stood out the others would isolate her from the group quickly. I have been witness to this so much in my personal and my work life. So much jealousy and so much gossiping. My wife works from home and I hear everything. Then she can not say where we have been to her friends, because they shunned her a lot in the past for even mentioning something foreign. But shitty people are not everyone, right!? 

Guess what? Everybody is shitty. And this is where we, men, excel - we do not pretend to be something which we are not - I can tell you that men are going to love the Kens and will connect with them, not giving a fuck about how we are portrayed in the movie. This thread is a proof - Ryan Gosling received so many praises. Watch reviews of the movie from men - it receives appraisal from everywhere. We are the ones, who are going to be open about new experiences, about harsher words of wisdom, about rejections, about living our own life without caring about what other people think when it does not matter. We are shitty and we accept other people to be shitty as well.

It is women who misunderstand us and try to change us to something we are not. If Ken remained oblivious to the patriarchy and still supported Barbie all throughout the movie, I would have been the happiest man, because this is what I know to be true. We no longer crave power, we do not want to metamorphose to something which we are not and we do not need the approval of someone that doubt herself every second. Give us the toy we like and we are going to be the most satisfied people in the World. It is women who will always want more from us and not the other way around. 

But if you are going to be talking about equality, about how graciously you portray us and how ""Barbie"" is for everybody, at least have the balls to walk the line and have us at the front row with you. Do not portray us as this misguided, co-dependent airheads that are going to be seduced by power the second they see it and women have to fix us.

I think many of the things they said went over my head, and only after thinking about the movie after seeing it i have discovered more underlying meanings. I also believe that what you get from the film depends on your life. My best friend doesn‚Äôt work (totally fine btw, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to lol), she never experienced being in a mostly male school or work environment and her direct family doesn‚Äôt seem to have any toxic males in it so I don‚Äôt think this movie would resonate the same for her.",2023-08-04

"As I said excusing writing the men as all morons as a metaphor or satire is just a lame excuse. If a man wrote all the women in a movie like that and then was like ‚Äúso what it‚Äôs a metaphor you just don‚Äôt get it‚Äù it wouldn‚Äôt fly and neither should this. I don‚Äôt not like the movie because I don‚Äôt get it - I understand the attempted symbolism but because of the overall portrayal of men in the movie that is lost under the man hating vibe of the whole thing.

No women didn‚Äôt used to be shown as silly housewives subservient to their partners - yes some female characters were housewives, but they could still be good or clever, they‚Äôre not all portrayed as morons at all. I wonder if you‚Äôve seen many old movies to think that was the way way were portrayed often.

It‚Äôs not about guys being pissed off  how the Kens are treated, I think most people with a brain understood they were a real world reverse of women (although they also represent patriarchy which is why there‚Äôs some mixed messages that conflict) - it‚Äôs about how all men including the real world men and Kens are portrayed. If Kens were treated bad but the Barbie land matriachy was portrayed more clearly villainous like the real world patriachy or Kendom you would have a point. But it‚Äôs not at all, it‚Äôs competent and smart and doesn‚Äôt explore faults of the women at all. In contrast the real world and Kendom is full of stupid incompetent men and is all about what‚Äôs wrong with men. If you make the movie that way then obviously it‚Äôs going to suggest that men are idiots and women do a better job running things. How could it not?
So the message getting out to a lot of guys isn‚Äôt empathise with women more, it‚Äôs, wow these feminists really don‚Äôt like men or anything about them.

Also hyper sexualising women isn‚Äôt the same thing at all. You may not like it but it‚Äôs not the same. The women‚Äôs equivalent of that is all those romance stories like Jane Austen or 50 shades with some broody rich guy or those teen girl stories with broody fantasy vampires or whatever. Those are just the different wank fantasies of men and women. It‚Äôs not comparable to portraying an entire gender as morons in the wrong. And I don‚Äôt know who Ben Shapiro is. Sure some guy somewhere might make jokes about women - but if that‚Äôs wrong then why is this right? And don‚Äôt tell me because it‚Äôs satirising that that a lame cope.",2023-07-26
"What Ken did, in the real world, would at best get him charged with breaking and entering, trespassing, maybe even Fraud. At worst, it would get him charged with insurrection. Because Barbie hurt his feelings, Ken would have, at the hands of the United States Federal Government, probably spent the rest of his life in jail. Meanwhile, Gerwig presents a different reality where this man is basically told to do some soul searching and find a therapist.

If Ken behaved in a way that aligned with what hooks taught, there would have been no conflict, no movie. Ken would have said ""the fuck is this shit? I want someone who appreciates me"" and he would have left. He would have displayed emotional maturity.

Sure, some might see hooks and Gerwig as arrogant. If I were in Kens shoes, however, I would definitely prefer the treatment hooks and Gerwig envision as opposed to the way we'd be treated in our society.",2023-07-26

"The depiction of the Barbie matriarchy is far more positive than the Kendom or real world patriarchy - you can‚Äôt seriously deny that. I never said the Kens were evil - I said they and the men were all shown as morons doing something wrong.

Yes, I get that the movie tries to portray the feminist talking point that men are hurt by patriarchy because they actually secretly want to cry and find themselves and don‚Äôt really like the things they seem to like - but it‚Äôs just that, a feminist talking point - 95% of men don‚Äôt feel that way at all.

The reality is that the real world women battling patriarchy are shown as heroic and the barbies battling Kendom are the ones we‚Äôre supposed to be rooting for - whereas Ken is shown negatively even when pushing back on matriarchy as embodying ‚Äútoxic‚Äù qualities. 

The movie doesn‚Äôt explore anything fundementally wrong with the Barbie matriarchy unique to women other than Kens having no place - apart from that the barbies are all wonderful and competent - but when the Kens take over they‚Äôre toxic and bad etc. The Kens interests are mocked whereas the Barbies dance parties and whatever are shown positively.

Actually I think the Barbie matriarchy ending is actually the embodiment of a lot of feminist talking points - women should have more power and make great leaders and when patriarchy is overthrown men will be able to cry and won‚Äôt have to lead and that somehow means equality. Meanwhile the majority of men don‚Äôt want to do any of the things feminism claims patriarchy is holding them back from doing.

"Misandric?

Do you know ANYTHING about bell hooks? she was a voice within feminism pushing back against the anti-men sentiment that does exist. Her take on the subject matter comes from a place of love for men.

""To create loving men, we must love males. Loving maleness is different from praising and rewarding males for living up to sexist-defined notions of male identity. Caring about men because of what they do for us is not the same as loving males for simply being. When we love maleness, we extend our love whether males are performing or not. Performance is different from simply being. In patriarchal culture males are not allowed simply to be who they are and to glory in their unique identity. Their value is always determined by what they do. In an anti-patriarchal culture males do not have to prove their value and worth. They know from birth that simply being gives them value, the right to be cherished and loved.""",2023-07-24

"I think the draft should be canceled for everybody, along with genital mutilation regardless of gender. Yay, we agree! /s

There are other factors in the wage gap issue that you missed. Women are more likely to have gaps in their resume due to raising a child or taking care of a family member, and our current society penalizes resume gaps regardless of cause. Women also face barriers getting an education, it's actually easier for a guy to get into college than a woman with the same test scores (despite women making up ~60% of college students.) Also a strict job-to-job comparison breaks down in highly gendered industries like nursing and teaching. ""Pink collar"" jobs have lower starting/median wages across the board compared to male-dominated industries, even though wages within those categories appear equal.

"Ruth Handler said: ‚ÄúMy whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be.

She wanted to show them that women could make choices, including the choice not to marry and have kids. 

I‚Äôll admit, keeping Barbie single probably kept it more interesting - watching a movie with a ‚Äúwill-they-won‚Äôt-they‚Äù plot is certainly more interesting than watching a movie where the characters are happily married. I agree that keeping Barbie unmarried probably sold more dolls - though, like you said, the common perception is that Ken and Barbie have always been together.

But it is simply incorrect to assert ‚Äúpeople think that Barbie and Ken are gf and bf and therefore the movie should have depicted them as such‚Äù. The movie used the Barbie lore correctly. Not knowing the lore is not a valid argument for why Ken and Barbie should have gotten together.

"Yeah totally they do. But they also suffer from other issues that intertwine and affect and worsen them. That's what intersectionality is, and an explicitly feminist film in 2023 that isn't intersectional and only pays lip service to diversity through casting isn't one that's doing anything particularly good.

Like, the struggles I have as a guy are inextricably intertwined with being trans. I can't talk about one without also talking about the other, unless I'm talking shallowly.

And it's fine to talk about things shallowly! But the film is coming from a place where it's clear they aren't (purely) aiming for fun shallowness, and if you're trying to make a work of art that says something about politics, there are added responsibilities and nuances.

"You do realize that there is a direct conflict *in* the Barbie movie, right? And it isn't what you're saying. I think you're honestly focusing way too hard on the fact that you're being ""represented"" in a bad light (in the focus of the men that are displayed in the movie). The whole point is for it to be like that. 

Barbie movies typically follow a formula where Barbie is the protagonist and usually embodies positive qualities such as kindness, friendship, and determination. These movies often revolve around themes of adventure, self-discovery, and overcoming challenges. The reason why you don't see Barbie being portrayed as the bad guy is because she's the main character. There are plenty of times that Barbie has her ups and downs (let that be mood swings or just general plot) but at the end of the day, I don't really think that Ken was seen really in that bad of a light either. His character was meant to be exaggerated as ""stereotypical"" (I know, a horrible world) as was Barbie to be ""generic"". 

&#x200B;

>*""The movie tells us that the matriarchy is an innocent mistake, but when Kens patriarchy takes over it's presented as an intentional and malicious thing where the women have to be literally brainwashed to go along with it.""*

The movie is using extreme examples of matriarchy and patriarchy to illustrate how unchecked power, regardless of the gender it is associated with, can lead to negative consequences. The innocent mistake in the matriarchy is highlighting that even well-intentioned decisions made without proper consideration can have unintended outcomes. The malicious nature of Ken's patriarchy emphasizes the dangers of power being concentrated in the hands of a few and how it can be exploited for control. Anyone can have this, I don't really think it was subject to just Ken. Barbie and Ken might learn valuable lessons from their experiences in both worlds, which contributed to their personal development and understanding of the complexities of power and society. TLDR: It's showing extreme power imbalances, and instead of looking at the movie and going ""Wow, only Ken is seen as the bad guy"", go ""Wow, I see a lot of people struggle through this daily"" (LGBTQA+, Rights Activist Movements, Feminism, Politics, etc). 

&#x200B;

>*""Again, this isn't what the movie does. It does this for only 15 minutes, then it goes to a hyper-patriarchal real world and then back to a hyper-patriarchal Kenworld. They do not stick to the premise you claim they do.""*

The initial shift from Barbie Land to the real world and then to the hyper-patriarchal Kenworld is a deliberate narrative choice to create contrast and emphasize the extremes of different societal systems. This narrative arc is used to underscore the importance of finding balance and collaboration between genders, highlighting the negative consequences of unchecked power regardless of whether it's a matriarchy or patriarchy.  By showcasing hyper-patriarchal systems, the movie is critiquing the excesses of traditional gender roles and power dynamics, encouraging viewers to question the validity of such extreme viewpoints. TLDR: The movie uses these different worlds to explore how gender roles and power dynamics affect characters and societies. It doesn't only focus on saying one system is better than the other, but it critiques extreme beliefs and shows how characters learn and grow through these experiences.

Hope this helped you understand a bit (hopefully). Sorry it's a bit lengthy, but going into more depth might help you consider another side. Also, I want to mention that you're free to have your own opinion, wasn't trying to change it at all. ‚ô°",2023-08-06
The point is that Barbieland learns that the matriarchy is flawed and looks to the real world to fix it- they will slowly give the Kens more voice and power over time. Its not saying one is better than the other,2023-08-06
"It did show that men have troubles. This was shown through Ken the most. He obviously had his own arc, but we also saw him trying to get a job and not being able to because he didn‚Äôt meet the basic requirements. Allan and Aaron also had some struggles. It also didn‚Äôt show them as one dimensional or evil like you originally stated. Dumb, yeah I‚Äôll give you that one. I‚Äôm assuming by evil you‚Äôre referring to their takeover of Barbieland? If so, That‚Äôs just how a lot of men actually act, so it‚Äôs more realistic than evil. 

Honestly, your point about male suicide is irrelevant to this discussion. I don‚Äôt think the point of the movie was to say men have no struggles. The point was to shed light on the struggles women face that are specifically caused by men. You‚Äôre invalidating that by making it about issues men face, but those issues, while important, are not caused by women. I‚Äôd say male suicide is a problem caused my misogyny and patriarchy because men don‚Äôt seek out help for mental health as often as women due to toxic masculinity and the expectations people have of the male gender as a whole. And while I know that women do perpetuate those ideas sometimes, they were put into place by men. 

Now answer my question. Why is your response to a film about women‚Äôs struggles that men have struggles too? Why do you have to make it about yourself?

"Oh it was 100% meant as an insult, I wouldn‚Äôt further insult you by pretending otherwise. I would generally consider myself a progressive (maybe not a feminist, but only because I am not an activist, not because I don‚Äôt agree with the idea that women should be equal in society). It is absolutely not contradicting my personal ideals to laugh at somebody who found the Barbie movie to be ‚Äúbigoted‚Äù against men. 

I don‚Äôt see any inherent contradictions in being a ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù male. I just think your take specifically is silly and absurd, and built largely on an insecurity about the place of male identity in our culture now that I simply do not understand. 

Of course men should be able and encouraged to express their emotions, even those that are in opposition to the standard ideals of masculinity. That doesn‚Äôt mean though that somebody will be exempt from being goaded by a guy like me because they‚Äôve been triggered by a few jokes at the expense of a nerdy dad character (which is a complete trope, not even an invention of this movie).

For men to co-opt the language of the oppressed because there were no Stallone (very glad he and Arnie were your examples, I love them) type men in a movie is, in my opinion, laughable. This movie was not man-hating, it was just about, and largely for, women. 

You use the word feminism like it‚Äôs a bad thing. This is something I also do not understand. 

You are right, however, that I cannot immediately think of specific movies where male ‚Äúheroes‚Äù casually make dismissive remarks about women, or mention women outside of their relationships in a favorable manner.

"I brought up Oppenheimer because I believe the two movies to be related in theme and both culturally relevant today.

but also I think we differ in opinion because you mentioned that matriarchy was painted in a good light. I don't think matriarchy was shown at all in the film, based on Hellen Mirren's narration in the opening sequence.

I have a heart, thanks. I‚Äôm quite the opposite of a misogynist. I‚Äôm also a lesbian, so men don‚Äôt even play much of a role in my life. Aside from the oppressing women thing unfortunately. I truly couldn‚Äôt care less about them generally. 

I don‚Äôt think Barbie is a comment specifically on Hollywood. It‚Äôs more of a critique of society as a whole.  But yeah, I agree that Hollywood sexualizes actresses and uses them to get money from male audiences. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs okay. 

I didn‚Äôt even view Barbie as some joyful, happy movie. It genuinely upset and frustrated me because of how women are viewed and treated in society. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, and obviously being sexualized all of the time is going to impact someone negatively in terms of mental health. 

Some of what you‚Äôre saying is valid and correct. I just don‚Äôt agree with all of it, and I think it‚Äôs absurd to compare the movie to rape. That‚Äôs just in bad taste. The movie is supposed to reflect society and show the issues women face because of patriarchy, so I mean, yeah of course she‚Äôs going to be treated poorly at times and sexualized. That‚Äôs what women go through irl. Dehumanization is another issue, so it makes sense for her to be dehumanized in the film (also because she isn‚Äôt human until the end). I think overall you‚Äôre missing the point of the film and the intention behind it. 

The reason Barbie is portrayed the way she is is because she‚Äôs a toy and also a woman. Those two things together explain why she feels the way she feels throughout the movie.",2023-07-23
"I already responded to your previous reply, but just to reiterate, I don‚Äôt need Barbie to be some happy joyful toy. I just think you didn‚Äôt understand the film.

There are absolutely issues within the LGBTQ+ community and people who consider themselves ""gayer"" than others and gatekeep that community. I've no doubt people do get involved with the LGBTQ+ community for the wrong reasons and attempt to wield power over others.

What I was saying was that as a straight and cis man, I have never felt any pressure to identify as anything I am not. I would feel a lot more uncomfortable going out as someone who looked like a transwoman, than dressing as I do currently. I would also feel more uncomfortable walking around holding hands with a man than walking around holding hands with my girlfriend (for fear of comments at the minimum). I also have seen first hand that certain friends, my girlfriend and non-white friends mainly, are treated differently than I am because of who they are.

One random experience that really stuck with me was when I was on a night out in a club and someone stood behind me in the queue for the bar gestured to a pair of men and referred to them as a ""pair of f*ggots"" without a hint of shame. This man was extremely comfortable proudly displaying his homophobia.

You're basically saying that the Barbies, within the span of about 48 hours, should have learned about the concepts patriarchy and oppression, fully understood how to address it, and implemented changes to solve it...while humankind hasn't managed to do that yet after multiple millennia.

Beyond that, it would have missed the opportunity to provoke thought in the viewer.  The point of Barbie's story wasn't Barbie or Ken.  It was an analogue for our world's societal problems.  Allowing the viewer to walk way upset that the Ken's still aren't equal provides a great opportunity for the viewer to recognize how much work is still needed in our world.  If you're upset at Ken's treatment, you should be fucking furious at how actual human beings are treated every day.  That's a far more valuable lesson and opportunity for self-reflection and growth.

You are literally the one that used that vocabulary first. I'm just using your vocabulary. I've never had a conversation on reddit where someone wanted so bad to caricature my positions and put me in the ""bad guy box"".

I'm not advocating for defining your worth through having ""access to women"" ffs. I'm just saying that yes having a sexual history or having success with women is something important for the self worth of the vast majority of men for societal reasons enforced through many ways (from role models to commercials). Also for more biological reasons such as the need for intimacy but that's another topic. Thus it's very, very narrow-minded and unhelpful to present the situation as ""your self worth shouldn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt decided by your access to women"".

>The point was that it's possible to grow and change. Even as victims of society. Because people do it all the time.

Yes it is possible but it is a lengthy/costly (cognitively and/or financially) process not accessible to many. People don't do it all the time otherwise we will be living in paradise by now. And I even contend the fact that they do it on the basis of their free will or independently of specific social contexts (e.g., meeting a very good therapist, having certain predisposing personality traits).

"Not off the top of my head but I‚Äôd be surprised if there was one, I fail to see how that‚Äôs relevant to this movie though. 

The movie has flaws, which I alluded to earlier but I think if you want to have a discussion about it, you should probably finish the movie. There is certainly a large chunk of the movie where the Ken‚Äôs are full blown misogynists but it‚Äôs a cartoonish representation of it, which is brought about by their misunderstanding of how the real world works in comparison to Barbie land. 

For example main Ken thinks horses have a much larger role in the patriarchy then they actually do. It‚Äôs played for laughs but I think is a hint that they‚Äôve completely misunderstood the real world. 

I think people are taking the movie either too seriously or too literally or both. For me, a (mostly) straight, white man, who is also fed up of the woke garbage Hollywood has been putting out the last 5-10 years, it was refreshing to see a movie with a lot of those woke talking points be undercut by the outlandish exaggerated world the movie takes place in. 

For me it came across as satire of it all and a general message of men and women should all be pulling the same rope together because when we don‚Äôt it‚Äôs bad. Mix in some genuinely funny moments, good dance numbers, catchy songs, and overall an entertaining movie, this is why I‚Äôm surprised to see so much backlash. But perhaps I‚Äôm giving it too much grace, maybe others are being too harsh or somewhere in between. All that to say, I liked it lol.",2024-01-08

You know it's true, just like I admitted that what you said is true. Look bro it's not like i've done nothing in my life. But for some people it's just over. You know there is some truth to incel and right wing ideas. it's just super painful to admit it. There have been plenty experiments and studies that prove some of the things I've said. I just don't like how in reddit and leftists realities everybody has problems, but the whiter and more man you become the less your problems become valid. If you are truly a loser and you see everybody progressing in life except you, you feel bitter at the fact that nobody seems to recognize your issues except Andrew Tate and his ilk. I absolutely hate redpill, Andrew Tate. But it doesn't change the fact I never got to experience teenage love or any love from a girl whatsoever. By the time I actually got a chance to fuck a girl I didn't go through with it because I hated myself so much I knew I would never be able to get hard or enjoy myself, making me an even bigger loser.   


The point is in the west men are being spiritually neglected and right now and femininity is praised everywhere. For the healthy men like you who are already men it's all fine, you take part in it and don't lose anything from it. For the men who are struggling to stay afloat already, who are extremely insecure in their attractiveness and masculinity, it feels like a kick on the head causing me to drown further, pushing me right in the hands of Andrew Tate.

I don‚Äôt really think the message of the movie was about finding equality. The way I saw it i was about there being more to being a woman than dressing in pink and dancing as well as being more to being a man than hypermasculine traits and finding validity through women.

"That ending scene where Barbieland is restored, but Kens' gain a slightly better position wasn't meant to say that it's right to purposefully deny Kens full equality as a revenge or compensation for women being denied full equality in the real world. The point was to showcase that the things move in the right direction for Kens, compared to how Barbieland was at the beginning of the movie, while making a satirical commentary about how that actually plays out in (our) real world - the advantaged class cedes just a tiny piece of power and acts as if the disadvantaged should be thankful for their generosity, but isn't willing to share the power completely, and so achieving genuine equally takes a very long time, one small step at a time.

TLDR the scene isn't endorsing what happened, it's a satire of how progress looked and looks in real life",2023-07-24
"Ok, I was originally gonna ignore this specific part of the thread but your comment here convinced me otherwise. There‚Äôs a few things I noticed about what you said which I feel like not a lot of people are responding to. I have a few retorts, even if you might not listen, and I‚Äôm not doing them to hurt you‚Ä¶ kinda the opposite. While I‚Äôll admit that I don‚Äôt like the way you see certain things, it‚Äôs obvious that you‚Äôre fucking unhappy and I don‚Äôt think anyone deserves to be in the emotional space you‚Äôre in.

Thing 1:
> My point is that mosts leftists simply cannot fathom the idea that women have a special responsibility when it comes to regulating the dating market. I am saying that if women decide to be more promsicuous, they usually do so with a small percentage of men, leaving a lot of men out of the question. Men can't decide to be more promiscuous out of their own volition, it's always by the grace of women. It's simply a fact that women have a largely skewed amount of control over the dating market. This sounds very incelly and right wingy but it's simply the truth of survival and economic behaviour of women in the dating market. 

Most people will go after you because of how you‚Äôre talking about women here, but I want to point out something something else that might help a bit. You‚Äôre talking about the dating *market*, how women *regulate* and *control* it. You also in another comment talk about how women only *go for* the ‚Äútop men‚Äù.

While it‚Äôs low-hanging fruit to criticize how you‚Äôre portrating women, you‚Äôre also framing men as an economic good, and romantic love as a currency. If the majority of men don‚Äôt find a partner, they‚Äôre the equivalent of a faulty product. They were discarded over the new, superior model. Maybe try to consider that you‚Äôre objectifying *men*, including yourself‚Ä¶. which you shouldn‚Äôt do. People, be it men or women, aren‚Äôt products or buyers - you are more than an object to be purchased. You‚Äôre holding yourself to an unrealistic standard that only a fraction of men are gonna meet, even though the amount of men who actually end up with romantic partners is way, way bigger than that. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that you‚Äôre holding a worldview where you‚Äôre permanently a failure; if you can shed this worldview, try. If you can‚Äôt, try to learn how. Even if it‚Äôs just to understand how it feels like to not hold said worldview for, like, half an hour. It feels like an easy guess to me that, the moment you stop seeing your romantic prospects as comparable to the competition between Coca-cola and Pepsi, you will start having the confidence necessary not only to have a partner, but to live a fulfilling life as a person.

Thing 2:
> This sounds very incelly and right wingy but it's simply the truth of survival and economic behaviour of women in the dating market. I know it's not all women, but I get to talk about it monolithically in this context because it's still a large amount of women who control the dating market in western countries. It seems like leftists just can't phathom the idea that some conservative values actually are good for society and were not just in place to only be a tool of opression.

Speaking from my own experience, if we‚Äôre gonna divide this situation into two political sides, the women to have a strict standard over ‚Äúthe 20 percent of men‚Äù you speak of tend to be conservative. They‚Äôre the ones who tend to want a physically strong man who can provide for them, and is strong enough to protect them. This is a standard that, in our day and age and for our generation is‚Ä¶ not very achievable.

Most of my female friends are left-leaning and tend to have pretty average standards for men. Not supermodels, not ugly, not rich, not poor, not weird, not ordinary or boring, not mediocre. Not masculine or unmanly either, they generally just want to date a good person. They don‚Äôt want a perfect specimen, they want someone who is right for them.

I feel like dividing women‚Äôs taste in men into a political spectrum is a bit weird, but I‚Äôm kinda trying to say that you maybe need to expand your circles if the only women in your life have strict standards (easier said than done). Dating apps don‚Äôt count, those are brutal.

Thing 3, which was the tipping point to make me comment:

> Yeah, it's absolutely horrible to go without love for 24 years. On one side i pity myself for not having gotten the love that everyone deserves. On the other side i hate myself for being such a loser. I have already decided that I will not reach the age of 25.

I just turned 25 recently, have also never been in a serious relationship and have therefore struggled with feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. The big difference is that I‚Äôve been lucky enough to not fall into a place as dark as it looks like you‚Äôre in, so I‚Äôm aware that after a certain point I can‚Äôt help you from a place of experience. A quick thing I wanna mention is that barely now am I starting to form a more romantic bond with someone; I‚Äôm not saying this to rub anything in, but to tell you that sometimes it just takes ‚Äúthat long‚Äù (and to be honest, neither of us is old to begin with, even if I sometimes feel ancient already). Romantic love is inconvenient; a lot of us want it to fall on out laps even though that‚Äôs not how it works, and then when we‚Äôre not looking for it, it falls in our laps. Other times it does take some searching and some work. I also need to point out that the relationship I‚Äôm in now started at a point in my life where I had already examined what I really wanted besides needing to have a partner; I have long-located my passions and things that bring fulfillment to my life so I don‚Äôt have to depend on someone else.

I know a lot of what I just wrote probably sounds like ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre depressed? Have you tried being happy?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lonely? Just try having friends.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you tried being *god* yet???‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know what to say to that. I never was an incel, but I once did have incel-adjacent feelings about where my life was heading, I maybe still do. What I try to do is be self-critical about the way I feel about people, change when I realize I‚Äôm seeing something in a way can hurt others, and try to forgive myself for not being perfect.

You said you were raised to be loving but not strong, but it‚Äôs never too late to be strong. But also be strong for the right reasons. Be loving and strong because that‚Äôs a path to having a complete, fulfilling life, and because it‚Äôs part of what it means to be a good person. Being loving and strong so a woman will find you attractive won‚Äôt give you the happiness you seek, but that happiness does exist for you.

Edit: But something I need to put my foot down on is that I agree with people‚Äôs criticisms. Your talk of a ‚Äúdating market‚Äù is provably untrue, and is unfair towards women and men in different ways. While you at least *think* you care about women and probably want to, you still hold prejudices that you haven‚Äôt examined. On top of that last sentence, you‚Äôre basically betting your purpose in life on women - which isn‚Äôt fair on them, and isn‚Äôt going to have the outcomes you want. I commented because I genuinely believe the peace you‚Äôre looking for is out there, but beyond the obvious criticisms it needs to be pointed out that you hold (and have been made to hold) a perspective which is making it hard for yourself to find that happiness.",2023-07-21

Also, if they're just dolls, completely void of complexity, individual thought, empathy, etc. why do we even care about their world and what happens to them, and whether the Kens take over or not? They have just as much meaning being brainwashed as they do not being brainwashed - because they're dolls. 


If the depth of their abilities is what children do and how they work through things, even children understand the concept of sharing, being nice, and being empathetic (to a lesser degree, but they're not completely devoid of it as you say these dolls are).


And overall, I'm just saying that the movie literally has scenes of Barbies showing empathy when they deem it necessary. As stated above, they do empathize with each other - like with Weird Barbie. They understand that they were wrong and they try to make up for their mistake. This shows that they are learning empathy and understanding, after years of not treating Weird Barbie right.

If you want to take it even deeper - in 2004, Barbie dumped Ken and started dating Blaine. For two whole years, there were no new Ken dolls produced. It was Barbie and Blaine. And then they broke up, and she and Ken got back together. Maybe there will be a sequel thar explores this? Maybe not.

They‚Äôre just both following animal instinct and that‚Äôs why they had different gender roles back then.

You are just wrong. You don't even understand what you're talking about. Traditional gender roles are oppressive to women. You realize that, right? You realize that gender roles are constructed by society to dictate how people live their lives and aren't actually based in biology? 

You just compared women to animals and discounted what it was like to be sold off to be married to another family.

I see what you're saying, but I disagree. Why would a more equal response to the Ken's request for a position trivialise women's issues? If anything, the Barbie response undermines the idea of equality. If the Barbie's had given the position it would have shown that it is possible to make these changes and that they should be made, which would have highlighted more how that's not being done in our world.

The real doctors who seeks to provide safe services are persecuted, wasting valuable skilled individuals, not to mention the resources employed to prosecute them. Children of unwanted pregnancy are more likely to lead lives of poverty and crime. Women who face unwanted pregnancy must often choose between productive careers, or lives of dependency on their family and the state. Women who are forced to give birth are more vulnerable to abuse by spouses they are dependent on for survival. There are many women who require abortions for no other reason than to save their health or their lives. Finally, young girls need abortions when they are raped by predators, so that they can avoid the continuing harm of their rape, by being forced to care for a child while they themselves are still developing.

The beach scene where the Barbies pull out their cellphones to text in front of the Kens or switch to other Kens was also something that women sometimes do to toy with guys interested in them. I think a lot of women consciously have done that and guys are almost always oblivious to being gamed in that way.

All of that stuff is funny and cute when you are in a relationship or have been in many and see the parallels.

"Oh I see. Men invented the primordial concept of competition, because of the big bad patriarchy?

When there's a famine and there's not enough food to go around, is securing that food for your tribe not a form of competition? When hunters are fighting to bring down game to feed the tribe, are they not engaged in a competition with the animal? When 2 coffee shops are across the street from each other, each advertising for your business, are they not competing with one another? When there's a cute person of interest at an event and you get extra dressed up to catch their attention, are you not competing with other potential mates around you?

Are you at all versed in anthropology? Sure, sports specifically are not integral to the survival of humans, but competition as a concept isn't some artificial abstract notion.

It comes down to questioning the premise which I buy into. I don't watch sports myself, and I concur that they are not super important, but since these sports and audiences for them DO exist, let's switch over to a game theory approach: if we model a system that has those rules and parameters, and people are invested in them, then the people who are able to excel will be more entertaining to watch (or noteworthy to study).",2023-07-22

Feminism posits that is the result of the patriarchy conditioning women to compete with each other in the male dominated world. I have serious critiques of that philosophy, primarily because it assumes women have essentially no agency at all, but my issues with the philosophy are not the point - the movie doesn't engage with any of this.

This comment was paired with Barbie saying she felt anxious and an undercurrent of violence.

Both of these comments are social commentary on real life. Barbies comment is about how women often feel with the male gaze. Ken's comment was how third wave feminists think men feel on the day to day.

Both of these lines were written by women with a modern feminist political ideology, which is exactly why Barbies line is so accurate and spot-on to women's lived experience, whereas Ken's line is not accurate and does not accurately reflect men's lived experience, because the writer's are women who have no idea what it's like to be a man.",2023-07-23

"That's a pretty weak argument in defense of someone who ""loves men"". Even in the one paragraph you carefully chose to cherry pick, I see no love for men at all. There is nothing loving in misrepresenting men or how society affects/treats men. There is nothing loving about misattributing men's issues to patriarchy or other men, especially when it involves a great deal of gas-lighting or silencing men in the process. There is nothing loving in telling men that if women were just given more power, just because they are women and not because they are qualified, that men would suddenly find all their problems going away. There is nothing loving in dismissing the countless ways in which women are complicit in the many issues men face today, or the countless ways in which women benefit over men in any given social structure. 

 Nothing about this is ""pro-men"" or even ""pro-equality"". This is just more of the same hateful rhetoric, and it still doesn't make any kind of argument in your favor. One feminist extremist being slightly less extreme than other feminist extremists isn't even close to a fair or grounded approach to the problem.

"Barbie wanted to become a real life person because she saw the real world and didn't want to stay in Barbie-land anymore. But that's not growth. That's like the growth the D-level side character makes. It's just two actions. ""Go to Human World"" ""Come back from Human World"". We never SEE what should make this change. We never get any depth on this. I know this happened, I watched the movie. What I'm saying is this isn't ""growth"" for the character. Not in a way that your main character undergoes growth. This is like the bartenderer in the background of a sitcom eventually buying the bar from the owner in the finale. You feel great for them, but you didn't ""see"" any of their background on making this decision. Is that growth? Barbie's decision here is identical.

If Barbie had spent more time in the real world, if she had spent more time talking to her real-life owner, if she had learned how humans live and not just been explained it in a scene or seen it while sitting in the park for a couple minutes, if she had come to understand the mother/daughter dynamic and wanted that for herself, if she had interacted with more than three humans - you could argue this was growth. This was a decision she made based on experiences we see.

Data, in Star Trek, wants to be a human. In Data episodes, Data goes to great lengths to explain why he wants to be a human. We see him learn how to be human, and we see him learn incorrectly how to be human. We see him mimicking actors instead of finding that emotion from within, and it being explained to him that mimicking isn't going to make him more human. We see him grow as he learns to find whatever it is inside him that lets him perform not as a mimicer but as Data. THAT is growth. Barbie doesn't have that. This movie doesn't do that. Going to a gynecologist isn't growth. I think the gynecologist joke would have worked great with a setup as well. If you spend time in the human world, Barbie could go to the gynecologist with her human owner, be freaked out by it (since she doesn't have and doesn't understand genetalia). And it would make that decision at the end, as a human, to go to the gynecologist, both a follow-up joke but also some depth. She's literally overcoming a Doll fear, showing her growth and showing her humanity.

The movie simply did not do this. You can keep saying ""Barbie grew in this three minute dialogue"" - but that's not growth.",2023-08-06

Ken is not portrayed as a positive role model. Throughout the movie, he's depicted as helpless, impressionable, naive, stupid, emotionally immature, and in the end, his big achievement is realizing how pathetic and awful he is. But do we see him get better? Do we see him turn into a self-actualized man who manifests a positive male role model? Lmao no, not at all. 

>Or are you gonna say that Gloria‚Äôs husband learning Spanish was also a stab at men being stupid?

Sasha literally accused him of cultural appropriation when he did that. His behavior was explicitly and immediately castigated in the film and here you are saying he was portrayed as an example of a positive male role model. It's like you didn't even watch the same movie. 

This guy got about five seconds of screen time. He wasn't even named. He's not a role model. He's not even a character, barely more than an extra with a single speaking line. There's no male role models in the film.

That‚Äôs never been the sustained business model of comic books or the resulting movies either.

>The male villian in ant man is dispatched while Ghost, who is arguably more evil, is forgiven because...well...she's a girl? 

There‚Äôs a bit to unpack here. 

1. Cross was brought back, so the intent clearly wasn‚Äôt to have his story close there

2. You‚Äôre confused why an adult in a position acting out of malice would be treated more harshly than a teen (or young adult) who can‚Äôt control phasing into different realms or whatever? The whole point of the second half of that movie is helping her out so she stops the bad shit.

>The black widow movie which portrayed the only real male hero character, the crimson dynamo as a complete oaf and moron, did NOT do well at the box office.

It was the 4th highest box office in 2021 and did better than Bond (which still definitely has Bond girls, they just rebranded & and is as male fantasy focused as Barbie is female focused) so probably not a great example.

>My favorite story out of this is that ""Birds of Prey"" meant to be a feminist superhero story that ALSO put down men, brought out huge criticisms because of its poor box office performance.

"> What I was saying was that as a straight and cis man, I have never felt any pressure to identify as anything I am not.  I would feel a lot more uncomfortable going out as someone who looked like a transwoman, than dressing as I do currently.

Not everyone is you.  Think of it this way.  LGBTQ people are born LGBTQ right?  We can agree on that as that is the prevailing theory of the current time.

We can also agree that LGBTQ people growing up surrounded by straight people often feel pressured to be and act straight.

&nbsp;

So what happen if you grow up in an environment as a straight person where you're actually in the minority most times and LGBTQ people are celebrated and compliemnted just for being who they are and there are low key disses to straight and cis people and you often get othered or excluded for being cis/straight?

Answer:  It's the same kind of pressure as the LGBTQ felt.  I don't have to guess, I know.  Not only do I live in a very progressive city, but before I moved here I have been a furry for many years and furries are 2/3rds LGBTQ and have been since....well, furever.  Since their inception really.

&nbsp;

> I would also feel more uncomfortable walking around holding hands with a man than walking around holding hands with my girlfriend (for fear of comments at the minimum).

Alot of this feeling was instilled in your growing up.  Times have radically changed.  We've gone from judging people for even liking a show like the Powerpuff Girls or my Little Pony to 20% to that kinda stuff just more or less being accepted.  5% of people identified as LGBTQ before, 20% of Gen Z does.  Jocks and hard labor workers used to be the average working person who determined the status quo and brought home the bacon.  Now its nerdy people in tech jobs and people talk about STEM STEM STEM.

This is not the age your grew up in.  And I get it, I grew up in that, I once got fucked with for eating a salad because apparently that was gay.  Stupidest thing I've ever heard till this day.  But its day and night different from that today.

&nbsp;

> One random experience that really stuck with me was when I was on a night out in a club and someone stood behind me in the queue for the bar gestured to a pair of men and referred to them as a ""pair of f*ggots"" without a hint of shame. This man was extremely comfortable proudly displaying his homophobia.

If you want to pretend 1 person is representative of the whole that shit goes both ways and every single group has their dirty laundry.  Caitlyn Jenner for example clearly represents the feelings and opinions of trans people.  Asia Argento clearly represents the feelings and behavior of the leaers of the #MeToo Movement.  

Point taken?

&nbsp;

> As I say, no doubt people do feel pressure to be ""more gay"" and are labelled ""pretenders"", but as a whole, society is still far kinder to white straight cis men than anyone else.

Is it now?  I've worked in tech, video games, and social media and this is definitely not the case in any of those fields.  It's the exact opposite.  This is also true based on your location like Los Angeles or Austin or Portland.  Heck Even Houston is at the very least neutral if not leaning positive.  Despite being a Texas work city they care mostly about taking care of their families there.  

&nbsp;

Texas as a whole is going to be an interesting thing to watch in the near future.  The old views on Texas are outdated and people keep trying to make them stick.  But Texas has been majority Hispanic for awhile now, the irony of a minority being the majority of the biggest state in the country :D.  Its not the southern white boy redneck state people like to paint it as.  Not just in terms of race but also its got alot of tech and tech is growing fast.  Houston's even slowly getting some tech jobs.

If people don't change their views eventually there is gonna be a reckoning.  People can't downplay the Hispanic people's by pretending their all straight white conservative rednecks forever.",2023-07-26

"You're unable to engage with the topic, I see.

"Are you only able to see shit in black and white? There are many reasons people advocate for specific rules etc.

One is because of benefit to themselves and/or society. In most cases people in general think about how something will benefit themselves.

People however also demand rules etc. based on morality and one of the fundamental requirement people have from their government is that the government protect the human lives of society.

People also demand stuff based on empathy.

>It‚Äôs pretty easy to see how society benefits from everyone having access to safe abortions.

I agree but sometimes people are willing to go against what benefit society if that goes against their empathy or morals. People generally value human life more than anything hence a lot of people are against abortions.

>When abortions are illegal, people seeking them are subject to dangerous alternatives.

That's true but we don't make stuff legal just because people doing something illegal will be hurt if it's not legal. You will find people stealing even though it's illegal. These people are hurt by the fact that stealing is illegal. Why don't we make stealing legal then? Because we consider stealing wrong as it hurts innocent people - the fact that thieves get a harder life is tough luck for them.

>The real doctors who seeks to provide safe services are persecuted, wasting valuable skilled individuals, not to mention the resources employed to prosecute them.

If someone who helps society a lot does something criminal (like raping a woman) they shouldn't be punished because we are wasting valuable skilled individuals? What logic is that. If the law has decided providing abortion is illegal because it's considered killing a fellow human being then it's irrelevant what good they are able to provide society otherwise. They have still done something illegal.

>Children of unwanted pregnancy are more likely to lead lives of poverty and crime.

And children born from poor parents are also more likely to lead lives of poverty and crime. Heck children born from single mothers are also more likely - what's your point?

>Women who face unwanted pregnancy must often choose between productive careers, or lives of dependency on their family and the state. Women who are forced to give birth are more vulnerable to abuse by spouses they are dependent on for survival.

So? They are at fault themselves they became pregnant unless they were raped (see further down). Abusing your spouse is illegal regardless so... What decisions you make in your life has consequences - sometimes they are negative.

>There are many women who require abortions for no other reason than to save their health or their lives.

Yea and pretty much all countries in the world allow these women abortions.

>Finally, young girls need abortions when they are raped by predators, so that they can avoid the continuing harm of their rape, by being forced to care for a child while they themselves are still developing.

Yea and pretty much all countries in the world allow these girls abortions.

But just to argue against the point. Just because someone else did something illegal towards you - doesn't allow you to do something illegal towards someone else even if it makes you feel better or get a better life.

>The benefits of banning abortion seem to be limited to religious arguments, which have no place in our government, as stated in the constitution.

The laws are not only made based on benefit - they are also made based on the empathy people have.

What benefit do you see of not allowing parents to kill their 1 year old child they've decided they don't want anymore? The reason that's not allowed is because we have empathy towards children and as such we've decided that this is not allowed even if killing unwanted very young born children would probably be beneficial for society.",2023-07-23

"Sure. 

91% of rape victims are women. 20% of women have reported experiencing sexual assault, compared to 4% of men. 71% of human trafficking victims are women. In a marriage, when one spouse falls ill with cancer, 20.8% of wives with cancer are left by their husbands compared to 2.8% of male patients who are left by their wives (but yeah, sure, people always care more about women). Around 57% of women have their medical issues misdiagnosed, because the majority of standard practices/training in medicine are based on the male body. The ratio of top earners in large companies for men:women is 3:1. Women are more likely to live in poverty than men (11% of women compared to 9% of men.

* I support the goals behind affirmative action, college and ""worthiness"" is about more than test scores. Diversity of thought and experience is also important in building a student body, so if all of your ""best"" students are the exact same kind of person, you're going to have a lacking class overall.

* Women don't always have the choice to go back to work, especially when their partner makes more money so it ""makes sense"" for them to stay home. With the rising costs of daycare, staying in the workforce isn't always an option. We need to reduce stigma against resume gaps to help *everyone* in the workforce, including those who take time off to fight cancer or support a family member.

* There are studies and anecdotes showing how women are often discriminated against or discouraged from joining certain industries, like STEM and construction. I personally had the brains to be an engineer but was pushed towards the arts, and I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd had the opportunity to try it out... Also, the wage difference for pink collar jobs also hurts men who enter those same industries, who could have higher wages if historical discrimination didn't suppress the job category as a whole.

Why would not wanting to talk about feelings make it more important they should? That makes no sense.

I would like to clarify, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre weaker than I am, or that I‚Äôm stronger because I could handle the Barbie experience without feeling attacked. I just think this interpretation, that Barbie is anti-man, is silly. And that it is overly sensitive to be triggered in such a way, as a man, by some jokes at our expense. That‚Äôs all. This movie is not ‚Äúbigoted.‚Äù It‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôll be okay. 

You and I disagree about Barbie‚Äôs relationship with the male species. I think it and Greta are perfectly fine with men, they just point out some things about us that might not be the best qualities as a generality (not in the husband, he was just cute and that‚Äôs okay). 

But I think we‚Äôre not gonna come to some kind of middle ground here. I‚Äôd say we are both fairly contemptuous of the other‚Äôs ideas on the subjects of feminism and masculinity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue of strength or weakness, just sensibilities (one of us is sensible). 

I don‚Äôt have to re-read what you wrote, I am fairly certain I get the gist of it, though I will admit to being slightly confused by some of the grammatical choices in the first paragraph of the last comment there. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve made some oopsies too.

Unfortunately Long Dong, I don‚Äôt think you and I would make the best of friends. But maybe we can agree that First Blood rules. I like it a lot more than Predator, which I only think is okay.",2023-08-06

Okay so you are choosing willful ignorance. Have a good one!,2023-07-26
You are seriously going to tell me that misandry impacts your daily life to the same level misogyny impacts mine? LOL,2023-07-23
Barbie always promoted women's independence (to make money obviously not because Mattel cares about women). Why do you care about what values women have? Do you think you are going to tell women what values they should have ? Maybe just let other people decide what's best for them and you decide what's best for you. Stop being a nosy b-word.,2023-07-22
Fucking lol. It‚Äôs normal to assume the person you are conversing with knows how to communicate their thoughts without NEEDING them to be clarified.,2023-07-21
"Saying it‚Äôs rape, when it‚Äôs not is pretty fucked up. This movie was not rape. It was a movie. Ffs. You don‚Äôt have to keep telling everyone how bad rape is. Most of us realize that. We just don‚Äôt agree that this movie was rape. 

‚ÄúThe level of true empathy‚Äù so you‚Äôre just deranged then? Got it. 

You are quite literally missing the point. Your real issue here seems to be with Hollywood more than it is with the Barbie movie. You‚Äôre projecting your feelings about Hollywood onto Barbie. I used to work in Hollywood. I‚Äôve also done plenty of theatre and acting onstage. I know there can be a lot of ethical issues and sometimes things that make people uncomfortable behind the scenes, but that‚Äôs more films/ tv shows/plays/musicals. That‚Äôs not just Barbie. The film industry is incredibly unethical, so yeah, your issues with Hollywood, I definitely can agree with. I just don‚Äôt agree that the Barbie movie was rape.",2023-07-23
"You can call me a misogynist all you want. I‚Äôm not one. However, you‚Äôre ableist and use slurs, so I‚Äôm not sure you have the right to be labeling anyone as anything.",2023-07-23
You‚Äôre so silly,2023-07-23
