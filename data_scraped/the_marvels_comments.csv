It‚Äôs not great but I thought it was a good time, they didn‚Äôt dwell on things for too long and the action/fight scenes where they would teleport in and out was enjoyable. 

Some threads had people claiming they walked  out halfway through and saying it‚Äôs the worst MCU movie they‚Äôve ever seen, I can‚Äôt speak to that but man people seem exceptionally harsh on this.

"Not a terrible film by any means but just very mediocre and forgettable. The Meh-Vels? The Middles? Maybe the most ""wait for Disney+"" of all the MCU films. 5/10.

**The Good:**

\- Iman Vellani really carried the movie on her back. Her squealing and ""oh my god!!!"" was a bit annoying in the first act but once she chilled out a bit she had an infectious earnestness and enthusiasm that helped the film a lot.

\- Kamala's family were hilarious.

\- They let Brie Larson show off a little more personality and levity here which was good.

\- A few decent action beats.

\- It moves FAST. I could barely believe it was over when it ended. A back-handed compliment perhaps but it was nice to see an MCU film zip by so breezily.

\- I respect it for having 2 of the weirdest scenes in the entire MCU - the dancing scene and the flerken scene. I think tonally they do create some issues but at least they're trying to do something different and these scenes have actual personality rather than just being generic formulaic slop.

\- No idea why people are saying the Beast CGI was bad. I thought he looked pretty great.

**The Bad:**

\- The plot is just completely paper-thin and close to being actual nonsense. And to make it worse it's powered by so much boring expository dialogue. I was just mentally checked out as soon as they started waffling about jump points, quantum bands etc. Tedious.

\- Villain is one of the MCU's worst. Their motivation is actually really interesting on paper but the film seems almost terrified to engage with it in any sort of nuance for fear of making Carol look like a bad person or sloppy/reckless superhero. It just feels really glossed over. I suspect this was more fleshed out in earlier cuts of the film. Zawe Ashton deserves way better.

\- Some of the editing was pretty choppy. It was very obvious where stuff was ripped out of the movie.

\- Body switching gimmick wasn't used very creatively. Great idea but they didn't do much worthwhile with it and the film was totally inconsistent with when and how they swap. I guess you just have to check your brain at the door for the sake of movie logic, but it was noticeable.

\- The tone is a trainwreck. Perhaps a problem with the film being blatantly cut to pieces, but it rushes way too fast from dead-serious scenes to insanely goofy ones. Proper mood whiplash.

\- Monica gets the short shrift here, feels like a passenger in the story compared to the other two. Not great for a film called The Marvels.

\- One of the MCU's most forgettable musical scores. Literally can't remember a single thing about it.

\- Nick Fury felt like a totally different character from Secret Invasion. Just a quip factory.

\- Brie Larson's autotuned voice made my ears bleed. Thank god it was short.

\- I thought the VFX were mostly fine but those shots of the ship flying when Carol took over near the end looked HORRIBLE -  super fuzzy and ""smooth"" like a bad video game cutscene.

\- The final scene and mid-credits scene are gonna confuse so many people who haven't seen the D+ shows or have just a passing interest in the MCU - though going by the box office none of those people are actually gonna see this one theatrically.",2023-11-10 13:50:10

"I never thought I‚Äôd say this about a MCU movie, but it was way too short. The first act is much too rushed and needed more room to breathe. You can tell the movie was edited to death. Would have been much better as a second Carol solo movie before doing a team up in the third. Complaints aside, I enjoyed it for what it was.",2023-11-10 03:37:03
"Better than Ant-Man Quantumania for sure. 

Spoiler free: There is no post end credits scene so after the midcredits you can leave.",2023-11-10 03:10:29
"So much of this movie is positively fucking bonkers. A musical planet? Man eating cats with pocket dimensions in their belly going on a rampage set to Memory? Fucking CGI Kelsey Grammer Beast? Kamala somehow knowing the exact Nick Fury speech.

But really, the film can be summed up in the scene where Carol reveals her ""sing language husband"" can speak because he's bilingual. If this gets a laugh out of you like it did me, you'll get some enjoyment out of this. If you groan heavily, may as well leave, it ain't gonna get much better.

Other than this, this movie was clearly edited to ratshit in the room and some parts weren't clear as someone who didn't watch Ms. Marvel (how did Kamala use her powers without the bangles?), but overall had a good time. Larson is allowed to tap into her charm here, Parris is good, Vellani great. But yeah, the movie around them is otherwise an entertaining frankenfilm.

Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel - became a Disney Princess in the land of Songs, married to a KPOP idol /s

Kamala Khan/Ms Marvel - doing her best Nick Fury impersonation to recruit Kate Bishop for a Young Avengers team up 

Monica Rambeau - utilizing the ‚ÄúMultiverse Saga‚Äù by zapping herself into the X-men-verse

Had a few thoughts though regarding the Kree

3. When they flooded the sea's on Hala why didnt it tsunami or tidal wave

4. Why didnt they use uninhabited systems to rebuild Hala?

This looked like a made for TV crossover movie. Reminds me of power rangers. The suits/makeup looked low budget.,2023-11-11 21:29:41
"As an casual MCU viewer - it's absurd that I'm expected to watch and remember 3 movies and 4 TV shows to fully grasp the plot of one of these now. 

Like, they should expect that not everyone going to watch their attempt at a blockbuster is as invested in the universe as each other. A little exposition would be nice. 

I had to keep looking stuff up on my phone because I had no idea what was going on, and it makes me even less likely to watch the next MCU movie and therefore less invested in the franchise, a vicious cycle.",2023-11-18 17:06:27
How full/empty was your theater? Mine was about 80% free seats,2023-11-10 03:34:57
"It‚Äôs both a movie that has too much on its plate for its runtime, and simultaneously would be ruined by being any longer. The film has three leads, one of whom has only appeared in her own TV show, another who we only saw as a child in the previous film and has had the majority of her character‚Äôs status quo written in a different show. It‚Äôs a lot of balls to juggle at once, especially considering they have to introduce a new villain whose backstory is connected to the events of the first film, the premise behind the film of the characters swapping places, subplots ranging from using space cats as extradimensional storage containers for people to the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing a musical episode!‚Äù planet, plus setting up more things for Marvel‚Äôs multiverse plans as seen in the post-credits.

The best parts of the movie are the bits where they‚Äôre allowing themselves to have fun: the musical planet, the escape paw-ds sequence, and just the small interactions between the three leads can be bonkers in a way that‚Äôs able to distract from the Marvel formula we‚Äôve been watching for the past ten or so years. Making a longer film to expand upon anything (even the fun parts) would make the film drag and lead to a worse product.

I‚Äôve seen all the shows aside from Secret Invasion (hope that Skrull emperor didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of backstory in that that I missed), so I‚Äôm not coming at this from a place of confusion. It has good things going for it, but it‚Äôs taking characters we‚Äôve seen only once or twice and throwing them in the mix with too many other new elements for us to fully take in any of it.",2023-11-10 04:10:47
"It was fine.  Didn't out stay it's welcome.  Everything with the flerkens landed for me (especially the music choice).  The singing planet was creative but too jarring to work for me, and it got annoying fast.  Action scenes overall were enjoyable.  She-Ronan was completely forgettable and I think it would have worked better to start the movie with the backstory instead of just leaving me going ""huh?"" until the 2nd half of the movie.  After credit scene got a smile out of me.",2023-11-10 12:59:24
That >!Beast!< cgi was some Asylum Films level shit,2023-11-10 03:10:17
"i still have an issue where the MCU clearly doesn't understand the power level of its characters despite showing it in earlier things. why didn't Captain Marvel merely fly through all the bad guy ships as soon as she saw them thus saving the Skrull home and then afterwards the Waterworld? We've seen her do it and yet nope. Not to mention she could have tried the sun thing YEARS before but that one I can let go.

Also of course we have an enemy that counters light based powers: how about we send ANYONE who doesn't have light based powers at her? They even had Valkyrie in the movie! If it's gonna be a full 'girls get it done' thing at least go fully into it (not to mention her and Carol being so friendly despite maybe exchanging 5 words before this on screen)

coulda been worse, at least it was a little fun and the xmen showing up is awesome. I liked it better than the last one",2023-11-19 23:36:32

"As a fan, I liked the movie, I loved the twisted fighting scenes and the comedy was good from Kamala, it made me laugh a few times out loud.  


The cringe thing about the movie for me was the singing planet, it just didnt make any sense for me.  


The villan wasnt even in the movie that much and I was confused about her reasons at first untill we saw the flashback about captain marvel destroying the supreme inteligence, I dont remember seeing her do that in anything, was it the last movie? I didnt think it was in there so felt like I missed something.  


Other than that it was a good watch and tied up a lot of things, excited to see deadpool 3 which I think is where the MCU will bring it back into line, they are obviously going through a phase of change and this shows i the recent movies not being all that good.  
I still think this movie is better than Love and Thunder, and about the same as Dr strange 2.",2023-11-10 12:55:05

"I didn't hate this. The Marvel formula has gotten pretty stale and this might be the most generic villain in the history of the MCU but I still had some fun with it. Vellani puts this movie on her back and carries it. The Cats needle drop got a good laugh out of me. It was nice to see Blue Frasier.

"It's as okay as every other Marvel movie is, it's just that society is now starting to reject these. They put even less work into the characterization than usual, but there were a few fun scenes like the first switcheroo fight, the musical planet, and the cat thing. Plus it was only like 90 minutes instead of a two and a half hour chore. It's fine, it's whatever.",2023-11-10 09:12:05
"The hate was overblown. It has a lot of pacing/editing issues but it is far from being the 3rd worst MCU film.

Iman Vellani is PERFECT, Teyonah Parris has some really great dramatic scenes, and Brie delivers some quirky & silly lines that I wish the film pushed harder. Her surprisingly few interactions with Fury were great and it's a shame he barely gets to do anything.

Honestly, they should delete **'Secret Invasion'** because not only is it god-awful & worthless but Fury from the show and this Fury are like, two different people. If you delete the show, then it works better because he's just the same depiction from the original **'Captain Marvel'**.

The Khan family are icons and I'm glad they were in the whole movie as opposed to just the opening.

Dar-Benn is lame but her motivation is serviceable. Zawe's performance is as good as it can be with a script like this. Definitely a ""Phase 1/2"" villian. Ouch.

...

Also, I don't get the reviews claiming this film has ""pandering female representation"".

They never mention they are women once in the film. No ""girl power"" scenes...nothing.

Really confused legit professional critics said that these imaginary scenes bothered them.

Like, complain about the original **'Captain Marvel'** all you want, guys, but these ""scenes""...

They don't exist. Lol.",2023-11-10 03:40:31
"I hate the new tone of the MCU. The movies used to be drama with a hint of comedy, now it‚Äôs the other way around. This movie sucked. Kamala Khan is cringe, annoying, not funny‚Ä¶there‚Äôs nothing believable about her as a super hero. She doesn‚Äôt even have the athleticism going for her. I hate her character, even if it‚Äôs true to the comics. Instead of one annoying sidekick, she has her whole annoying family.

The singing and dancing planet was ridiculous, and not in a good way.

The villain was lame. The end fight scene was lame. There was no real buildup or payoff. It just sort of happened. Is she stronger than Thanos?

Captain Marvel‚Äôs costume was awful. Usually the MCU costumes get better as they go. How did hers go from Captain Marvel and Endgame, to the boring suit she had on in this movie.

2/10. Almost walked out multiple times. Couldn‚Äôt wait for it to end.",2023-11-16 04:08:41
"Feels like people are trying to say nice things about this movie because they like Iman Vellani, and I respect that, but honestly I thought this movie was a complete mess. Awful villain, pacing all over the place, forgettable action & the humor had me rolling my eyes constantly. 

I honestly went in with an open mind after seeing a few threads about how the reviews were overly harsh but after seeing it I‚Äôm not sure they were harsh enough. I recognize I may not be the target audience for this movie but this is bottom tier MCU content imo",2023-11-15 20:27:58
Walking through Wanda‚Äôs magic wall is the worst origin story in the mcu,2023-11-16 01:05:47
"Movie didn't bomb because it's a bad movie, movie bombed because no one cares about the characters anymore. The MCU is just... a bunch of guys now. There's no characters that you really care about, despite most of them having multiple appearances by this point, and they just... don't wanna see Marvel movies anymore.

People cried when Spiderman got dusted, when Tony died in Pepper's arms.

No one is shedding a tear over Captain Marvel, or Falcon-But-Hes-Got-Cap's-Shield-Now.

Marvel shifted from making movies about characters that we care about so that we're interested in ensemble films, to making movies that are strictly 2 hour advertisements for an ensemble film. They've gone full DC in 2016 - vomiting out mid-at-best movies to sell us the next movie, instead of making us care about the people in the movies we're currently watching so we want to see them with other characters we care about. At least that's how I've felt with lately every post-endgame movie, that wasn't Spiderman NWH.

Will be curious to see if they can pull out of the tailspin. Better hope they can, because Superman Legacy's casting so far has been amazing... The last thing Marvel needs rn is competent DC movies coming out to suck up the space.",2024-01-07 14:20:40

* It was funnier than expected, laughed quite a bit

* All the >!Flerkittens!< were adorable and that whole escape sequence was wild
* I figured there would be some multiverse shenanigans but I didn't expect >!Beast!< to show up, especially not that particular version. CGI could have been better but it was a mid-credits scene.
* One of the few times the villain had an objectively ""good"" (as in positive) motivation, but going about it in all the wrong ways. I expected >!The Marvels to all team up and reignite Hala's sun after cutting short the confrontation somehow!<.
* We could see the young Avengers bit coming a mile away but I didn't expect >!Kamala!< to be the one rounding them up.",2023-11-10 03:38:03

Or have one person in a big ol space prison and another grab the person, they swap, and bingo bongo they‚Äôre in space prison

"I feel like at this point Marvel movies are a litmus test for whatever you want to see. The Marvels has clearly been tampered with and edited to shreds and if you want to criticize it you can certainly focus on that. And if you want to enjoy it you can certainly find the fun in here. And if you want to like it, it is a perfectly fine movie with three charismatic leads. I think the main problem with this whole phase of Marvel is that these movies feel like they've lost their impact or any hope of standing out of the now 30+ show and movie crowd. 

I had an okay time watching this movie. I love the trio of leads and the concept of them switching is kind of fun yet chaotic. It's a bit too chaotic to highlight the action really well in that first house fight sequence, and the rules of the switching are really poorly defined and later in the movie feel like it happens when it's a convenience. Thought it was odd we got a whole (really fun, imo) training montage of them figuring it out, then the second it comes time to use it on the Ocean planet they fuck it up. 

But it's sequences like that montage or the really fun ""Memory"" scene where this movie is the most comfy. Brie and Iman are so charismatic and fun to watch. In the previous movie Carol was dealing with memory loss and brainwashing so she didn't get much of a personality, and when she shows up since then it's usually to punch and dip, so it was nice to see her get to let a little more loose here. Teyonah is great but her character is a bit more reserved and low key. 

The villain had kind of an interesting idea where Brie just shows up to her planet and destroys its economy and refuses to elaborate. Honestly kinda crazy that that wasn't Captain Marvel 2 because I feel like they really set us up for a major Annette Bening villain and then yadda yadda'd it in this movie. But the villain isn't given the time or the writing to stand out as anything more than a Ronan clone.

The main problems with this movie are how it feels so pasted together. It really feels like now that Marvel has set this long term precedence but also used most their recognizable brands that they aren't calling their shots as well anymore, and so a movie like this that has two TV shows of backstory and is also setting up major plotlines in the future suddenly feels less like it's own thing and more like it's in service of the big picture and the plot of this specific thing takes a backseat to that. It feels like things were cut out, rearranged, or added by people that aren't the creative force behind it. And that's very distracting.

Overall, it was a perfectly good time at the movies. I got a few laughs, a nice surprise here and there, but it's not in the top half of Marvel content and it feels a bit disposable. 6/10 for me.

Ps- that was definitely Kelsey Grammar, right?

The action scenes were legit, and the comedy was actually funny not so cringe you wanna shoot urself like it was in l&t",2023-11-25 07:24:17

"So after all the people talking up how good this movie really was in r/marvelstudios I thought I'd give it a try and watch it on Disney+.

My rating: 6/10...disappointing

The BAD

1. No backstory - No proper backstory or introduction of our characters. We have 2 new superheroes and you can't assume everyone has watched the shows. But nothing...We got a new space station, but no explanation of what it's doing. We got jump points everywhere, with no explanation of where they came from and how Earthlings are using them. We got a villain with no real introduction. We got bangles with again, no real backstory either. No real explanation of how the entanglement worked. Who are these 300 year old people on the space ship?
2. Poor editing - The number of times where sequences occurred with huge jumps in between was jarring. One sec, Captain Marvel is on earth, the next she's on another planet like seconds later. One sec Captain Marvel is on the moon's surface, the next she's up in the sky touching a jump point.
3. Underwhelming story. Captain Marvel destroyed a computer and all of a sudden she's blamed for destroying the atmosphere, sun, and oceans of an entire planet? WTF? They went from A straight to Z without any explanation and everyone is like, yup, she did it. Now we just gotta beat up the villain who has no powers of her own. So it's 3 superheroes, a teen girl, vs a Kree girl with a hammer. Yeah those odds look really bad.
4. Messed up power scaling. As usual the power scaling is so inconsistent it's laughable. Captain Marvel, able to explode ships by flying through them, able to jump starts suns by...exploding through them, but she struggles to fight a single Kree warrior. She instead spends the entire time turbo charging the villains bracelet with her powers. Even when she gets the jump on the villain, she's not able to do any damage to her. Punches, smashing into the space ship, nothing hurts her apparently. We never even got to fully understand Monica's abilities. And when it's a 3 on 1, why is everyone attacking the fricking bangle. It makes no sense that 3 superheroes are only able to hit one small part of a person's body.
5. Random crap just happening...What was up with the cats and the space station? I can't even tell what damaged the space station? Was it the cat eggs? Then the cats all saved the humans? Just a big  WTF. Then the planet where everyone communicates in song, another big cringe WTF.
6. Since when do the Skrulls have their own planet? The entire Secret Invasion series was about them trying to relocate the Skrulls and coming to the conclusion there's no place or planet for them. We don't even learn where they went to with Valkyrie. Are those ten gonna join the million others on earth now?
7. That ending...honestly I felt nothing after losing the new character we knew nothing about. And that too, why did it have to be closed from the other side? Again, another big WTF. Also, they never show what happened to the planets that had their atmosphere and water stolen... Lastly why is Captain Marvel keeping one of the bangles?

The GOOD

1. Ms Marvel's acting and dialogue were actually entertaining, as was her brother and dad. The mother got annoying.
2. Special effects were fine, not sure what people were criticizing.
3. I like that they're trying to tie in mutants now but it's kinda weird how it's being done.",2024-02-12 03:27:25
"Well this threads gonna be a shit show, but I enjoyed the movie. Was it high cinema? No. Did I have fun? Yes. Is a movie allowed to be that? Yes it is in my opinion. I‚Äôll probably remember the ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù scene longer than a lot of other bits I saw this year.",2023-11-10 03:46:39

"My very personal opinion:

1. This movie deserved the dismal box office weekend it got
2. There was no character development
3. There was no emotional investment opportunities
4. Acting was wooden and robotic (except Iman Vellani but one can only see so much fan-simp)
5. Nick Fury - where's the fury? Where's the angry man? Reduced to a pitiful, weak, clueless piece of acting that is just totally off-key
6. Singing planet was the ultimate cringe. I know in the comics, it was a planet that communicated through poetry and rhyme. This song-dance routine was like they decided the dancing/singing in Miss Marvel needed a part 2. Huge pass from me.
7. The casting for Dar-Benn was totally wrong, IMO. Zawe Ashton excudes zero animosity and has very limited expressive range. She ties with Malekith for worst MCU movie villain.
8. Flerken scene was funny, just about the only saving grace of the whole movie.
9. Post-credit scene was more exciting than the entire movie.",2023-11-13 13:25:19

This was so average.. like it‚Äôs not terrible but Jesus, Marvel have really lost their way isn‚Äôt it. also, try staying away from YouTube reviews they are all extremely negative and massively biased.. I feel like they almost need to hate on all marvel properties to keep staying relevant ? Watch the movie or better yet wait for it to come out on Disney+ (part of me thinks it will be out on streaming pretty soon to boost sales figures) then make up your mind.",2023-11-11 03:10:45
"It wasn't good.

Its just another Marvel movie but unfortuantely one of their worst ones. The action, CGI, and effects are solid and there are some good performances but it was mainly boring. The narrative feels sloppy and none of the characters were interesting. The direction was okay but it felt a bit all over the place, the humor is pretty rough and some dialogue is really bad. 

Overall, nothing much and was mostly boring.

4/10",2023-11-10 03:05:41
"I enjoyed this movie, and the action from the three leads, including Brie Larson (of course), was awesome. (Why on earth did these great action scenes look so lackluster in the trailer?) 

But we've seen two Captain Marvel solo movies and we still don't know what kind of personality this character is. Even with the exception of her first solo movie where she was ‚Äúon her way to finding herself,‚Äù Captain Marvel definitely felt like a stoic and harsh character in Endgame. I didn't think it was that bad. 

But Captain Marvel in this movie... It was just like ‚ÄúBrie Larson having a good time on a movie set.‚Äù It's so odd that one of the most important characters in the Marvel cinematic universe doesn't have a consistent personality, and I'm sure this isn't the actor's or director's fault. How many more years will we have to wait to really learn about this character?",2023-11-10 10:08:24
"Honestly not as bad as people make it out to be. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs perfect, but it‚Äôs enjoyable. Some of the more creative fight sequences I‚Äôve seen with the stitching even though it wasn‚Äôt consistent. 

Also, Iman is a treasure. I really hope big things for her.",2023-11-10 03:22:21
"Forgettable villain but honestly had a blast with the rest. Appreciated the tight runtime even if it did make some sequences feel choppy edited. Considering the simplicity of the story, I think the runtime was a wise choice.

I just wish the writers put more effort into the villain. It‚Äôs quite bizarre that after a decade of MCU villain criticism, the writers/producers think that this is acceptable. The actress did fine but the writing and character design were pretty meh.",2023-11-10 03:54:19
"The action was smooth and the pace was steady.  The story was ""wtf is going on and why""

The singing planet interlude was dumb and nothing that happened in it made sense - it only existed for the one joke and the ""give the characters their comic costumes"" scene.  The villain was one dimensional and left no impression.  The main macguffin is *never actually a point anyone really cares about* other than to say they care about it.  Most of the events have no reason to occur - *why did the station break down*? And the climax comes out of *literally nowhere* - it was never built up to or even hinted at, it just suddenly happens.  And I don't even know *who* was moving into that house at the end. Was it Danvers?  The Khans? *Both*?

This must have a whole other movie that actually makes sense on the floor",2023-11-12 06:02:32
I went in skeptical but genuinely wanting it to be good.  I am still in disbelief at just how bad it was.  I‚Äôm not gloating.  It‚Äôs super disheartening.

Normally, I don't think actors are at fault for bad movies, but what the hell was going on with Bree's acting in the field scene where she reveals the reason for the ""anihilator"" title. I've genuinely seen better performances in high-school plays. 

There were parts of the movie that I felt it started working its way towards being a good movie, and then it would take a nose dive. 

I'm not sure if it was better or worse than Quantumania, but it was certainly worse than Morbius.",2024-02-03 12:17:13

Not the worst MCU movie but bottom 10. Might be the most forgettable villain in the MCU so far.,2024-02-14 03:04:57
"To me The Marvels came across as Captain Marvel's version of Thor Ragnarok. It is significantly more lighthearted, positive in tone, and willing to take itself less seriously at times when compared to the first movie and I was in the right mood to enjoy that.

I loved the change in tone for the most part, but it does result in some questionable bits. I think this one will be polarizing also partly due to the marketing, which IMO failed to accurately portray the feeling of watching the movie in a similar way to what happened to Elemental. Like Elemental, it exceeded my expectations and I ended up more invested than anticipated.

Its biggest weakness is unfortunately the villain, that character didn't really grab my attention and it kinda feels like some of her screen time was cut to make the movie shorter.. her motivations made sense but the plot focused on the consequences of her actions more than her as a character.

I was actually stunned by the 3D, it is the second best I've experienced this year and one should absolutely watch in stereo if possible. The hyperstereo space shots were reminiscent somewhat of the spaceship bits from Captain Harlock - awesome. There's a glorious animated sequence near the start that is stylized as though it's in a notebook, and it pops in 3D much like Spider-verse 1 did in that format!

As someone who generally just adores sci-fi imagery it was a true delight in that regard.. there were some visuals in space, like those of megastructure-esque spacecraft, a biome reminiscent of the paradise at the start of Valerian, station vistas, jump gates galore, and planetary rings seen from an extreme angle which I really liked.

Although the movie grabbed me for much of the runtime, there are definitely exceptions and some inconsistencies in the visual presentation: the MCU generic empty field area does make a couple brief appearances, and a few bits looked rushed or flat. I'm guessing more reshoots or last minute changes occurred than for Guardians 3, which seemed more visually coherent. Use of the IMAX aspect ratio felt extremely deliberate in a similar vein to Guardians 3, but maybe even moreso in some places, to the point where I don't know how they'll choose to crop certain shots for scope theaters lol.

On a personal level I felt torn while watching, in the sense that this may represent the end of an era for big budget fun comic movies, or the beginning of a new one. I'd like to see more, but there is tough competition this month and I'm skeptical it'll be profitable... really feels like it could go either way for Disney again: a winner due to word of mouth overwhelming the marketing failure like Elemental, or an immediate flop like Indiana Jones. The production value is high and it seems like a full tier 1 project - for instance, the credits and even the post credits scene were done in full stereo 3D to the same quality as the rest of the production, which is not the case for all MCU movies.",2023-11-10 04:20:26
"Screw the haters, that was fun. The villain (forgettable, sorry) was just a plot device but the movies more about the Marvels relationships and history anyways. I‚Äôd watch it again!",2023-11-11 23:04:34
There was a Jack Sparrow reference and it made me smile. Overall this got way too much hate for no reason. Not even the worst marvel piece of media this year. 6.5/10,2023-11-12 01:47:05
"This has no excuse to be this generic, bland and still using the old MCU formula after 33rd films, the boring and dull villain, the good guys win in in the end, the important thing being the post credits scene.

And the production value felt cheap, like it was filmed on a low budget or in a single set, even GotG3 or antman felt bigger in scope but here like 20% of the film occurs in the villain ship and other 20% in the spaceship of Fury and it‚Äôs just so boring.

Also why was Brie acting Carol as Flash/Ezra??? Like an odd and introvert got when she wasn‚Äôt like that before, and Brie was still in Fast X mood with the same hairdo and shirtless tanks.

Overall it was messy, disjointed and felt like the season finale of a Disney+ show not a $270M movie at this point it must be a Disney scam.",2023-11-12 07:55:14
"It's a film with lots of fun bits (I know that's become a dirty word in these replies...) that aren't connected together very well. 

I know that's not the most ringing endorsement, but to read some of the advance talk you'd think it was as disastrous as Quantumania, and it really, *really* is not. (For all The Marvels' plotting issues, ""main character tediously resists telling her colleagues about the villainous threat"" is not one of them.) I also think it'll ultimately end up with less vitriol sticking to it than Thor: Love and Thunder and The Eternals.

This is a comparison that will probably turn off even *more* people, but honestly, the comparison that most came to mind for me was Thor: The Dark World. (Wait, don't run away!) By which I mean that there is a great action gimmick (the portal/gravity redirection stuff in TDW; the teleportation stuff here) that's the highlight of a film with some messy storytelling.

Because the connective tissue between plot points is *very* flimsy. I know people complain about the length of blockbusters, and will be relieved that this one is so short, but I think a few of these moments could have had a little bit of extra time devoted to linking them up more solidly. In particular:

* The Skrull Mayor's anger at Carol after the evacuation; the fate of the water/song planet after they leave (wrapped up in a single line at the end about how all the planets were fine); the convenience and timing of their correct guess that the water/song planet will be the next place the villain goes...
* The climactic threat starts off being a giant reality-splitting tear ripping matter off our Sun, and then switches to what might or might not be a *different* giant reality-splitting tear through which no material is flowing.
* I wonder if the first body swap was significantly re-edited: Carol takes the first one (from the barren planet to Kamala's house) in her stride, without mentioning it afterwards until after another one has happened. It felt like the final film places that first switch slightly earlier in Captain Marvel's POV than it was originally intended to be.
* Carol has been spending 30 years using that Skrull gadget to try and get her memories back? I don't quite buy that; she seemed to regain plenty of memories of Earth at the end of the first one! I think that by the time she's lived longer in space than she has on Earth, she'd realise that her attempts at memory recovery are probably hitting diminishing returns...

Fortunately, the central trio helps paper over most of the cracks in the film. Carol gets more moments of lightheartedness than she did in her first movie; she doesn't suddenly become a quipper, but the complaints about the first film that she's free of charisma and personality don't apply here. (The film also comes up with a good reason why she didn't return to Earth between the mid-90s and Thanos's snap.) Monica gets to be more than just technobabble-delivering scientist. And Kamala is as delightful as in her TV series, particularly in the best bit of the movie: her animated fan-comic sequence!

Also, Nick Fury is back to being more entertaining to watch than he was in the astonishingly dull Secret Invasion (which, thankfully, is never mentioned).

The two scenes of tonal whiplash that I predict will probably get the most criticism:

* First, the musical/princess dance scene. It gets away with it because of Monica's bemused ""what the hell am I watching"" reactions. Of course, I know that in itself will annoy the people who complain ""why can Marvel never *commit* to being *earnest* and *sincere*, instead of constantly winking at the the audience?""
* Then there's the herding cats/Flerken kitten escape pods thing. I'm not sure that really worked for me - it felt like it would have been more at home in a Guardians of the Galaxy movie than it was here. (Especially since GOTG3 had a big spaceship evacuation involving loads of animals.)

I misheard a line in the final scene: Kamala says ""Did you know _____ has a daughter?"" I originally misheard the name as ""Ammit"", and wondered why she was talking about the goddess from Moon Knight. Then I realised it made more sense for her to say ""Ant-Man""...",2023-11-10 16:07:05

-why even have a subplot of a failing space station?
-Carol reigniting the star was much more easier compared to how risky it sounded
-why does the Kree city look intact despite it going though a civil war that got rid of its oceans and put out it star?

"I enjoyed it enough, quite fun, I'm sure others noticed that it's the same plot as Spaceballs",2024-01-20 10:46:11
"I just watched this movie. Yikes. It was even worse than I was expecting. Definitely a solid F-tier Marvel movie. Here are my thoughts about the movie:

-Plot made no fucking sense at all.

-Brie Larson is super hot, as usual. But she was phoning it in this time and didn't seem that into it.

-Carol Danvers' character was at least better than she was in the first film and in Endgame, felt a lot less like cardboard this time. Though still a bland-ass hero, and still a lot closer to cardboard than a compelling character.

-Kamala Khan was endearing, and was honestly the most entertaining character. Everybody else was wooden as hell. Kamala was probably the only memorable character in this movie

-Iman Vellani was clearly having fun being a part of the team. She's cute and a decent actress, and I hope she gets more roles despite being given a shitty script to work with. She's Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen all over again with Anakin Skywalker: good actors working with a lackluster script (that said, Hayden was fantastic in Revenge of the Sith, but I digress)

-Monica Rambeau is still a bland, annoying-ass character. I didn't like her in WandaVision, and I didn't like her here either.

-Nick Fury is wasted. Not much can be said about him in this movie. He could've been written out completely and nothing would change. It would've been better without him in it, as there would be no lame ""black girl magic"" joke to be said

-The villain was forgettable and generic. Basically a weaker and less threatening Ronan clone. What was her name again?

-The action and VFX were alright, I guess. Not bad, but nothing special

-The Kate Bishop thing at the end was unneeded. They blatantly ripped-off the credits scene from the first Iron Man and Incredible Hulk with the ""we're building a team"" schtick

-Valkyrie didn't need to be in this.

-This was probably the most kid-friendly MCU movie by far. Lighthearted, bright, colorful, cheerful, no crazy violence, no scary scenes, not much profanity. This could've easily been rated PG.

-The ""song planet"" was stupid as hell. Reminded me of the ""Prince Ali"" scene from the 2019 Aladdin remake (which is a good scene in that movie, but musical numbers in Marvel films just don't work)

-The ""switching places"" schtick between the three heroes was annoying and added nothing to the film.

-The scene in the ship with all the flerkens was pointless

-As far as ""pandering"" and whatnot, there honestly really wasn't in this at all. That would've made the movie worse, so the lack of pandering actually gives it a few points

-It's just boring as hell, honestly.

That's about it. Very forgettable movie. Legitimately, it's like a child wrote and directed this movie. MCU stans will rag on movies like Godzilla: King of the Monsters from 2019 (which is legitimately an awesome-ass kaiju film, especially for Godzilla fans) and then eat this trash up.

EDIT: For MCU stans coming in here, you can't call me sexist or racist for not liking this movie. I have no problems with the leads being women and/or different races. The movie just sucks.",2024-02-09 02:38:31
"I wanted to like it but... it's bad. Ms Marvel definitely carried the movie. The editing was very weird though, and the writing left a lot to be desired. Plot barely existed - I feel lile the whole Hala problem could've been solved in a million easier ways. Not as bad as Thor 4 (no movie ever will probably be as bad as Thor 4), but definitely on the very weak side of MCU.",2024-02-09 20:37:46
"Finally saw it on D+. Sort of bummed, was hoping I would really like it despite the bad reviews and box office run. 

It was a mess. Awful, awful dialogue (whoever wrote that first phone call interaction between Fury and Carol should never be allowed near a script again). Disappointing performances (and I know all three of those leads + Sam Jackson can act!). Weird tonal choices throughout. At the end of the day they're probably lucky most people didn't see this because they could have tuned out of the MCU further.",2024-02-11 02:53:54
Just watched it. I don't get the hate. Sure it's no masterpiece by any means but it was still entertaining.,2024-02-13 02:43:09
"Just watched it last night on Disney+. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but it wasn‚Äôt great either. The villain was pretty boring and that singing planet scene was pretty cringe but I really enjoyed the dynamic between Carol, Monica, and Kamala. I also enjoyed the scenes with Kamala‚Äôs family. 

3/5",2024-02-17 15:28:29
"Saw it. was entertained. 

Didn't see it when it just came out because of poor timing. The Israeli-Gaza situation just started, and many in my country were swearing off Disney because they donated money to Israel. Going to the cinema would have made me a pariah",2024-02-18 06:18:18
"I liked it. 6/10 

Pacing was great, Kamala steals the show, it does a wonderful job telling its story in the allotted time, doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome, has the best post credit scene in years. I thought the cast was good, the directing was very good, and the charm of the Ms. Marvel series carried through to the big screen.

Negatives would be that there are some editing quirks that remove some of the logic ‚Äî things happen that don‚Äôt necessarily make sense or that haven‚Äôt been explained on screen. The singing planet stuff was cute at first but (for me) went on too long and crossed the barrier from funny to unfunny without crossing the mythical Seinfeld ‚Äúback to being funny again‚Äù point. And the fight scenes were typical unimaginative Marvel choreography, by and large.

It was a good time at the movies, and I recommend it to anyone based on the shorter-than-the-trend runtime and fast-paced fun.",2023-11-10 21:51:32
"Wanted to like this film, but it was a colossal misfire. Would not recommend. It's a 2 out of 10 for several reasons:

1. Zero threat in the film and from the villain. No one is in any real danger. So, didn't care if anyone lived or died.
2. Nick Fury, relegated to a lame comedic sidekick, could have been omitted and it wouldn't have affected the bland plot.
3. Tessa Thompson's 'Valkyrie' cameo made zero sense from a storytelling standpoint. Here's why. She and Danvers had zero interaction beforehand. If there was one, it would have been in Endgame in the final battle. So, their meet up in this film was disingenuous. What would have made sense and worked was if Thor appeared because he and Danvers had a couple of scenes together at the beginning of Endgame.
4. While Brie Larson seems to be an energetic and likable person, and, imo, did well in Endgame and Fast X, she can't carry a film on her own right now. Her acting in this film was flat and she acted like she didn't care to be in it; and her upgraded suit was sadly a symbolic representation of her screen presence - colorless and lifeless.

This film felt like the three female leads, as themselves in real life, had a slumber party where they took shrooms and hallucinated about some wacky space adventure.",2023-11-11 07:08:33
"Wasn‚Äôt the disaster some of the reviews made it out to be but Marvel needs to take some time off and really do some quality control. I enjoyed it more than the last Ant-Man, Thor, and Dr. Strange films at least.",2023-11-10 03:10:36
I enjoyed it. Don‚Äôt hurt me.,2023-11-10 04:21:26
"I honestly really enjoyed it. I thought it was much better than the first one. It felt more unique as it shows the Marvels losing time after time, whereas the first was fairly formulaic. 

Felt much better than the recent releases aside from Spider-Man No Way Home. 

If the first Captain Marvel is a 6.5 or 7 out of 10 for me, this one is a 8 to 8.5.",2023-11-10 03:11:31

They'll call us shills, they'll say it's astroturfing...all because we like something they didn't and they can't stand people having different opinions. And remember...we WATCHED the movie and came to the conclusion that we liked it.  But we're the bad guys compared to those reading bad reviews (many which we can ascertain now came from people paid to write a negative review based on what they said happened in the movie versus what actually did) and claiming the movies suck.",2023-11-10 14:16:50

"Marvel is getting neutered by Disney. They left the creative team mostly alone up until Endgame and have taken it a different direction afterwards.

More jokes, more representation, more ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Less story, less meaningful interactions, less cohesiveness, less pacing.

I don‚Äôt like Iman Vellani‚Äôs kid character, many will disagree with me but that‚Äôs okay.

Captain Marvel was okay. Not a big fan of Brie Larson‚Äôs acting, but it wasn‚Äôt the low point of the movie.

The pacing of the story was atrocious and all over the place. The Skrulls were a moot point, so was Hala, so were the Kree. The fights weren‚Äôt worth the lack of a meaningful plot. And the lighthearted interactions while cute, were extremely distracting.

This movie will regrettably bomb, and I can guarantee you it isn‚Äôt due to superhero fatigue or Marvel fatigue. It‚Äôs due to mediocre movies attempting to be blockbuster films.",2023-11-11 04:19:58

"I don't really get the hate? the villain has a clear goal that is interesting. The performances are enjoyable, Larson is obviously getting better direction this time around. Vellani is the stand out. The comedy mostly hit with some awkward jokes here or there but honestly there has been worse in the past. Plus they are connecting to the overarching plot points of the MCU (young avengers, multiverse/secret war) which was a criticism of the multiverse saga. There are real criticisms to be had (ex some shit effects like Monica putting the world together) but it just feels like people are circlejerking hate. I was frankly waiting for the movie to get bad and it didn't. 6/10- a 7/10

Honestly I think the MCU bubble has burst and people graded MCU on a curve that doesn't exist anymore. If stuff like Thor 1 or IM2 came put today they would be getting rotten ratings in RT galore.

"This might as well be a tv episode or a holiday special. Has no business being a $250m feature. The whole ""Carol is responsible for actions"" plot is so underdeveloped that it doesn't even matter in the slightest and on the other side we have a teenager going head over heels for her as if Carol is some beloved hero. How do you expect me to connect to Kamala fangirling Carol without giving us a fully developed and likeable Captain Marvel. Yes, Iman Vellani shined in her role and the trio's ""entanglement"" offers some fun and that's it. I didn't like Brie being reduced to a side note in her own film. She gets ideas from Kamala and lets Monica take decisions.",2023-11-10 10:20:37
"Not sure what to think of this film. The everyone needing to be eaten by the cats scene genuinely got the best laugh out of me at the cinema this year (on number 50 for the year). The absurdity of it. The film was just decent, didn't even need to mention all 3 leads were females which was well done.

But the plot was pretty basic given it was a short film, and it seems each Marvel film recently needs way too much setup knowledge from the shows. Stuff is just said on screen or done as if I'm meant to know. Feels like there were entire scenes deleted as well, was really strange. The acting was also pretty wooden by the cast, and characters didn't react in the way they should given their situation.

Like this is genuinely the first time I've saw >!Earth have a space elevator. A space elevator. No setup, it's just there and I'm expected to just accept that humanity has accepted it's there in the MCU all along?!<",2023-11-11 01:21:10

"It was pretty good. 

I had faith in Nia DeCosta from the beginning especially when it seemed like she actually understood what made Carol tick. It was a fun flick that reminded me of early 2000's comic book films but in a good way. Do I wish the villain was more memorable? Yes. But combined with finding out she was a Kree and the actress cast, who hasn't been particularly good in much, I was just hoping she wasn't in it much and she wasn't. She wasn't horrifically bad but she was bland and largely a plot device. That worked for me. Every single time they introduce a Kree villain I know that they're not going to be particularly interesting. Iman is hilarious and I'd like to see her in other non MCU comedies and action films. Imagine her paired with Ryan Reynolds or a screaming Matt Damon, it could work. Tenoyah Parris frequently makes me reevaluate my homosexuality and I'm glad Monica got more fleshing out this time around. I do wish they dipped a bit more into her relationship with Carol and her grief over her mother being gone but I liked what we got.

Brie Larson may end up leaving the role and if so she's leaving on a high note. This was Carol's best showing as a character ever, I'm including the comics because she's kinda boring there too. For once, she gets some actual fucking personality. Carol Danvers as a character isn't very interesting. As a kid, I liked her stripperific outfit because it was the most distinctive thing about her. There has always been a struggle to make Carol interesting across the various shows, films, games and comics she's appeared in. The problem was never Brie Larson. The problem was other writers not knowing how to make Carol an interesting presence. I think they finally got it right.

The fight sequences were fun. The humor was very much my speed. The chemistry between the leads was on point. I thought every single character not named Dar-Benn was utilized pretty darn well. I like that it knew exactly what it was and delivered on being a fun, breezy movie. I will take this over whatever the hell Quantamania was supposed to be. This was fun in a way that wasn't trying hard like Love and Thunder. 7/10. Looking forward to watching it high.",2023-11-10 20:16:14
"I have no clue what I just watched. The story felt like it came out of no where. Things left unanswered. The explanations of what was going on was a jumbled mess. The only good part was the mid credits scene to bring in the x-men. I follow the movies but when they start mixing in whats going on with the shows, nothing make sense if you're not keeping up.  I don't think I've left a Marvel movie more confused about what I watched than this one. 

The kittens was probably the best part though. 

&#x200B;

I really hope they can get a story line set up like they did with the Infinity Stone Saga. They keep throwing around the Multi-verse but there's not been a big bad shown like Thanos was.",2023-11-11 07:27:52

The film rushes to its conclusion as quickly as possible in the hope that you will not realise how bad it is. Making the post-credit scene the final scene of the film is evidence of that fact.

That being said, we see glimpses of what made the first two episodes of Ms. Marvel so great, more enjoyable characterization of Carol, and overall lightheartedness and comraderie that's been executed well only here and there in the latest Marvel films.

"I was suprised that marvel decided to release this movie considering the very vast strike that was happening. I would've pushed the release date until next year.  Got the stars out to do press for a couple of months and get the buzz happening on this. It makes a difference.

 That being said I loved this movie. I Laughed, kamala fan girling was awesome ! I loved the relationship between all three of the leads. 
I was reading that the villians motive wasnt clear but I dont know what folks missed in that, They even painted you a picture. 

I wouldnt have been mad about more back story on dar benn but not necessary. 

Carol danvers was sad this entire movie. Her character felt weighty this movie very different from the brashness of the first one. This danvers felt like a person that is very much still grappling with the world she knew crumbling, the new one she discovered crumbling and she cant quite get her feet under her. 

I wanted more of those flash back  scene. I wanted to see more of the times she did show up for maria and monica.  

I felt like it was a little light on the angst between monica and  carol they need another movie to work thier shit out. 

And shout out to Teyona Parris , shes so dope and looks so amazing as Photon!!! 

The cats song with the flerkins eating everybody and the way they let you know that was coming, clever. And those switch scenes frigging great editing....

It was fun it was action had some emotional beats that resonated with.

Fight scenes were good, and I like the three main characters but everyone else including Fury weren‚Äôt interesting to me. Haven‚Äôt seen Secret Invasion but he seemed almost like a different character. Editing was very clunky, scenes didn‚Äôt flow very well and felt rushed. One scene it seemed like Carol was very far away from the other two when they switch with her and get held up by Dar Ben but then Carol just flies in out of nowhere like she was super close by. The thing with Goose having babies just came out of nowhere, maybe I missed it and they alluded to it earlier though. It being the shortest MCU movie I‚Äôm wondering if they really gutted this movie to get the runtime down, possibly to get more showtimes in fear it was going to bomb. Idk not really sure what they‚Äôre thinking but it felt like there was a lot missing. I‚Äôm surprised at some saying it‚Äôs better than the original Captain Marvel movie, I need to rewatch it but I remember liking that one more than this.",2023-11-20 23:09:32
"I actually liked it! 

But I can understand why people didn't like it so much.",2023-11-29 03:14:42
"Just watched it, don't really understand the hate for it. It's a pretty basic Marvel movie. If your issue with it is Marvel fatigue then that's on you for continuing to watch something you're tired of. I'd put it middle of the pack of Marvel movies. Not great but not bad.",2023-11-29 03:54:53
"Terrible editing job and weak direction were prime culprits. But these characters were never going to supplant the Avengers. Captain Marvel doesn't have the complexity or the charisma. She's basically an omnipotent Deus Ex Machina. And there's too much pseudo-feminist character arc redundancy in the Marvel Universe right now already. That she's the most omnipotent such character doesn't necessarily make for an engrossing film.

I feel like it would have been a much better movie if they didn't take it so seriously and politicize it so hyperbolically. A kind of Ragnarok version would have probably been way more successful and gratifying.",2023-12-09 00:00:48
Just watched it and loved it.  I really liked the end credits scene.  I knew I would like this tho simply because my favorite Marvel movie is The Eternals.  I figured if that one was hated I would probably like another one that was as well.,2023-12-10 04:21:04
"Just saw the movie last week at the theater. Really liked it for the most part. Thought Kamala & Monica were great. The parents & brother were great. Carol was weak. (Not sure why Brie Larson doesn't connect with that character.) Fury had a couple of good scenes. The villain wasn't great. The story was enjoyable. Couple of plot points made no sense or left unanswered questions, but still an enjoyable movie. Definitely a girly movie.

I've decided not to watch/read previews of Marvel movies before seeing them. If go into a movie with no influence from the naysayers, the movies are more fun. This movie wasn't the quality of prior MCU movies but still had a good time with a few laughs.",2024-01-02 02:40:21
"I finally saw it last night, and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it! Did not have a Skrillex song and a Disney princess moment in my bingo card for a Marvel movie, but here we are and I was grinning the whole time.

I think the leads did a really good job and you could especially tell Iman was having a blast with this. Despite an admittedly shallow 3rd act, it was almost 2 hours of Marvel fun, way better than Ant-Man 3 which I felt like was super passionless and Thor 4 where I visibly cringed at some moments.

I think they should‚Äôve marketed as it was - a fun light romp that is certainly rewatchable, not this universe changing movie they were trying to go for in some of the trailers.",2024-01-17 20:39:29
"Pretty good movie overall, the big bad really needed some work to be honest, I get wanting to help your people while taking revenge on the one who doomed your planet but the way scenes were written the villain didn't have many qualities that would kind of make you feel bad for them.

And once again like in almost every other MCU movie the villain just dies.

At least they didn't directly tie it to Kang so Marvel really won't have to work around the ending and mid credit scenes. Kamala imitating Fury was sweet, but it's kind of messed up that if they ever film a Young Avengers project they're all pretty much going to be adults, which they are already in real life.

Monica's mom is Photon of the Fox X-Men universe? Or was she supposed to be playing someone else? Haven't read much in comics about them.",2024-01-18 05:51:35

"My review of the Marvels.

\*""The Marvels,"" the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, streamed into our living rooms, bringing with it a kaleidoscope of superpowered spectacle. This film, while threading familiar narrative paths, manages to elevate itself through its exploration of human relationships amidst cosmic chaos.  
  
Captain Marvel, often compared to Superman due to her overwhelming power, faces the challenging task of staying relatable in a universe where she could easily solve most conflicts single-handedly. This omnipotence paradox has been a narrative hurdle, risking the character's descent into an unrelatable, almost deus ex machina-like existence. However, ""The Marvels"" counters this by weaving a story that focuses less on her powers and more on the intricate web of her relationships.  
  
The standout element of the film is its portrayal of Ms. Marvel. She is not just a superhero but a vibrant, endearing character whose familial bonds add layers of depth and relatability. Her innocence and connection to her roots make her a compelling focus, creating a protective instinct in the audience akin to that of her mother's.  
  
The dynamic between Monica and Captain Marvel adds another dimension, humanizing the latter through their shared history and emotional ties. It's a testament to the narrative that even a character as powerful as Captain Marvel can find grounding in the complexities of human relationships.  
  
However, the film falters when it comes to its antagonist. The villain's lack of a formidable presence and an underwhelming scheme fail to pose a credible threat to the protagonist, undermining the tension. It's only when Earth's safety hangs in the balance, threatening characters we've grown to care about, that the stakes feel genuinely high.  
  
While the movie excels in its exploration of relationships, the traditional superhero elements ‚Äî the grandiose powers and action sequences ‚Äî feel somewhat routine. A more menacing villain and heightened peril could have propelled this film into the upper echelons of the MCU.  
  
In conclusion, ""The Marvels"" scores a 7.5/10. It's a commendable entry in Phase 4, rich in character development and emotional resonance, but it falls short of reaching the pinnacle set by the likes of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and the ""Infinity War"" saga. The film shines brightest not in its cosmic battles, but in its portrayal of heroes who, despite their extraordinary abilities, remain profoundly human at heart.""\*",2024-01-19 10:15:07
"I really wanted to enjoy it. I like the first one, more than most people I would say, I thought it tried and succeeded at doing something different.

This movie felt like it was edited to hell and back. Both storylines featuring the Skrulls and the singing planet just disappear and then the movie kneecaps itself by killing the villain before the climax. 

Also, I never understood the science behind the switcheroo or why it stopped, just felt very random and was a plot point whenever the movie needed it to be",2024-02-10 21:32:53
"I went in with so much positive bias and I'm sad by the results. It has bits and pieces of a good hero flick, but you can see how cheap marvel studios is being. 

- wtf is this editing. Honestly, absolutely terrible. Choppy as hell, makes a lot of the otherwise decent fight choreography way worse, hops and hops and hops through anything emotional. Just shit. 

- I WANT MORE MONICA. Wtf are we never going to get to know her or her powers more? Kamala and Danvers have prequels to establish them. Monica got shit all but 10 minutes. Ugh her character deserved so much better. Still praying for a better solo movie. 

- cgi meh. 
- fun fight scenes, but with 0 stakes because everyone is OP, kinda made them boring. 
- the relationship between the 3 needed time to become more complex, but I see the vision. Monica adored Carol and it must be hard to watch Kamala do the same, especially with how let down she feels. Carol could wrestle more with her split duties between earth and everyone else. Kamala could have her hero worship be destroyed, then renewed as she sees Carol for the flawed alien that she is.
- the villain is incredibly cookie cutter, but I still loved to watch her work. 

It was fun, Kamala and her family were endlessly charming and cute. I need a black female super hero like I need water to drink, so I got a bit of that, which was nice. It was colorful and funny at times. Wonderful costuming. Carols dress? Love. New suits? Also love. 

But ugh, so fast and shallow. 

I'll probably get stoned watch it again though.",2024-02-10 23:12:48
"This was the worst movie from 2023 I've seen. 

The MCU really did the heavy lifting for it for it to not end up the biggest bomb in history. The script, the direction, and the editing were absolutely garbage. The original Captain Marvel was actually a decent movie. This is like a collection of TikToks stitched together into incoherent and whiny nonsense.",2024-02-11 09:02:29
"Monica closed the anomaly, but was trapped in an alternate universe in the process.

Yan was the only one of the Aladneans to speak English; if you wanted to talk to everyone else, you had to sing. Aladna was a musical planet.

Captain Marvel had to make amends for what she did to the Kree; she restored Hala's sun with her energy and prevented Dar-Benn from taking Earth's sun. She destroyed two planets, did she attempt to destroy Earth as well?

The Marvels disbanded after Dar-Benn's death.",2024-02-15 17:59:08
[removed],2023-11-13 20:51:25
"I thought the movie reminded me of phase 1 & 2 movie, pure joy and fun, I thought the three leads were pretty good, this time, the script gave Brie Larson as Carol Danvers more expressive, so her back and forth with Monica and Kamala were pretty enjoyable , whether for fun time and sad time, and felt like she genuinely enjoyed herself throughout the movie, Teyonnah Parris felt like a good middle sister in this movie, she expressed her disappointment with Carol quite nicely, though I wished they would delved into this more. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is the one who glued this group together, she brought fresh energy of excitement into this group and made it more delightful.

The movie felt like a blitz, on one hand, 105 minutes for superhero movie felt refreshing, on the the other hand, some motives felt not as clear as I expected and I felt like conflict resolutions felt too quick, Dar-Benn has a bit of depth compared to Ronan, but still, they could've explored her a bit more.

All in all, the movie was such a fun time for me, in my opinion, it was good but not great and good but not bad, pretty solid in my book.",2023-11-10 03:05:16
"Just when I think it can't get any worse, it does. I loved the Ms. Marvel show, but seeing the trailers for this film, I really hated the way they represented her as this screaming, cringy sidekick -- she had way more depth in the show and all they let her do here is react instead of have any agency. Her final scene was the only time she truly felt like herself. On top of all that, if you have not seen Wandavision or Ms. Marvel, this movie does a TERRIBLE job of catching you up -- ""I walked into a witch hex."" They say it over and over, but if I had never seen the show, I'd be like HUH? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? Integrating show plots with movie plots just seems like a massive failure in storytelling, and Marvel just shit the bed in the least graceful way possible.

Anyway, literally had no idea what was going on in this movie. The plot was just jumping around and jumbled, moving from one thing to the next, often feeling like without explanation or time to slow down to give things moments. Feels like they had some ideas for random set pieces and just threw it in a blender but nothing stuck. I laughed at a few moments, but the overall experience was abysmal. I was fighting sleep after about 45 minutes. I kept checking the time, hoping PLEASE GOD just let this end only to find that there was so much more time left.

I'm a fairly big Marvel fan, but like the masses, have seen a major decline since Endgame. There's been some bright spots (No Way Home, Shang Chi) and I even have one I really like that most hated (Eternals), but in a very short amount of time, we have reached 00's DC and Fox levels of bad -- I'd rather watch Green Lantern or Wolverine Origins 10 times in a row than this again. The first Captain Marvel movie was the worst at its time, but I've grown to like it a bit more since than, but I cannot for the life of me see this movie regaining any brownie points. And Quantumania earlier this year seemed like the absolute bottom of the barrell but there are at least things I appreciate about that movie (MODOK, Kang). There is nothing redeemable here. This is not only by far the worst Marvel movie, but the worst movie I've seen this year, and one of the worst movies I have EVER seen.

After that terrible Candyman reboot and this, I can't trust anything Nia DeCosta makes ever again.

"Yesterday morning our friends and I were discussing what to do at night, we were thinking of watching a movie and we discussed The Marvels. I remember texting him saying ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre truly truly desperate and have nothing to do, we‚Äôll give it a watch‚Äù.

Well we ended up watching it last night. Firstly, the theatre was empty which was shocking. We've never watched an MCU movie where theres barely anyone in the seats. We all were confused as we didn't watch 3 TV shows that were connected to this movie. It was horrible, CGI is garbage (not the VFX's teams fault obviously), and the villain is also hot garbage.

The weird thing here is the geeks over at the Marvel subreddits love this. I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôd watch Captain America taking a shit for 3 hours and call it the best MCU movie since the last MCU movie. 

Do not watch this.",2023-11-11 12:05:04
"Why do so many comments say the exact same thing, I mean literally word-for-word the same. The ""I had low expectations but it was good"", ""it was fun"", ""singing planet was my favourite"" etc.. 

In a world with so many different folks, you'd expect a bit more variety in the comments - again, word-for-word. There isn't a comment of ""I heard negative things but XYZ was quite nice because of ABC"". Everything is quite literally formula of those YouTube bots, or botted product reviews that copy-paste the same thrases but in a slightly different way. I don't even see this on any other r/Movie comment section. 

I haven't seen a single person, in mass, that talk about the acting, writing, dialogue, story, pacing, other than the ones criticising it. There are many comments that do say like mine; puzzled by why so many comments ignore the actual film but copy-paste the same slogan over-and-over again. Again, why are so many comments saying the exact same thing word-for-word, but NEVER talk about the FILM ITSELF? Like, what was the writing? Dialogue? Consistency? Honestly. What is this? PR doing damage control due to low box office? For such an amazing incredibly funny 7/10 movie as people say, it seems to receive such low sales.

Feels like a bot army posting reviews than actual viewers having a conversation. It's just throwing me off. Anyone else scratching their head about this whole ""it was fun"" parade with zero substance? **Where is the rest of your review??**",2023-11-13 04:45:29
Kamala dancing to the beat on the music planet was hilarious. I'm almost looking forward to Young Avengers now.,2023-11-10 21:09:45
Wow. I recently rewatched thor the dark world  and it wasn't as bad as this. At least the villain looked menacing and the cgi looked great.,2023-11-12 13:58:59
"I just finished watching this, and it's honestly a 3/10. Half of this movie made no sense whatsoever. I'm really starting to feel like Eternals was a better film than this.

 For characters, Captain Marvel is decently better, and her character has shown some improvement I guess; Rambeau felt like those characters that over explains situations that aren't understandable to the majority (kind of like when Steve would tell Tony to speak English but worse) and her powers made no sense, and Ms Marvel the most annoying cringe character I've seen ever. The fact that she got this role cause she was a Marvel fan and not based on acting skills is disgusting.

Ms Marvel in this movie is annoying, and so are her parents, which took my enjoyment out of watching this. Kamala serves no bigger purpose besides the stupid bangles (which I'm assuming the bangles & the rings from Shang Chi are Kang‚Äôs inventions) which makes her character useless and annoying overall.

The villain can be summed up as the basic ‚Äúyou took everything‚Äù villain, which is odd cause she made it seem as if Carol blew up her planet when really they didn't have air, water, and the sun. Though I did find Carol‚Äôs vengeance flashback somewhat interesting, how her anger towards the Kree for what they did to her, but they did it so basic that I didn't get to care about it. Oh, and Nick Fury went from connecting all the Avengers together to being a guy who tells jokes the entire movie. 

The story overall felt rushed, and some scenes were annoying, and others felt like they shot the scene once, and that was it. And I still don't understand why the trio dipped when the singing planet lost its oceans. I only give this a 3/10 because of the end credit scene with the X-Men, but I wish it were the X-men from the universe where Wanda dream walked in.",2023-11-12 22:42:03
"A solid Marvel movie with some genuine laughs that has the courtesy to move pretty fast. It‚Äôs not perfect but it has at least one truly entertaining and cool fight sequence and a villain that mostly makes sense (Carol goes toe to toe with Thanos but this bad guy of the week gives her a hard time? Fuck it, it‚Äôs fine). It‚Äôs truly a shame that the cast and filmmakers have to endure misogyny driven reviews because women dare to exist and be on screen.",2023-11-10 05:16:42
"People who feel the need to defend this film because apparently this next addition of Disney slop is some benchmark in some identity culture war must be knackered. It must be hard to defend such rubbish.

If you legitimately enjoy this film and this type of film from Disney, then praise it for what it dies right rather than basing your liking off of who doesn't like it.

The film itself is another microwaved product that's no different to one's that were released ten years ago. Horrible editing, direction, and VFX work and a narrative so disjointed, it felt like it just ended abruptly.",2023-11-11 23:55:08
"It's light and airy and I'll probably forget 90% of it by next week... but it's still an enjoyable enough watch which seems to be the best we can hope for from most post Endgame Marvel (the phenomenal GotG 3 aside).  

**The Good:**

* Iman Vellani is a gem.
* This will probably get me crucified on reddit, but I like Brie Larson and thought she was great here.
* The use of the Memories from CATS

**The Bad:**

* The stakes never really fully hit home. We're introduced to planet only for it to get wrecked 15 min later and then introduced for another only for it to get wrecked 15 min later. Why should we care? Even the Earth threatening stuff takes place far away at the sun so it doesn't feel super impactful. And then at the end I guess everything is okay because of a line of dialogue? We never see either of the other planets again.
* The villain is kinda lame and boring. The general idea is good, but man is she bland. Also how does a civil war make their sun die?
* The entire movie feels like filler. Sure there's two teases at the end but for the most part it continues Phase 4's problem of not feeling like we're building towards something.

**The Underwhelming:**

* The film squanders some really good ideas. The singing planet is a hilarious idea, but then they drop it after its (admittedly fun) introduction. Imagine how much fun the battle there could have been if devolved into a fully choreographed musical number. What a wasted opportunity.
* Similarly the characters switching spots doesn't get a good payoff. It's introduction is again very fun, but then they don't really do anything creative with it. It felt like it needed some big third act payoff.
* The end credits scene fell flat for me. Like as soon as they mentioned that rift led to another multiverse I knew exactly what the scene was going to be (especially with Deadpool 3 coming) but man did they do in the most underwhelming way possible. The character wakes up only to be greaten by cameo character is so cliche at this point. And I guess this is a big picture gripe but are we going to persist with the Fox X-Men? I'm so tired of every film now trying to include a big nostalgia play... I was interested in seeing how Marvel would handle the X-Men going forward. I'm hoping the Fox cast is only for Deadpool 3 and we can some interesting reinterpretations when the Xmen make their full MCU debut.",2023-11-12 06:07:53

"no one is pulling apart that DB could have saved her planet really easily by just targetting other random planets, with no one on, and stealing a sun from an uninhabited system....

THEN could have gone on the revenge bender.....

"I liked this one a lot. 

I enjoyed how all the characters played off each other. The situations were bananas in a fun way (a singing planet complete with a Disney princess musical number??).

It was pretty much a 2 hour excuse to let Captain Marvel be more of a person than a cardboard cutout. There really isn't any defense of the plot, because it's pretty paper thin. In true Marvel fashion, the villain is one dimensional. But I thought the interactions between the main characters was fun. 

7.8/10 for me",2023-11-11 00:26:45
"Just got out of the theater, quick thoughts:

- Kamala Khan is a sweetie pie and despite the world at large not liking her show or her movie I hope the actress knows it‚Äôs not her fault
- how tf did Captain Marvel destroying the AI Overlord from her first movie result in Hala‚Äôs sun dying??? Feels like a separate thing! Stars die all the time!
- Captain Marvel turning Hala‚Äôs sun back on was also super anti-climactic, that should‚Äôve/could‚Äôve been a moment 
- cat gag was great
- Uninteresting Villain Lady was strangely and quietly OP, or rather, they nerf* and buff Captain Marvel willy-nilly* to fit the moment. Diving into a sun to restart it: no problem. Beating a lady with a bangle and a hammer: ahhhhh help me I need the power of team work 
- were Monica‚Äôs powers ever really explained in another marvel show or movie? I watched all of Wandavision, I do not remember this level of clarity on what Monica could do",2023-11-11 23:22:49

"Just saw it. That was some of the most fun the MCU has been in a while. Nia DeCosta managed to bring a little bit of her own flair to the movie as well, which really showcased in the opening animation, and the fights sequences.

Villain was nowhere as bad as I expected, and her motivation and plot were easy to understand. Zawe Ashton did a great job in the role with what she was given.

The whole cast had solid chemistry, and as many have mentioned, Iman Vellani is really the standout here. As someone who saw Iron Man in theaters at 17, it's fun seeing an actor like her be so thrilled on the MCU still, the way we all were in phase 1 to 3.

Wasn't flawless, but this was much more rewatchable, enjoyable, and frankly funny than a lot of recent MCU fare. Thorough had a great time with it.

Hats off to Nia DaCosta!",2023-11-18 02:15:24
"It is VERY clear that everyone who worked on this movie was given very impossibly tight deadlines, yet they deliver something decent in the end. The movie feels totally like the first draft of something better.

There are several things that are respectable in that regard, each character's motivations are very clear, which is rare in marvel movies nowadays. It also seems they learned a lesson to not put woman power in your face like Disney seems to do but actually put a vulnerability and human touch to each hero, which actually makes them actually somewhat likeable. Some hidden political ideas on how captain marvel is trying to police and help everyone resulting in the destruction of 2 civilizations is a remarkable idea too.

That being said, the problem lies in the execution and linking those ideas together. And I'm sick of movies portraying a smart character blabbering things that sound smart, stop it. On top of that, some say a movie is as good as the villain and I think they completely miscast he villain, she sounds like someone trying to be someone else. Nothing against the actress, she just doesn't fit the Ronan the accuser/Thanos kinda vibe that the movie makes her seem to be.",2023-11-18 20:29:01
"A lot of MCU movies have been a bit meh recently, so I didn't have sky high expectations, but this was a really fun romp. 

Kamala adds joy to every scene she's in (OMG when she started dancing), I really liked Carol. Monica fine. She mainly added some nice character development for Carol and some emotional stakes. Likewise the villian had a pretty decent motivation that directly tied into the main cast.

I also now need to see the full musical backstory film. I do not care what level of production values. 

Very fun film. Didn't feel like you needed a fuckload of backstory either since they basically reintroduced our three leads in the first men minutes. 

Excellent build in that final fight too. Loved the choice to start with no music and build up to it. 

Overall, it's in the upper half of Marvel films for me. Not groundbreaking, but also doesn't overstay it's welcome.",2023-11-10 03:40:07
I had a blast. Iman is a star!,2023-11-10 03:45:42
"Enjoyed the film overall, although it wasn‚Äôt perfect. It was definitely fun and they made some interesting choices.",2023-11-10 04:24:20
Most of the jokes landed and I really liked that the conflict wasn't with the team. The three leads had a great dynamic but Iman Vellani stole the show.,2023-11-10 03:21:11
"You know, after reading the reviews from RottenTomatoes, I was worried how bad this would be‚Ä¶

But it actually wasn‚Äôt too bad. It‚Äôs not a memorable Marvel film. But it is an entertaining one, with a really strong performance by Iman, who I did not know about prior to this movie since I didn‚Äôt see Ms. Marvel. 

I was actually impressed with a few fight scenes, as well as the cat scene where everyone is eaten by them.",2023-11-10 03:23:19
"All cynicism aside, I enjoyed it. The space sequences looked great in 3D. The quantum jumping was fun. Even when it briefly turned into a Disney musical, it kinda worked. Or that oblique Cats reference. By the way, it must be fucking horrifying to be swallowed by one of those things.

My only criticism is that it felt a bit too kid friendly. That was my complaint about the Ms. Marvel series as well, and especially the inclusion of the parents that made it feel too family oriented. But Iman Vellani is endlessly charming and it's relatable to see the world from Kamala's hero worship point of view. And it goes without saying, but Brie Larson is freaking fine as hell. That easily makes it watchable for me.

It was fun to see them recruiting Kate Bishop at the end (all the pieces coming together), and the tease of the multiverse return of Beast. And it's cool to come home and have the season 2 finale of Loki waiting for me. All in all, not a bad night at the movies.",2023-11-10 08:30:37
I loved it! I cried but also probably because it‚Äôs my time of month. The music choice for the comedic scenes were perfect.,2023-11-10 20:32:27
"I had a blast watching this movie. Definitely some weird editing but honestly some of my favorite action in the MCU. I think Nia DaCosta did a lot of really interesting work and the switching was a really cool device. Also the entire sequence with the cats made me die laughing, that was incredibly out of left field.",2023-11-10 20:41:52
"I saw it and liked parts of it, but was amazed at how much pointless filler was in such a short movie.

To me the whole Fury plot with the cat in SABER was all filler. The whole singinf planet was all filler. Even the villains motivation felt like filler. The bangles felt like filler.

I like the dynamic between them,  but they did a horrible job at explaining why the powers did that. It seemed a way to nerf Captain Marvel.

My favorite was the after credits scene because Beast was great. But the overall movie was meg, barely touched the lore even if it seems it should have.",2023-11-12 22:00:01
"Super fun start, but holy shit why are so many of these films not allowed to have good villains? 

Okay, so her motivation is that she wants to save her planet. Neat. We've seen that a million times before, but it's a good blueprint. But she has *nothing* else going for her. And then she just... blows up.

I thought wasting Gor in Thor 4 was the peak, but I think this might be an even more bland villain.

Still had a good time watching it thanks to the fun action and good cast, but the story is totally absent.",2023-11-10 03:55:55
"I ENJOYED this one. Some of the loose ends could have been addressed, like did the water planet get their water back?! Overall the dynamic was great between the three leads. It IS bonkers at times, and honestly, yeah that's why I go to the movies.",2023-11-10 05:33:28
"3rd movie I've ever walked out of. Zohan, The Spirit, now this.",2023-11-10 18:33:58
It wasn't as bad as everyone was making it out to be. By far the best part was the singing planet. I couldn't stop laughing at how campy it was. The power teleport shit didn't make sense. Kinda seemed like it just worked when they needed it to. Otherwise they should have been teleporting nonstop with how much they were using their powers.,2023-11-10 03:50:05
"i honestly had a really good time with this! it was fun, entertaining, and had a nice runtime. i absolutely ADORED every scene with Kamala and the Khan family. i wish there was no villain at all! or even any world-ending plot! i was happy just watching them interact and bond. I wish the MCU would move away from needing a huge devastating catastrophe to show these heroes' powers. 

I used to be a huge MCU fan, absolutely inhaling all of the news and easter eggs and rewatching movies over and over, but like everyone else, that kind of died post-endgame. so tonight, I found the required MCU additions in the movie (the post credits, the tie-ins to other MCU products) so cringe. even worse were the fans GASPING and CLAPPING in the theater at every reference. it was embarrassing, and even weirder when fans were mad there was no second post-credits scene. the trouble with the MCU these days is that everything is a set-up to the next thing, and nothing stands on its own anymore, and these fans are enabling that. 

also - was it just me, or did captain marvel herself take a step backwards here in terms of character/power development? she seemed somewhat nerfed, but also more insecure, when she seemed so confident in earlier movies.",2023-11-10 04:46:32
If I wanted people dancing like crazy I would watch a Bollywood movie!,2023-11-10 05:30:16
"I'm so confused, there's 300 comments and only one negative. Everyone is like ""I enjoyed it"", ""it was fun"". What's going on?

I saw it with a guy and he hated it. I myself am a woman and I liked it but only because I like female characters. I like Captain Marvel, Sersi, Shuri, Wanda, Yelena.

I will enjoy mostly anything with Captain Marvel in it, but still I thought The Marvels was badly directed and written. It felt like nobody was directing this thing. The switching made no sense and so much of the movie was just a recap of the MCU. ""Monica got powers by walking through a witch hex wall and now she can see the electromagnetic field and also she was blipped during the Thanos snap and she resents Carol for not returning to Earth"". It felt like reading a Wikipedia article. They spend too much time rehashing past events and very little time building a new story.

I think there is a good story in it, but the way it's told just doesn't register. For me Captain Marvel is a fascinating character. But it's almost like the movie is not told from her perspective. We don't get to see Carol living in space for 30 years. We get the perspective of outsiders getting to learn bits about Carol.

I don't like Kamala Khan. I don't like her family. That seems to be everyone's favorite part, but it's not for me. It's way too Family Channel and like they are trying to pivot into a different kind of mood.

The action I thought was poorly directed. Only Brie Larson moves in a way that suggests agility.

This could have been such a cute movie, but it has zero personality.",2023-11-10 08:07:41
This is the Love and Thunder of the Captain Marvel movies.,2023-11-10 08:08:34
"Did Tony, Cap and Thanos appear in this movie like the trailer implied?",2023-11-10 06:15:42
"Fun enough film. It was certainly weird, but a good kinda weird. Although, I wish is was Captain Marvel 2 instead.",2023-11-10 06:39:14
This movie was UNHINGED and I loved it. Felt like they could have cranked the insanity to 11 and then pulled it back either in development or post but man they did some crazy shit for a marvel movie and I‚Äôm here for it.,2023-11-10 07:28:40
"For the record, I DO NOT support online weirdos hating on the film because it‚Äôs ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. Nonetheless, I really dislike the film. I‚Äôve seen all of their stuff, and I might have to watch some of the others again, but I feel like this is one of, if not, MCU‚Äôs worst film‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame too since I was glad they gave Nia DaCosta this huge opportunity‚Ä¶ but both films of this Brie Larson-headed franchise have done nothing for me‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2023-11-10 22:52:01
"Really had fun with this movie, a very digestible and easy watch with some really great action sequences. The three leads were all very charming, especially Ms Marvel.",2023-11-10 05:55:25
The singing thing was just terrible I‚Äôm sorry it wasn‚Äôt even good or sounded coherent I get it‚Äôs basically just talking but damn it could of been cut out,2023-11-10 07:57:35
[deleted],2023-11-10 12:16:32
"This movie has the most underwhelming opening scene I have ever seen, just straight up showing the villain and the macguffin without any tension. That said, this movie is actually good if you put it in the same category as the movie where Nic Cage choked a  possessed killer robot.

About 15 minutes into the movie, I realized that if I just ignored the logic and plot holes, and even the villain part, the movie would become a really goofy buddy comedy. The song planet was surprisingly hilarious instead of cringe inducing.

For the most part, I think the cast knew what they are doing with the materials given. The chemistry and acting are great, there are some bonker scenes that suits the tone. And the forgettable villain was a good thing because I could enjoy the silliness of the main characters instead of feeling bad for the wasted potential of better comic book villains.

I don‚Äôt think Marvel had thought of the ending even after finishing production, because Carol‚Äôs arc just ended unexpectedly, while Kamala‚Äôs ending was the rumored after credit from a few months back, which also explained why there was only one pcs.

Some additional notes:
- The compulsory wardrobe change for merchandise is so frustrating as the new suits all looked like downgrades of the originals
- I chuckled when Zawe Ashton said kneel 
- Disney really made a film about the importance of an evil AI to civilization, and also a film in which an US militant destroyed a foreign region and just brushed it off for a couple of decades",2023-11-10 09:20:52
"There's a strong movie here. But this has clearly been chopped up like crazy and rushed too fast. Also, and this is a personal thing, I'm sick and tired of the ""aliens"" in Marvel to just be regular humans, it completely ruins my immersion and I don't care if that's how it is in the comics, it's a crime against worldbuilding.

But Kamala's great, and this movie reminded me that Larson is a great actress that's been given horrid material over these movies.",2023-11-10 16:05:42
"Correct me if Im wrong. But isnt Monica in the air force before joining sword. I dont recall her being a scientist. Yet somehow in this movie, she is so knowledgeable about all this cosmic power stuff and able to determine the cause and solutions to everything. Seems like a stretch to me.",2023-11-10 22:09:04
"I liked it but then ending was kind of meh



Kelsey Grammer showing up was awesome though. His beast was great",2023-11-11 01:31:33
"Okay this was a lot better than I expected. Not perfect, but a fun time at the movies.",2023-11-11 03:06:53
"I thought it was fun, although I admittedly tapered my expectations a lot due to the MCU's recent missteps and the seemingly lukewarm-to-bad word of mouth surrounding it. I actually thought the action scenes were quite energetic and creative and the chemistry between the 3 leads was the film's greatest strength. Everything else was serviceable enough to keep me engaged.",2023-11-11 23:01:01
We had a great time!  Loved Kamala and the Flerkens the most.  Cool to see Monica's powers in action.  The musical number was unexpected and adorable.  So glad I was not spoiled for the end credits scene!,2023-11-12 01:30:53
"I wonder if women like this movie. I‚Äôm a guy and enjoyed the first 80 minutes, but then I think it transitioned into the nonsense cut-and-paste ending we got in all of these movies.

I‚Äôve never seen a superhero movie where the leads are three women. I feel like the tone, imagery, and musicality tried to deliver the type of entertainment for women that I get from watching a superhero movie. Curious if this connected with women.",2023-11-12 03:03:15

"Hear me out.  
We kick out Monica and Kamala.  
We keep the stoic, powerful, quasi awkward Carol of Larson.  
We go full (space) knight x prince. Do a traditional Romance, with two opposite temperatments, like you usually do knight x princess, but do it prince x knight this time. Badass action woman space knight, and also romance. And some singing. Like a Disney princess movie, only the princess is Larson's Carol, fulfilling the knight's role. And a spacehunk prince.  
It'd have done wonders.  
Wonders.",2023-11-12 19:03:09
So what happened to the hole in that water planet? I'm not sure if that was addressed.,2023-11-12 20:12:02

Was it shown in Ms. Marvel or elsewhere? The Captain Marvel movie?

I can't remember and haven't watched some of the recent stuff.",2023-11-13 06:29:18
"I just got out of seeing this in IMAX 3D, and I thought it was pretty meh. There are certainly positive aspects to be found here, and it isn‚Äôt the worst MCU film by any means, but here are a few random thoughts off the top of my head:

- The singing planet was like my own version of hell. Everybody there annoyed me to no end.

- The performances here were incredibly hit and miss. I generally like Brie Larson, but she isn‚Äôt that great in this film. Like everybody else is saying, Ms Marvel completely steals the show.

- The visuals were pretty good in IMAX, but there‚Äôs a few times where the obvious green screen takes you out of it a little bit.

- The gags are solid enough, and they certainly aren‚Äôt as annoying as some of the jokes used in Ant-Man 3 or Thor 4.

- While I liked the post-credit scene, it felt a little unearned and out of nowhere to me. 

- It really felt like there were aspects of this film that were rushed or heavily cut. The villain of this film suffers the most from this. 

It‚Äôs weird, because I didn‚Äôt love the movie, yet I was strangely entertained. A lot of things were generic, but it was almost like a fun amusement park ride.",2023-11-13 22:48:44
"So uh...I figured (based on the buzz surrounding it but not knowing any actual details whatsoever) that we'd be getting an X-Men *tease* for the stinger. Maybe a quick offhand mention of the Xavier school, Senator Kelly getting a name drop, etc...
  
I could never have imagined what we actually got. As soon as I saw that brief flash of blue and heard the very first word in *that voice,* I sat straight the fuck up in my seat. God, I hope he doesn't end up being a one-off bone toss like Reed Richards.",2023-11-15 04:51:18
"Carol Danvers is the MCU Superman in the sense we are yet to have a proper movie that is an actual outlet for her to have a Captain Marvel adventure. First one was her origin. This one feel like the third movie. 

How come in a super expansive ""well"" threaded universe we never got a Captain Marvel in space movie??? I can only assume the ""changes"" Feige imposed on Gunn regarding the direction of Guardians 2 had to do with hoa ""Space"" aspect of the MCU got shafted. 

It feels like the Kree had to have something beyond Captain Marvel (the movie) and Guardians. 

So Universe rant aside, the movie is actually fine? A lot of the plot overall is bad, some parts are not done that well (I.E Kamala witnesses the skrulls get genocideed and then they sort of shake it off)

If this movie had come earlier it would probably have gotten better reviews, but at this point people will be tired. I enjoyed more than I disliked, but I can see people being exhausted of this without any of the old leads. It's not spectacular in way you ""have"" to watch it but many people would actually have enjoyed it. Post credit scene being the most worthwhile thing I guess. Maybe too little too late for that, we'll see.",2023-11-18 04:25:01
"felt like an overall 7/10

obviously was not ""terrible"". glad it wasnt filled with a shit ton of jokes, but also wish it was a bit more serious. dar'benn didn't feel like a menacing hero but i did enjoy seeing the 3 of them learn to work together

generally a lot of random things that just didn't feel fitting. random valkyrie cameo, random musical, random cats everywhere. was happy to see captian marvel blast through ships again since she obviously had to be nerfed for the movie. overall, better than quantumania for sure, but nowhere close to as good as the loki series level of quality",2023-11-18 22:41:25
"I thought the movie was pretty enjoyable. Just had some comments and wondering what others thoughts were:

1) did they imply a relationship between Valkyrie and carol, or am I reading too much and it's supposed to just be a friendship?

2) ok so after the final fight, kamala puts on both bands and they close the hole. But when kamala land son earth, she's only wearing one band. I'm assuming this was just a mistake due to re editing, but right now kamala is supposed to have both bands?

3) why can Kamala handle using both bands when it destroyed the villain in moments? Is it because she has some Noor DNA?",2023-11-19 05:59:28

"This was leagues above Captain Marvel. At least Carol Danvers isn‚Äôt a plank of wood. The movie is distinctly average, I remember just being bored through whole thing. Better than Ant-Man 3 but overall pretty forgettable. I‚Äôd be more excited for the X-Men if they were being brought in at a time when the MCU hadn‚Äôt been reduced to a mere shell of its former self.",2023-11-11 05:34:29
"All the good reviews described a movie that I wanted to see, and I think there were all pretty accurate! I had a great time, the three leads were all great and played of each other really well. Marvel have Carol the most personality out of all her appearances so far, Monica's story is developing really well, and Iman Vellani continues to be perfect as Kamala.

I really don't know where the bad reviews are coming from. I guess a few aspects are undercooked, or maybe overcooked because of all the delays. The musical planet for example, I would have loved to see way more of that concept, but I think early responses to that idea were so negative they were forced to edit that down.",2023-11-11 14:55:13
Beast looked atrocious. Why CGI?,2023-11-11 16:55:47
"Great Marvel comedy. As expected, Iman Vellani steals the show as the wholesome fan girl. 

The first act was a little rough, I thought. Introducing the place swapping seemed a little more jarring than it should have been. Wasn‚Äôt sold on the baddie, but I‚Äôd rather have a throwaway for something like this than an A lister. 

Since I‚Äôm not familiar with Photon, I‚Äôm not sure what her power set actually includes, but I feel like we were playing very loose with who can and can‚Äôt breath in space.

The cat scene was‚Ä¶ a lot.

Whatever sins were committed, though, are immediately forgiven on account of the mid-credit scene. Just give them to me, Marvel. Give them to me nowwwwwwww.",2023-11-11 19:39:07
"I think people are being a little harsh, I thought this movie was fun!

Overall, I think people need to just lower expectations. MCU had a great run with the Infinity Saga. But maybe these movies going forward should just be viewed as mindless superhero flicks.

They‚Äôre not bad movies, just not anything special and I think that‚Äôs okay. Just work on the oversaturation and release regular content. There is an audience for these even if the general public has moved away and interest has waned.

Every once in awhile we‚Äôll get an Across The Spider-Verse. But until then I‚Äôm fine with a two hour superhero escape even if it isn‚Äôt the next Best Picture winner.",2023-11-11 22:10:58

"Call me basic but yeah this was actually pretty great. I havent watched any of the TV shows outside of wandavision so I'm probably missing a lot but I feel it didnt really negatively effect my enjoyment of the movie.

Loved the singing planet and herding of the cats bit and the usual cheesy humor and quips worked better for this movie than other MCU films.Excited to see more of Kamala.

Solid 7/10 for me",2023-11-10 05:18:05
"Not gonna lie, I cannot for the life of me understand the hate for this one. Fixes so many universal MCU complaints; it‚Äôs quick, creative, fun, pretty good VFX, great fights, etc. Honestly one of the stronger MCU offerings in a hot second, barring Guardians 3. 

I will say the Flanderization of Nick Fury is brutal, his character is completely dead at this point. Iman Velani is the best casting to happen to the MCU since RDJ as Tony.",2023-11-10 22:59:46

"Great movie 8/10 don't understand the hate! Blows away Quantumania, love and thunder and whatever DC released this year.",2023-11-11 00:45:05
"I really really liked it. Was it groundbreaking? No. Was the villain particularly memorable? No. But the dynamic between Carol, Kamala and Monica was amazing. That's what made the movie. All three of them played their characters great but Iman really took an already great character on her show and went to another level. She's seriously the best.

The movie had a nice tone of serious but still absurd. It felt like an early MCU meets Guardians style. Like yes there were literal world ending stakes but it was for a world of dancing/singing people. Or hundreds of people may die...unless they let adorable Flerkins eat them. It worked. What they did worked.

Usually the MCU sarcasm interjection sucks but Kamala butting in was legitimately hilarious. Again that goes back to Iman, she's just so likeable in this role. 

Speaking of roles. How can the MCU fuck Fury up so badly in Secret Invasion while also filming this? I guess that shows how there isn't necessarily a lot of communication when it comes to crossing over. Remember Gunn being against Thor leaving with the Guardians in Endgame? Anyway I'm glad we didn't see Fury's wife, maybe Secret Invasion will be wiped clean.

Like I said the villain was forgettable but her origin was pretty interesting. It was nice that it actually tied back to the first movie. Her intentions weren't too bad either, I mean Captain Marvel did basically destroy her planet. So from her perspective she was right.

The credits scenes were both amazing. Again Iman killed it. Kate Bishop is one of my favorite characters from the Disney+ shows so I was excited to see her. And of course how can you not be fucking hyped about seeing another X-Men character? Especially since they kept Grammer! Beast looked so cool!

Anyway I enjoyed it. It was a fun ride and it was better than a lot of what Marvel Studios has given us since Endgame.",2023-11-11 05:05:29
"Carol had some really great character development here. Strongest mcu hero physically but based on her decision making actually did more harm than good, which is an interesting angle to play for her and made her much more likable than the first film. I really liked her arc. Previously didn't really need her in the avengers, but now I'd really like her presence moving forward!",2023-11-11 21:06:28
Wtf this movie is actually pretty good. The fight scenes in this movie are surprisingly sick. I also really like Carol and Monica‚Äôs relationship in this movie. Hell the trio of them were pretty great together. I liked it,2023-11-11 23:00:21
The only Marvel movies worse than The Marvels are: Thor Love and Thunder and Quantumania.  The only advice for those who haven't seen The Marvels is:  Wait and watch it on Disney+ in a few weeks.,2023-11-12 02:29:51

"I can totally understand why people might not like it, but I enjoyed it for what is. It is silly and lighthearted. It doesn't quite have that emotional weight, but I liked the dialogue and the cast works well together.

I'd put it somewhere around Ant-Man 1 in the list of MCU films. That's middle of the pack, but fairly good for Phase 4/5.

The lady sitting next to me was loving it and would say ""oh my god"" every time something cool happened or there was a cameo. It was more endearing than annoying. I wanted to respond back with ""I knooowwww""

I didn't catch all the thank yous, but I saw Kelly Thompson and G Willow Wilson",2023-11-10 05:59:27

Only thing that bothered me was, did the Kree civil war do something to destroy their sun? I get they're advanced, but...that's a lot.

Or was it it just a cosmic coincidence their sun started dying the same time they destroyed their planet anyway?!",2023-11-10 20:11:36

"I liked the characters well enough except for Captain Marvel herself who is kind of an asshole. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs supposed to be an allegory for military/policing sometimes being wrong or what. I get not being perfect and the villain side demonizing her but there were simple moments of asshole behavior beyond that, like her barely apologizing and brushing off triggering Monica‚Äôs worst memories. And that scene was the other issue, the sudden tonal shifts, they go from trauma to the training montage within a minute.

"What happened to the other bangle?  Kamala uses both to charge up Monica, she has both when she hugs Carol after Monica is sealed away, then when Kamala returns to Earth, it's gone.

"Finally watched it, it wasn't that bad, I actually enjoyed the chemistry between the Marvels, I really hated how Carol didn't think on fixing  Hala's sun, it took her less than a minute to actually fix it, but she waited 30 years, a villain and someone asking her to fix things

The end scene with Kamala was poorly explained, no reason for her to recruit young Avengers other than make another movie/series

The post credits scene was fine, I felt bad when the Maria Rambeau had no idea who Monica was",2024-03-26 19:53:16
"This was a lot of fun. Loved the (somewhat sloppy) concept and the leads were fantastic together.

"The majority will hate this movie. But I didn‚Äôt hate it for a few reasons. 

Indian girl Kamala carried the movie she was very charming and just genuinely funny.

Fight choreography between the 3 of them was a lot of fun. Their chemistry was great. 

Nick fury, Kate bishop always hype if they‚Äôre on screen 

It suffered from honestly bad story telling, it was all very copy paste, knew exactly how it was going. The villain was annoying, and they did those weird annoying cringe things that Disney does now. Thor with the screaming goat, ant man with the MODOK dude, captain marvel with a planet where their language is singing -__-",2023-11-10 05:24:37
"When I say headlines saying it was the third worst film, I was really worried.
I also heard there was some change in staff or directors leaving, which is normally not a good sign for a movie.

But really? Loved it. All 3 leads were great (So proud of Iman Vellani), and there were parts that were silly, but not too silly that it breaks the tone of the movie or lowers the stakes going on.

Also, love the cameo at the end. I could be biased but I thought it was great.",2023-11-13 05:21:31

"This movie had some amazing high moments.

And some really low moments that honestly felt like could have been expanded and refined.

You can see the trio has enough ability to make some of these scenes work but they must have had like 3 takes and called it at some points. The reveal or Carol creating the problem was just like people reading off a script. There was minimal at most emotion. You could have easily doubled the length of that scene, added some real emotional dialogue.

Also where the hell did the 2nd Bangle go? Kamala wasn't wearing it",2023-11-10 03:20:02
"The Marvels is a pitch for a pilot on Kickstarter one might use to communicate the basic concept of an intended film.  The movie it's pitching could have been really cool, had anyone taken the time to make it,  but because it remains just preliminary sketches of moments and bits and pieces of action, it lacks the connective tissue, tonal consistency, character development, and stakes of a finished artistic project.  I wouldn't even call this a movie - it's barely a rough draft.

Here are the major problems, the implied intended arcs that were not fleshed out,  and possible solutions:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 1)  Carol's arc flows about as smoothly as a monkey wrench through a colon, her emotional breakdowns are tonally and narratively inconsistent, and her journey and consequently the movie as a whole, lacks a satisfying resolution.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTENDED ARC 1)

A) Carol follows through on her vow of revenge and kills the Supreme Intelligence

B) This causes political and environmental chaos on Hala

C) She feels guilty and runs away from this uncomfortable consequence of her actions and tries to make amends by remaining in space alone doing good deeds, feeling that she is not worthy to return to Monica.  She feels that seeing Monica again will awaken sad feelings about Maria's death and her own guilt that she could not prevent it.

D)  She meets Kamala and initially sees her as naive and a burden, another annoying problem to deal with.

E) She meets Monica and is initially put off by her emotional distancing and anger.

F)  Carol tries again to distract herself from feelings of guilt with solitary violence.  She views the switching as an annoying problem that must be solved.

G)  After seeing Kamala try her hardest to save others and find satisfaction in even partial successes, she begins to respect Kamala's abilities and more seriously consider the benefits of working as a team.

H) By talking to Kamala and seeing her family interactions, Carol is reminded of the good she can do in the world and the positive ideal she still represents.  Carol sees the value of family and community and begins to open up more to the idea of reconnecting with Monica.

I)  She shares the Vulca- um, Skrull mindmel- um mind... link? with Monica and comes to an emotional understanding of the suffering and loneliness Monica has also endured.

J)  She talks to Monica about her mother and shares her feelings and shared grief.

K)  Dar-benn explains her motivations to Carol, and she is reminded of her guilt.

M)  She breaks down emotionally and admits to Monica and Kamala that she is responsible for the decline of Hala.  This admission brings them closer together.

N)  Carol begins to see the switching as a potential strength, starts to value the abilites of Monica and Kamala.  A training montage reinforces the idea of the three as a team.

O)  The power of friendship prevails and the three are able to defeat Dar-benn.

P)  Monica's sacrifice and Kamala's admiration inspire her to make her own ultimate sacrifice by using more power than she has ever before to reignite Hala's sun.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS 1)

In order for a character arc to succeed, there needs to be a rhythm, with extra emphasis on important points, namely the beginning, inflection points, and end of the arc.  The transitions from each point in the arc should be smooth and believable.

Carol is a person who bottles up her emotions and doesn't like to show weakness, so some abruptness is to be expected when she eventually breaks down to Monica.  She also deflects strong emotions with sarcasm and humor, so some wry asides and jokes are to be expected.

However, the emotional break down is waaaaay too abrupt and extreme, and it is ineffective because we haven't seen any of Carol's inner emotional struggles up until that point.  She's releasing tension that the audience isn't even really aware of until that moment, and immediately afterward is back to taking nothing seriously.

A) and C) needed to be shown clearly at the beginning of the movie to establish how powerful she is, and how that power and the problems it caused on Hala were isolating and that power alone was unable to soothe or address her feelings of guilt about both Hala and Monica.

H) I) J) and M) are the important inflection points.  There are a lot more than usual because this movie is juggling essentially Carol's relationship to three different characters if we include Dar-Benn.  H) needs a little more time in the oven.  It should have been spelled out more clearly to the audience that Carol was noticing Kamala's family interactions and admiration and that they were slowly having a personal effect.

I) was actually handled pretty well.  If there was a serious conversation about Carol and Maria's relationship and what her death meant for both Carol and Monica, it would be fine, but that  J) discussion never really occurs in the movie at all, so the group hug doesn't land like it should.

M) is not a bad scene in isolation, but because of the prior weaknesses in C) H) I) and J) it has almost no emotional impact.  And because it is immediately followed by horribly forced comedy from Fury and Carol when they are supposedly dealing with the potential destruction of entire planets of people they care about, any minor impact her breakdown might have had is immediately undermined and cheapened and evaporates in a fog of Saturday morning cartoon goofiness.

The fight at O) is horribly choreographed and shot.  It should be the coolest fight in the movie,  but the cuts are fast, the camera is zoomed in tight, and the spacing is ambiguous.  It's by far the worst fight in the film.  The final strike is shot so poorly, it's hard to even tell what's happening.   This fight should showcase the three using the switching power in inventive ways and falls very flat.  It looks as if the final moments of the fight were hastily spliced together at the last moment using left over footage from previous scenes.

P) should mirror Monica's sacrifice.  It is a ludicrously overpowered feat that should have been a long, drawn-out special effects extravaganza a la Thor holding the forge open.  Monica made a huge sacrifice - Carol should have been depowered to some extent by the act, even if she was able to gain it back in later films.  There need to be stakes to an act that grand and important.  It essentially is the closing of her arc, and to borrow a phrase, reigniting a dying star and resolving the feeling of guilt that is supposedly the primary emotional impetus for this entire movie turns out to be actually super easy, barely an inconvenience.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, that's enough rambling for now.   Monica and Kamala's arcs aren't as poorly handled because they are more minor characters, but they also have issues that needed addressing, so I'll explain how they could be fixed later.

The only reason I took the time to type all this out is that this movie had potential.  I didn't hate it.  It's just unfinished, and it feels like someone at Marvel decided to splice it together last second based on a bunch of focus groups and test audiences instead of sitting down and taking the time to tie everything together cohesively and end it well.  It's a real shame because I like all three of the main characters, and they deserved better.",2023-11-10 18:36:09
"Ya know what? It was a fun movie. The most well written? No. But it was funny, action packed and some great crowd pleasing moments and I loved it. It‚Äôs not supposed to be a movie that makes you think and it‚Äôs not trying to be that kind of movie, it‚Äôs a dumb action comedy that KNOWS it‚Äôs a popcorn flick. 

Better than Ant Man? Yes, way better. Not as good as Guardians 3. Secret Invasion? A million times better. 

I definitely understand why people won‚Äôt like it: the humor can be overwhelming at times, Brie Larson IRL, general Marvel fatigue, a lackluster boring generic villain once again (although acting wise I liked Zawe Ashton in the role) 

But the positives outweigh the negatives to me. 

The cameos, the music choices, the fight scenes with them switching powers, it was all great. Kamala stole the show from the first scene. The Flerkittens scene was just‚Ä¶.amazing. Especially using ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù as the song choice. 

One of my personal favorites this year.",2023-11-10 20:43:09

"This movie was so much fun. Iman Vellani, Teyonah Parris and Brie Larson were clearly having a bunch of fun. I laughed a ton during this movie. It seemed like the writers were throwing ideas at the wall, laughing and saying ""that sounds awesome, let's do that,"" then doing that. And it worked. I also like that Kamala's family wasn't just in the movie for that one scene but they were hanging out on the SABER base the entire movie.

Downside is this movie was clearly hacked to bits in the edit bay and the villain is a bit underbaked. It could just as well has been any aggrieved Kree.

How much you liked this movie is probably correlated to how much you liked the twerking scene in She-Hulk. When my girlfriend and I saw the trailer for this before Little Mermaid, she leaned over and said ""I want to see that."" She's not feeling well atm but when she is feeling well enough to go out, I'll take her to see it again.",2023-11-12 02:41:12

"Is there any space to be someone who doesn't like woke messages being forced into movies but also thinks the Brie Larson/Captain Marvel hate has gone WAY overboard? I feel sorry for her tbh. I can't imagine what that's like to go through mentally and I'm impressed by her ability to show up, I'd crumble.

The movie is ok, I'm surprised by people who say it's great and also by the really bad reviews. It's a fine one-time watch. I liked that they injected Captain Marvel with a bit more of a personality in this.

I'm not overly sold on Rambo, I didn't like her in Wandavision and found her to be ""meh"" in this.

Ms Marvel is super enthusiastic which is contagious, not sure I really buy her as a superhero? But that might just be me. Also think her enthusiasm is the complete opposite of how people feel about Marvel nowadays; she's so excited to be there....I'm not sure the general public are anymore, which is a shame but I'm also getting fatigued at this point.

There was no one in my IMAXX theatre when I watched this also, though I did go during the afternoon; it was surreal to be at a Marvel film alone!

>!The mid-credits scene was so bad, when will Marvel kill characters off and let them be killed??! They've been doing this since I think Thor 2? With Loki? And despite lots of people voicing their concerns over it, they continue to do it. So Rambo isn't dead, which takes away ALL the sacrifice and emotional heft of that scene, and also her mum isn't dead (well multi-verse mum but come on....you know what they're doing). In fact they do it so often that when someone dies in a Marvel movie I (and I assume others?) don't feel anything because you're waiting for them to come back. And that CGI'd Beast, woof that was some of the worst I've seen in a while. No thank you.!<

The villain was as forgettable as almost all Marvel movies/shows.

It's not civil war, but it's also not Thor 2, Thor 4, quantmania, ant man 2 etc.",2023-11-10 06:49:05

Awesome. 3 on 1 fight scene? Sweet. Kittens running around? Even better. Best Marvel movie ever? Nope. Worst? Not for me",2023-11-10 23:52:10
"The flerkitten/Memory scene got me to genuinely laugh out loud for the first time since my cat died, so this movie will always have a special place in my heart for that scene alone.

Loved the callback to Kamala‚Äôs show with the animated fan art. Was it Iman or Brie voicing Captain Marvel for those lines? Either way, super cute. And changing into a Captain Marvel shirt before meeting Captain Marvel? Peak fangirl.

The musical planet reminded me of Guardians. If Drax and his whole planet can‚Äôt understand metaphors, makes sense there are planets that go hard the other way. Actually, now I need to see Drax on that planet.

Character-wise, Carol‚Äôs journey reminds me of Thor and Loki. Like Thor, she started her first movie powerful and a little too eager for battle, looked down on Earth culture (until she remembered it was her own, lol), then vowed to become its defender. Like Loki, she was responsible for a near genocidal atrocity and is now atoning. I‚Äôm really curious to see where she goes next - maybe training Kamala and the other Young Avengers?

The Beast cameo was spoiled for me, but that got a big reaction in my theater. Poor Maria has been overshadowed by X-Men cameos twice now.",2023-11-11 05:59:39

"God I'm so glad seeing other people who enjoyed this movie. The only thing I was hoping for was a Spiderman/Shang-chi cameo. Spiderman, because its NYC, and a space craft just fell out of the sky, and Shang-chi, because I believe Kamala's bangles, and Shang's rings are going to be connected somehow.

But that doesn't make me disappointed at all. The mid credit scene was great, I even thought the CGI was pretty good, compared to alot of what we had gotten recently. 

Breaking the movie down, it was really good. And those three piece combos The Marvels were giving to Dar-benn were nasty",2023-11-15 05:43:49
I thought the movie was good and I kind of gave up on marvel movies during this phase.

"This was, fun.  It‚Äôs not one of thr MCU‚Äôs best and the ending felt rushed.  But I had fun watching it.

The plot is nothing special nor is the villain.  But I think it‚Äôs the characters and their interactions that I really quite enjoyed.

The three leads work well together. Carol is being given more of a personality.  Also Iman Vellani is so freaking charming and likable.

I need to see more of Carol and Fury together.  Brie and SLJ just have tons of chemistry together.
 
Speaking of Fury, this film makes Secret Invasion feel even more pointless and mishandled.  Not only does Fury feel like a different (and better) character here than he was in SI.  But a big conceit from SI is directly contradicted here as well.

I can get why some might not like it.  But the singing planet was so comic booky that I really liked it.  And the fact that it was Carol doing it (Brie Larson had a lovely voice) was a cool surprise.

It feels like with the ending the MCU might finally be moving in a real direction again.  We shall see.

Also side note, that Carol/Valkyrie thing is gonna get people talking I suspect (which is what Brie and Tessa Thompson might want actually).",2023-11-10 03:41:37
"I enjoyed it. I love that it featured three female protagonists and a female villain with no romantic subplots! Go Bechdel Test!

That said, I think the script needed a little more time in the oven, if you will. Some parts did feel a bit rushed, the swapping concept started making sense only after I made the leap that it occurred when the characters used powers simultaneously (and even that may be a slightly flawed perception of the mechanic), and the villain could have used a touch more nuance. On the other hand, my partner enjoyed it, which is rare for him lol",2023-11-10 04:36:01

"Ms Marvel and her family were the stars and the heart of the movie. The bad scripts or direction coundnt keep her down

Teyonnah is ok. She had this nerdy black girl personality and did fine. The post credit scene really sets her up in big way. Her missing her mom is very relatable

Captain Marvel just exist in the movie and is the biggest loser of the silly and wacky theme. Her story is too depressing and serious to fit with the silliness and wackiness happening in the movie. While Brie Larson gets more to do like show more emotions. it dont have the energy or just doesnt click. She comes off as less charismatic than Captain marvel and her acting not working. I dont understand what is wrong. She is great in other roles. Its blockbuster roles where seem she lose her entire charm and simply exists.

Also for a movie revolving around Family and friendship, there is no mention Carol's actual family than Maria and Monica. Even after 30 years, She still dont have any new friends other than Valkyrie which again happens off screen


The biggest problem with the movie is its pacing. Their is so much incredble and horrifying things happening but movie never pauses to acknowldge the magnificane or brutality of what is happening. Billions of people dying, cosmic dertuction

Carol litreally powers a dying sun back to life, One of the biggest powerful thing a character has done in live action, yet it is presented in such a casual effortless manner that you never feel the impact. Meanwhile Thor harnessing a tiny star power in Infinity war. the impact it leaves

Simply a sense of cosmic scale, magnificane and horror that you see in Space and superhero movies is completely absent from the movie

I have given upon Carol. Its clear we will not be seeing her much in MCU until Kang dynasty and I dont expect any miracles in that movie which already has so many heros to fix such underdeveloped unrelatable character. Carol just probably became top in the list to die in the movie considering MCU seem to have no idea what the character and personality is even after two movies and movie seem to be doing worse than Morbius

Ultimately, a bad movie with the worst villain till now in MCU with big pacing issues with Iman being the only good part of the movie",2023-11-10 13:47:20

"This was a very mediocre film sprinkled with occasionally decent moments. I had some huge issues with the film (spoilers pertaining to antagonist) >!and a whole laundry list of gripes about the villain's role and methods throughout. Fundamentally, the villain is taking revenge against Carol under the guise of saving her planet. No complaints with this root motivation, which could have been a rich and compelling storyline, but the character we could have gotten and the one we got are worlds apart which becomes apparent as more layers are added. In one scene, during bad-faith negotiations with the Skrull, she outright tells them that she is going to be sucking away their atmosphere, and there's no reaction or mention of this whatsoever until it actually happens, which was mind boggling to me, and seems to be one of many victims of edits and re-writes that were glossed over. Somehow, the portals employed magically know that they\'re intended to suck up air, water, and the sun respectively, despite no discernable difference between them. The antagonist's only combat-relevant abilities appear to be a particularly strong hammer (the wiki from the comics indicates it as being a very capable tool but the movie only shows us a hammer that's kinda strong actually) and a gauntlet that absorbs the Marvel's light based powers ONLY WHEN DIRECTLY BLOCKING THEM. So, somehow, despite KNOWING FULL WELL the entirety of the antagonist's combat prowess after reviewing the first fight (the Marvel's explicitly acknoledge how this works, so they definitely know), they are STILL INCAPABLE of working around a single arm even when attacking as a threefold unit??? Choreography flashy though it may have been I could not take any of the following combat encounters seriously when it's painfully apparent that there's no reason this plotline should have advanced beyond the first planet. And then, at the end, when the villain is ALREADY IN THE PROCESS of accomplishing her final goal of taking Sol, she takes the other gauntlet and kills herself with it for no reason? She knew it would kill her with the energy released, and she was already accomplishing her goal, so what purpose did this serve besides undermining what little character and motivation she actually had? Lastly, throughout the entire film she had an air of extreme urgency leading her to be reckless which was never once explained. !<",2023-11-10 14:35:47

"This film was incredibly poorly edited, it was so choppy. It also probably would've worked better with a set up movie as CM2 and then this third as a team up. The villian was well-acted but needed way more depth to her, and the plot was almost non-existant (again, because of the choppy editing,).



That said, I actually had a blast. It was funny, witty, the dialogue was tight, it made me laugh, and the action was well choreographed. Brie was also a delight.



I'd probably give it a 6.5 or generous 7 out of 10.",2023-11-10 21:57:11
"I enjoyed it (and yes, it was ""fun,"" dammit!). Better than Quantumania or Thor: Love and Thunder, which disappointed me. I guess my expectations are low for most Marvel movies right now, but I wasn't disappointed. I honestly loved the bonkers bits of the singing planet and people-eating kittens, which seem to be polarizing for some. We really don't get enough fun sci-fi movies on other planets, so Marvel's off-Earth movies help scratch that itch for me. For my complaints, the villain was pretty shallow, the editing felt wonky at times, and I think the movie could've been longer. I feel like there should be a TV series or something to cover Captain Marvel's off-screen adventures.",2023-11-10 23:53:48
I have very mixed feelings about this film. The musical planet and cats swallowing everyone was fucking awesome but man the dialogue was bad. Brie Larson gave one of the worst performances I have ever seen in a blockbuster film.,2023-11-10 23:58:18

"The writing was incredibly lazy in some parts. Like Monica suddenly knowing how to close the hole, with some ridiculous technobabble, or how their powers became intertwined for no reason, or how they all had powers related to the EM spectrum

It was good entertainment, though. Sometimes an ultra-powerful superhero can be kind of boring, especially after they've exorcised their own demons. I'm glad they gave Danvers a run for her money

Kinda sad Spectre has already been banished to the Realm Where All Marvel Goes To Die.",2023-11-11 05:28:35
"just saw it and critics were way too harsh on this one IMO. Better than antman3, kamala and her family were great, entanglement fight scenes were really fun and creative with the choreography. Yes the cats eating saber employees was weird, wonder how that came about in the writers room lol.",2023-11-11 23:00:02
"My only complaints are really only about the villain. Had a good flash back motivation but then it all kinds of disappeared after that.

I would have liked to have seen her work with the heroes for once instead of getting another villain death.

Also I wanted to find out more about the hammer, looked inspired by the infinity stone hammer, was hoping they would end up giving some story that it was infused with a portion of the power stones power, either before it's destruction or gathering some of it afterwards somehow, but no it was just the universal weapon and that was it.",2023-11-11 23:06:53

"Marvel needs to drop all these boring people and focus on people that are fucking fun to hang out with

Kamala Khan was a blast to be with, blew Brie larson out of the water. 

I am so excited to have someone who reminds me of the fun and smiles that RDJ/Evans/Heimsworth brought me.

Less Wandas/Stranges/Hawkeyes, more Kamala!!!",2023-11-12 01:36:56
"It was a dumb and fun movie but the only thing I felt it lacked was a solid character driven story around the actual Marvels. 

Like there‚Äôs even a scene where Captain Marvel leaves behind skrulls to die and Kamala argues with her but then it never gets brought back up. 

I wish instead of taking so much screen time going through the motions of the big bad mcu villain they tried to write an interesting plot that‚Äôs more reliant on the three of them working together and dealing with these deeper themes. How about a heist movie? A mystery? Anything different than the villain with a big laser plot we‚Äôve seen so many times. 

Carol is clearly a tough loner control freak who is filled with regret over her not being there for Rambo, and she has a girl who worships her now following her around. This should have created an interesting dynamic but the writers did nothing with it. I never felt anything deep between them, no falling out No coming together for good as a team. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how every MCU film isn‚Äôt treated with as much care as some others. 

I had fun with the film if I didn‚Äôt think about it too much, but I really didn‚Äôt feel much beneath the surface in this movie.",2023-11-12 01:45:32
"First, I liked and was entertained by this movie!

Second, the moment the MCU jumped the shark will specifically be the musical planet scene. WTF

Third, Iman Vellani and Brie Larson chemistry was fantastic. These two are going to be done dirty by Marvel on this film and it stinks because they were great.

Fourth as we‚Äôve been seeing/hearing this movie will not perform well and it stinks because it did some good things (i enjoyed all the scenes with Kamala‚Äôs parents).

Fifth Kelsey Grammar‚Äôs Beast and Binary reveal were awesome. We still didn‚Äôt get a name for Monica Rambeau",2023-11-12 02:13:55
"Loved the movie. Some cool concepts, like I don't think I have seen the gimmick of 3 characters constantly switching places like that before. Kinda hoped the viallin was reedemed and had a more happy ending, since she was literally trying to save her planet. Would have liked if the singing planet soldiers continued singing while fighting. Really liked the final fight. Hope we get to see more of the new avengers soon. Also, I still wonder why Monika couldn't close the hole from the other side.

Have seen people say the plot was confusing but to me it was quite simple. The villain is stealing resources from other planets to rebuild hers after Carol blowed the AI, Monika and Carol have tension, for reason the 3 are constantly switching and in the background Fury and Kamala's family had a wacky adventure.

>!Wonder what they will do with the ending, if it will connect the xmen universe and if this somehow will tie with Deadpool 3!<",2023-11-12 04:20:42
"Aside from the singing and the villain who I think is currently the worst MCU one that I can recall, I enjoyed it a lot.",2023-11-12 05:27:16
"Iman Vellani was the only good thing about this movie and Carol had more personality than before. Some good laughs too. However, I feel like I saw a different movie than everyone here. A forgettable villain who literally gets a single scene of backstory (and literally gets walled in that scene). Captain Marvel feels like she got nerfed to serve the plot. The fight on Song Planet took me out of it as I just saw a set with extras on there. Felt nothing when Rambeau got exiled as she felt pretty underdeveloped as a character and they teased her ten minutes later. 

Similar to the Eternals, where there is a world-ending plot, the Avengers just don't care.",2023-11-12 07:12:41
"The movie was pretty average for me in general.
It felt very rushed with the pacing especially at the start, I guess that they cut out a lot of scenes to cut down the run time, or at least it felt like it. 

A few moments that gave me pause- 

Bar-Denn just disintegrated before their eyes, so they give the same quantum band to Ms Marvel and then tell her to direct an equivalent amount of energy to Monica? This seemed weird to me, like given the context, I would have expected her to have issues or something, as she is kind of just human, I was thinking at least Captain Marvel would have to do it as she is more resilient.

And then Captain Marvel just leaves Ms Marvel to travel home alone on the ship? A teenager? Was reigniting the sun SO IMPORTANT she couldn‚Äôt spend a little time to actually make sure she doesn‚Äôt leave her high and dry? She shouldn‚Äôt even really know if she actually has the power to do this, and it might be dangerous to her, surely, she kind of does it so nonchalantly and quickly, with no zoom in of her even struggling, it kind of makes the whole thing weird like ‚Äúoh, I kind of forgot I was this powerful and could help you easily‚Äù.

And after the quantum bands were floating in space, wasn‚Äôt there a giant hand that scooped them up? Weren‚Äôt we under the impression that the bangles were generating the hard light? That needed some kind of explanation somewhere.

Where were the quantum bands by the last scene? I don‚Äôt think I saw both bangles on Kamala, and I very much doubt they would let her keep both, given their power together, but it was a central plot point to the movie, and they just don‚Äôt even make a single scene (post credits would be fine) where they tell us where the bands are? Seems really crazy to me that they‚Äôd overlook it.

I‚Äôm not sure I really understood why they needed to evacuate the Saber base. I thought that it was those flerken eggs somehow damaging things, but I guess it wasn‚Äôt, maybe it was something related to the Kree attacking them, was a bit confused on the exact cause as they blurred the flerken egg situation in there.

Think the whole end boss fight ended up a bit meh for me in general. People get whacked around like pinballs a little, but I think that Ms Marvel isn‚Äôt really at the same level as the other two, like anyone toe to toeing with Captain Marvel, a stray shot should be completely pancaking Ms Marvel as she‚Äôs just a human if she doesn‚Äôt directly block a shot with her hard light projection. And Bar-Denn taking all these attacks then getting pinned down by rubble just seemed a bit anti-climactic too. Either they‚Äôre tough or they‚Äôre not, really, seems a bit off-putting to have it both ways like that, just for plot purposes.

Even nearer to the start of the movie, did we seriously see Captain Marvel fly off, and then somehow did we HEAR Ms Marvel scream as they swapped, and then somehow they heard that at the ground and Monica had enough time to fly up and try to rescue her? I don‚Äôt think sound travels anywhere near that fast‚Ä¶ and tbh the whole switching thing, if it was actually happening then wouldn‚Äôt Captain Marvel be intelligent enough to maybe not go into space and risk killing off Ms Marvel who can‚Äôt actually breathe in space?? Tbh the scene where Ms Marvel was in space with the space suit felt a bit dodgy in general, as the suit should have really traveled with Monica too, it‚Äôs not like they change clothes every time they switch‚Ä¶ and Monica can survive in space apparently as she closed the rip, so I don‚Äôt even know why she was really in the clunky space suit to begin with‚Ä¶

Beyond all that, there were some funny jokes, the fight scene at Kamala‚Äôs house was fun, the general premise if you ignore plot-holes, wasn‚Äôt too bad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd put the whole thing on the lower end of average. Marvel movies do require you to suspend your disbelief a little, but I think this one did it more than I expected to, where I just thought it was poorly planned and executed.",2023-11-12 08:29:12
"I liked it but it is a mess. It‚Äôs not complete horseshit like Ant Man 3 by failing as drama and comedy. This is fluffy but fun. Sometimes it‚Äôs a little annoying, I think Iman Vellani‚Äôs character is supremely endearing but may need allergy meds lol. Very nasally.

Still like that X-men is coming but this must‚Äôve been a quick reshoot given how shoddy Beast looks.",2023-11-12 14:32:33

"I‚Äôm a bit confused about the swapping places. They are swapping between 3 people. So if Ms Marvel uses her power, how is it decided if captain marvel or Monica takes her spot? Is it just completely random?

"I liked some of the ideas, and I liked some of the scenes, and I liked some of the performances, but the movie felt thin, and it could‚Äôve used another script pass from the writers. 

Also, Samuel L Jackson looks old. Age has caught up to him. Secret Invasion was so bad it affected this movie. Ms Marvel was so bad it affected this movie (although Vellani is not the problem).",2023-11-13 04:30:45

"The movie was pretty fun. I enjoyed most of the interactions between the Marvels, Flerken usage was nice and there were some nice skits. Don't care much about the post-credit but the last scene was cool.

But man the story was bad, >!I spent the whole time wondering why they didn't just go the Hala since they knew it was about the Kree, instead of failing at 2 rescues chasing after the vilain (I hope the prince divorce Carol btw). It's also weird that they try to have an emotional moment about Rambeau closing the gate when she clearly announced she would do it, it's like in Interstellar when they're surprised that time goes slow in the planet where time goes slow...!<

Also they need to stop relying so much on physical confrontation when they have strong characters. it shouldn't take them 5min to take down 2 Krees, and the villain should at least have some bruises after being triple-punch a couple times. Keep the brawls and luchador wrestling for non-powered heroes.",2023-11-14 20:39:50
"A lot better than I thought m, the best thing in the film was carol and khamala. Monica was decent. My main complaint is the villain, she kinda just sucked and I don‚Äôt think there were enough scenes between her and carol. And of course the cgi, it was horrid but it wasn‚Äôt great either. Everything else ranges from a nitpick to decent . 

I‚Äôd give this like a 6 or 7/10",2023-11-14 21:24:48
"This is the weirdest film I've had to think about: it certainly was undercooked but had a bunch of good moments throughout.

For starters, I loved the weird sense of humor. Marvel basically remade the Cats movie but did it better. And the action did seem serviceable for the most part. Iman was also terrific.

But the movie is severly underwritten. The catharsis moments go by so quickly (""hey I think was responsible for wiping out the Kree."" ""It's ok we're family"" so I guess we're in a Fast movie now?). And there is just way too much exposition and telling the audience/ not showing. I'm not really sure why people think this is an editing problem when it's clearly the script.

I also think that the villain was not utilized well. Her underlying motivation is certainly sympathetic (as an aside, I think that Jeremy Jahms completely whiffed on his review of the movie since it was hard to follow a lot of the time what exactly he disliked; this was probably the biggest thing I disagreed with him about, I think there's a bit more depth to the antagonist than female Ronan the Accuser). But I don't think that her grudge with Captain Marvel is leveraged well.

Overall, not the worst of the MCU movies (unlike this movie, Antman 3 was unredeemable) and probably needed some more time in the oven. Putting more character moments and more weirdness would have definitely made this a good movie.",2023-11-15 03:37:03
"I've seen every Marvel film after Endgame and this is the only one I liked from start-to-finish. Not amazing, but just a simple fun film. I haven't seen any of the shows and seemed to  understand it OK overall.

It's a shame it's doing poorly. I didn't even know it came out last week.

I think Marvel fumbled this one bad. Churning out so many mediocre films has caused MCU fatigue for the audience. This movie is feeling the consequences of it and has to suffer.",2023-11-19 04:41:01
"The movie was as long as a light French comedy you watch on a Sunday afternoon. I feel like a good 30-50 minutes were lost in editing room.

The villain is another generic villain you will forget at the end of the credits. They tried to raise the stakes by having the villain try to steal our sun. I never felt a threat. There was barely a solar flare-like shown on screen for 2 seconds to evidence the process had started then POOF she dead.

I don't understand why Monica had to be on the other side to close the gate. Well of course it's a cheap shortcut to get her into the X-Men Universe. Lazy writing. And her mum being an X-Men ? The exact person she wakes up to so we have a fake cliffhanger ? And how did she went from space to the X-Men compound ?

Also, where was Jude Law character ?

And Kamala rushing (ALONE AND ON HER OWN ?) to Kate Bishop in order to form Young Avengers. Cringy. 

I never miss Marvel content because I consider series and movies the perfect pop corn content. But many disappointments since Endgame. The Marvels is one of them. Butchered in the editing room I guess.",2024-01-17 02:59:31

And it might be true that the movie failed in so many ways to be a decent product, but still, why do people have such joy in watching this movie amongst others, fail? And why cannot be criticized in a creative and constructive way instead of doing it for the sake of meanness?",2023-11-13 18:14:40

"I don't know that I understand anymore. We're firmly in the phase of the hot thing is to hate on Marvel movies and shows. I think the critics feed on this and proactively incorporate that narrative into their reviews ('fatigue', too much, 'bad CGI', blah blah blah).

I really liked this movie. It was funny, it was colorful, it had great soundtrack choices, it had a plot that I haven't seen in the comics, and it had really inventive material (the swapping places fight choreography, the singing planet, the escape from SABER, the way the climax gives a plausible and the most overt setup for the Multiverse Saga to date, the setup of Kamala taking the Nick Fury role for Champions/Young Avengers, etc.).
Yes, the villain is throwaway. That's intentional. You can't have Thanos or Kang in every movie. Yes, it seems to ignore 'Secret Invasion' (which seems wise at this point).

But this is an enjoyable movie with great hero characters that was well executed. I don't get why so many people won't accept that opinion, particularly those that seemingly haven't seen it. I often click off of Reddit wondering about how awful it must be to need to dislike everything all the time.",2023-11-11 21:00:55

"Let me preface this by saying I'm one of those people that didn't really like Captain Marvel -- both the movie and the actress playing her. I've been seeing people crap on this movie ahead of time for months now, and was prepared as I walked in to do the same. I hoped I would be proven wrong, though.  
  
Well, it turns out that I was. From start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. While the majority of it took place in space, Carol Danvers seemed much more humanized here. Kamala was a lot of fun, too (reminded me a bit of ‚Äúsilly Barry‚Äù in The Flash from earlier this year). Captain Marvel had an opponent that could actually take on her on even footing, too ‚Äî it took three Marvels to take her down. There was no shoehorned scene of Carol emasculating some hillbilly guy or anything to that effect. It was just three great superheroes (and maybe a cat or two) doing their thing.   

In addition to what I felt was a good standalone story, we also got good backstory on Monica Rambeau and even more on Carol. And let me also say that I‚Äôm NOT someone that‚Äôs watched ANY of the Disney Plus stuff, but I still mostly followed along and enjoyed myself.   

This all tells me that Disney‚Äôs marketing for this film has been atrocious. I never would have thought this movie would come together the way it did and leave me saying ‚ÄúWow, this was one of the better superhero films of the whole year‚Äù from any promotional material behind it. Between Ant-Man and Guardians 3 from this year from Marvel, I place this in between, only because GotG3 had a certain finality of a whole trilogy to it with all of its characters and handled that part so well. Otherwise, though, this is up there with it.  

All in all, it was a lot of fun to me! Some silly parts, sure, but that‚Äôs all part of the fun of it. I actually thought the musical planet was a fun distraction and a good way to showcase another side of Carol. And the cat-thing was silly, but also was a nice payoff to an ongoing b-plot as well. 

All in all, I quite enjoyed this, even though I most certainly did not expect to do so!",2023-11-10 04:16:33

"I liked it. Not the best Marvel movie but far from the worst. Ms. Marvel is definitely the highlight.

I honestly don't understand all of the negative buzz. I think the most basic problems are that it's not called Captain Marvel 2 & a lot of people were turned off after two ""unknown"" characters were featured so heavily in the trailers. The Disney+ shows feel like homework to so many casual fans & if you want them to pay to see a movie, this isn't the way to do it.",2023-11-10 06:43:11
"Some of the placement swapping editing was terrible especially in that first fight. 

I think the movie needed about ten or so more minutes. Add some quick shots to smooth out the teleportation and make it followable and maybe some quick lines of dialog to build up Danvers' and the villian's animosity and that Danvers hates and is ashamed of the 'Annihilator' title.

This movie isn't perfect but deserves more credit than the early reviews scores.

If I'm reading [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar-Benn) correctly the villain had only two comic appearances. Might explain why she felt underdeveloped.",2023-11-10 07:10:36

Is it some brilliant piece of cinema? Oh lordy no. 

But it was fun and got a few really good laughs out of me. Loved the Marvels themselves but I will say I felt nothing for the villain. She had no real buildup or character to make me care about her or her motives. Climax felt a bit rushed.

But it was a really fun movie and worth seeing on the big screen and overpayin for food and goofing off with my buddy. Plus the mid-credits scene....Hooooooooo boy.",2023-11-15 04:59:49

But we don't know which planets are dear to Captain Marvel because we know nothing about her life in space. I guess we know she's friends with the green painted aliens because of the first movie, but we've never seen her visit their new planet. I feel like they get shafted in this movie like oh yeah sorry we couldn't save 90% of your population, go with Valkyrie.

The movie felt underwritten like they were just checking boxes to make another Marvel movie. It was Kamala's first time in space and there's not any moment where she marvels at the sights. I thought it was lazy how they used the thought exploration headset to show us Captain Marvel's inner conflicts. I do like that they gave Carol more development, but I still think they could have done more with her. It even felt cheap for a $200 million movie.

"It‚Äôs one thing to be getting tired of the MCU house style, which I admittedly am, but it‚Äôs another entirely for that house style to be looking cheaper and cheaper as the series goes on.

I‚Äôm well aware how brutal these projects are for effects teams, which isn‚Äôt helping anything, but that‚Äôs not the only factor behind why they feel poorly made. The editing is weird and choppy. The music stinks. The action feels like they had half a day to rehearse. All dialogue scenes are shot exactly the same way, so much with people standing around with fake backgrounds that are barely better than the most egregious exposition dialogue scenes from the Star Wars prequels.

I like these characters. I want these movies to be good. James Gunn managed to make a great one amid all this, and Raimi got a few of his own touches in, but I‚Äôm reaching a breaking point with how poor the production look and feel is. It wasn‚Äôt tolerable with the DC projects and it‚Äôs getting really old here.

"I rate it 2 1/2 stars, which is pretty good for a superhero flick.  
I saw it last night. Fun, cosmic action. In typical Nia DaCosta fashion, it feels like there was far more story planned than what we get.  
It's a deeply unserious movie, but it never goes as far into being a cartoon as Love and Thunder did. It maintains a solid superhero ethos throughout and doesn't veer into sitcom.  
I personally love a cosmic hero, so I'm biased here -- but there was a moment when Captain Marvel's energy blasts sounded like a choir of angels singing. 

Some very trippy visuals, which I particularly enjoyed.

If you're watching these movies for a deep plot, this will be a miss for you. If you want a solid, light superhero flick with some excellent characters, Marvels is your flick.

I dunno why this movie is getting the backlash it is. I was smiling the entire time. Fun time. Not top tier Marvel but no where near bottom tier. The three actresses killed it and it‚Äôs a shame this movie‚Äôs performance is likely gonna affect our future with them.,2023-11-11 15:37:52
So lots of hate for this movie even from critics I kind of respected. I simply just don't see it this movie is fine and an awesome no but most marvel movies are not. Hell most movies are not but the idea that this is a disaster is just wrong-headed. I also think a lot will be blamed about weakness and black people and this and that but the reality is Disney did not promote this movie at all they should have pushed it until the strike was over and they could have done a real marketing campaign.,2023-11-11 18:18:35
"7/10 

Super messy ending but a good mid to low tier MCU movie. Not much competition in Phase 5, so a second place behind GotG3

I loved the team up and their training montage. It's a shame they didn't actually learn to fight the villain using those powers. Good chemistry, although a bit less fangirling would have been ok, too. 

Cool planets, although they felt smaller than usual

Fury and the Khan's had no point lol 

Really happy Captain Marvel finally gets to be likeable and honest. Honestly wish she'd show up more often now but she is too powerful. 

Movie was quite short, too.",2023-11-11 21:58:02

But it's clear to see so much was lost in editting. I'm disappointed thheg really glossed over the fact Carol was responsible for the death of a planet and civilisation. Like how Kamala would see not everything a hero does is good, and add some more conflict to that revelation",2023-11-12 04:50:45
Went into the movie knowing nothing about what I would see‚Ä¶..it reminded me of a Marvel universe meshed with a fan girl Bollywood theme that added a dash of a Game of Thrones vigilante with cats that saved space.

I think this is a really good movie for general audiences.   
Those who aren't film buffs, or MCU followers; Instead, if you just want a fun random sci-fi space adventure that you can take the kids to, this is the one.   


And I stress... its fun! 

I had so much fun with this, waaay more than quantumania or Love and Thunder.   
And I don't even like Captain Marvel as much.

  
For the negatives, its the obvious, the plot is decent, the CGI is meh, the characters are verrry disconnect (Fury is nothing like his character in secret invasion), the actors are all right (Brie Larson has just one emotion throughout)

&#x200B;

But what saves the movie for me is Iman vellanis Ms Marvel ( and her whole family), the post credits scenes and just the sheer-light-heartedness of it all.   


I think this is just you very average marvel film, and I mean that in a good way. If you don't think too much about the plot or the nitpicks, and just let yourself enjoy it, you really will have a good time. The hijinks and comedy were sooo welcomed!

The house fight scene in particular was making use of every object in the room, which I love to see.

"Alright so we can all agree this was easily the weakest movie marvel villain. Like ol girl was the most forgettable antagonist I‚Äôve seen tbh. So boring and a weak motivation. This was really just an excuse to get Carole, Monica and Kamala together and honestly, I‚Äôm ok with that. I loved the movie lmao. All the negative pre screening ratings and the tweets etc etc made this out to be the worst thing ever.

It‚Äôs a pretty weak story, but the story is basically a conduit through which Carole and Monica rekindle their relationship and Kamala comes into her own. She honestly carried the movie. Her actress is so good and I loved her family in this one. Felt like a direct continuation of the Disney + series which was nice.

But speaking of Disney + series. I feel like this made Secret invasion pointless lol. Like did Fury feel no shame for basically causing all of this? Not even a mention of what had happened before with the skrulls.

I loved the comedy in this one too. Brie Larson seems to have got much more comfortable in this role and captain Marvel really feels an actual person for once. Samuel is being allowed to be more of himself in his role as fury and I‚Äôm loving it. We saw that in secret invasion and it‚Äôs continued into this.

Now one question I have with the movie is Kamala using both bangles. They didn‚Äôt explain this, but I‚Äôm assuming she can use both because she‚Äôs a mutant as well? Or because her grandmother‚Äôs people are from another dimension? Which also raises the question of how they got split in multiple dimensions?

That post credits scene!! Man I LOVE going to the cinema with other comic fans, the collective gasp everyone let out at seeing Beast at the end was so damn cool. I kinda hate that he‚Äôs CGI, but hopefully by the time secret wars comes around they‚Äôll have fixed that. It‚Äôs so cool to see him in the MCU üò© this‚Äôll set up the X-Men in secret wars and it‚Äôs fitting it happens in a movie with Ms.Marvel since she‚Äôs our first confirmed mutant(technically scarlet witch and quicksilver were.. but that‚Äôs another story)

Well paced, the comedic moments worked well and never went on so long as to get old, like could‚Äôve easily happened with the singing planet, and the serious moments were allowed to play out without being undercut by dumb jokes.

Didn‚Äôt like a couple things. The flerken kitten eating scene was fun, but i would‚Äôve rather had more about the aftermath of the water being taken from the singing planet. I also thought Carol reigniting hala‚Äôs sun at the end should‚Äôve seemed a bit more difficult.

Yes, the movie isnt well done technically, the story is bad(which Marvel Story was good i might ask) and the overall tone is aimed at 10year old girls.

I was in that movie with my daughter and she had a blast. It was really the best time i had all year, just because he kept laughing and cheering(for Tony, our RL cat, not the marvels btw). Ofc i would have hated the movie too, i am a 40year old Nerd. But the target audience loved it.
And there are even a few fighting bites in the beginning, which were legit good.


The question ofc is, why Marvel tries to make movies for non-marvel-fans, while they are in so much debt to all of you guys. But for my little girl this was great. She loved it.",2023-11-11 20:50:26

One thing didn't didn't work much for me was Dar Ben? Wth kinda villain name is that. Furthermore the villain being like a wannabe Ronan. I get it. Kree empire and what not but she was kinda lame for a super villain. Lame only because it seems as a Ronan rehash.

Another annoyance is Dar Ben is doing some pretty catastrophic stuff. Siphoning atmosphere and then a sea. Singing planet is gone now?

Isn't that when we need a crossover, Guardians of the Galaxy, that little girl who seems to have Marvel abilities. Thor or Valkerie? Coming to help. I mean Dar Ben was going to Syphon the sun.

Then with the fabric rip, at least bring in Doctor Strange. He dealt with it twice already. Significantly.

"I love superhero movies, but a movie still has to be good. I'm not a big MCU fan because I think most of their movies are below average. Especially now days with all the time travel/multiverse stuff. I can barely understand any of it. It's too much, and it's not an enjoyable storyline. I don't want to have to remember what happened 5 movies ago to understand what's happening in the current movie. And I hate watching a movie that's just a filler for something in the future. I hate movies that can't stand on their own feet.

Brie Larson is insufferable. Hated by the right, and left, and everyone in-between. She has a shit personality. And she allegedly wants to quit because she can't handle the backlash (rolls eyes). I don't give a shit what anyone's beliefs are. I know what my beliefs are, and I live my REAL life that way. I'm just here to watch a good movie. When I say movie, I mean movie. Left, right, middle, I don't care. As long as it's not some political advertisement. So, when it comes to movies, I think Brie Larson is a great actress. I like her style as an actress, and is very pleasing to the eye. But her shit personally does show up all over her face.

In saying all of this, I thought this movie was very good. Iman Vellani is as cute as can be. You can't not love her, and her family. Teyonah Parris is a very strong actress, very dimensional, and very likeable. Brie Larson was surprisingly cute, charming, and funny. I don't know if they purposely made her that way, or if it's her, or a combination of both, but it worked.

This movie stood on it's feet. Very entertaining. The only thing that bothered me was all the ""Auntie Carole"" stuff. I give this movie a solid B+. This is coming from a 40+ year old white dude.",2023-11-12 12:53:08

"***I think people are missing the point about Dar-Benn. She isn‚Äôt the actual villain in THE MARVELS. It‚Äôs Captain Marvel.***

Let me explain.

So I‚Äôve just watched the absolute masterpiece that is LOKI‚Äôs season 2 finale. I‚Äôve just came back from a 3 hours road and earlier tonight, I‚Äôve watched The Marvels for a second time, this time on IMAX 2D and more ready to digest the film. It‚Äôs something I always have done to MCU films: a second watch to have a better grasp of it, and then something dawned and I really need to talk about this because I think people are missing a massive point from THE MARVELS:

Dar-Benn isn‚Äôt this film‚Äôs *actual* villain. The villain in THE MARVELS is no one other but Carol Danvers, prodigal child of the Milky Way, Captain Marvel and‚Ä¶ *the annihilator*.  That‚Äôs the plot twist. Allow me to explain, before the Carol Corps come after me: one of the things most often criticized about The Marvels is that the villain is forgettable. Here is the thing, Dar-Benn was just a cypher in the comics, just like she is just a cypher in this film. She isn‚Äôt the actual villain of the film, she is the antagonist there to make the superheroines look cool with their entangled powers yes, but she is there much more to represent what Carol Danvers did after the CAPTAIN MARVEL film and how ashamed she is of it than anything else. 

Without diving too much deep in the real world allegories of the first CAPTAIN MARVEL film, it‚Äôs clear that underneath the personal stakes for Carol Danvers, there is a not so thinly veiled story about oppressors (Kree) and oppressed (Skrulls). That film ends with Carol Danvers sending Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) back to Hala, the home world of the Kree‚Äôs Empire with a very clear and sound message: ""*Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I‚Äôm coming to end it. The war. The lies. All of it.*"" And she did put an end to the Supreme Intelligence like it was shown on THE MARVELS. But that resulted in a Kree civil war and without the Supreme Intelligence to rule over the Kree, Hala was perishing. Hala was becoming uninhabitable, and Dar-Benn‚Äôs true purpose in the film as the Supremor, leader of the now fractured Hala‚Äôs empire was to represent Captain Marvel‚Äôs shame. Punching her way out a complex conflict didn‚Äôt help, and while one could say that Dar-Benn is a zealot that would cross the Skrulls anyway, the film goes out of its way to show that Dar-Benn did reach out to the Skrull‚Äôs refugee leader trying to arrange a peace treaty between the two people.

THE MARVELS is at a personal level about Captain Marvel learning to allow people to get close to her yes, a girl that she helped raise that idolized her that ended up becoming her woman by her own tragic life trials - Monica Rambeau - and a new girl that completely idolized her and thought she could absolutely do no wrong - Kamala Khan. But it is at a macro level about white savior syndrome, and how ashamed Carol was that in fact she couldn‚Äôt alone bring peace to the Kree-Skull conflict, after all. In fact, even if with good intentions, even if it was trying to free galaxies from the Kree Empire‚Äôs ruthless domain, the home world of the Kree Empire was dying. Monica is the one realizing that what Dar-Benn was asking for *is* fair, Captain Marvel has the power to reignite the sun, and that‚Äôs the core of THE MARVELS, that‚Äôs the moment that Captain Marvel starts to redeem herself.

I think one big massive mistake that fans of the superhero genre have is that they are used to easy black and white solutions. Yes, the Kree Empire was an evil force in the galaxy. Yes, Captain Marvel had to do something about their rule, but what this film shows - similar like Zemo showed in Captain America: Civil War - is that underneath the legend of the Captain Marvel, the legendary superhero of Earth that Monica calls aunt Carol, Kamala idolizes or the Kree from Hala call *the anihilator*, there is an woman, trying to do the best she can with the insane amount of power she has, but she doesn‚Äôt  need to fight her battles alone,  and wars between two different civilizations or people can‚Äôt be ended by simply punching hard. 

Dar-Benn could have been literally any other Kree, that‚Äôs her point in this particular story. She isn‚Äôt there to be a memorable villain, she is the consequence of Captain Marvel trying to end with the war and the lies like she promised by the end of the first film. Could this film being better?I think so. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a perfect film by any means, I think it‚Äôs flawed but I think Marvel‚Äôs actual secret sauce is how human this larger than life stories are, how flawed the very best, most powerful and arguably some of the most inspiring of them can be. I came out from the film yesterday after my first watch thinking THE MARVELS didn‚Äôt surpass the CAPTAIN MARVEL film, but the more I think about it, more I think that Nia DaCosta and the screenwriters actually told a very bold Marvel story. You don‚Äôt win an war by radicalizing more people, and I think both CAPTAIN MARVEL and THE MARVELS use the rich Marvel Comics mythology to tell a story that seems kinda needed these days: wars aren‚Äôt ended by radicalizing more and more people, and while my head is beaming with what THE MARVELS means to the MCU‚Äôs future ‚Äî (1) give me the Young Avengers right NOW; (2) did parallel Earth Binary lost her memories to Rogue like the comics and that‚Äôs why Beast and Xavier were the ones she was hanging out? (3) what are the consequences of Captain Marvel‚Äôs redemption reigniting Hala‚Äôs sun, if any? Sure, she is next to Wanda and Thor the most powerful Avenger, but there is a *lot* of radiation in the sun, doesn‚Äôt it? Please tell me they aren‚Äôt going *there* and don‚Äôt even start with what LOKI sets up with that *glorious* season finale ‚Äî but I love when Marvel tackles the morality of their superhero stories. It might fly under the radar a lot, but I think there is a lot of subtext there worthy to explore and talk about beyond talking about ‚Äòsuperheroes defeat big bad‚Äô.",2023-11-10 09:21:46

"Iman Vellani's Kamala is the best part of the movie, her charm and presence is great. But I stand by that she had absolutely no reason to be in the movie sadly. The entanglement mechanics they made is the only reason to include her and the only reason the movie is as long as it is considering just how weak the villain is, both powerset-wise and also motivation-wise. The chemistry they had on the ship really is great though and the entangled fights are also pretty great. Also, there's already a glimmer of great in Brie Larson's Carol Danvers. Sadly the movie got bogged down by everything else. I would love for this movie to be solely focused on Carol's action on Hala and the consequences it brings to create someone like Dar-Benn and her connection to Monica that in this movie felt rashly resolved. The Khan family was charming and great on the house scene, they don't need to be on the spaceship. The flerken storyline could've been used for other more in-depth development of Carol. This Nick Fury might as well be from another universe because holy shit, did they not at least watch Secret Invasion? How jarring. The end scene and the mid-credit scene are pretty great, but they're not worth going to the cinema for. All in all, the runtime's too short, the editing is a mess, the character arcs and development got cut short for unnecessary subplots, and the villain is an all-timer bottom-tier MCU villain. Iman Vellani is a great addition, the three main characters' dynamic is pretty good, and the switching places action sequences are great. 6/10. Wait for disney+",2023-11-10 15:19:56
"I thought there were some interesting ideas that they introduced, but then didn't do much with them.

1. Monica's feeling of abandonment by Carol when she was the only ""family"" that Monica had left.
2. A ""never meet your heroes"" type of thing with Kamala where she realizes that Carol isn't the person from her fantasies. Kamala is a young girl who idolizes Carol, so it could've even been an interesting parallel to Monica, another young girl who idolized Carol but was failed by her. Could've had overall celebrity worship/parasocial relationship commentary as well. 
3. Carol's feelings of isolation since it seems like her job was basically just to hang around in deep space by herself waiting for people who need her help on whatever random planet, and the antisocial behavior that comes with it which would further her issues with Monica and Kamala.
4. All of those things would set Carol up as a very flawed hero which would've been interesting since they intended her to be one of the big new faces of the franchise post-Iron Man/Captain America/Thor.

I know that this is a superhero movie, and an MCU one at that, so maybe they can't go super deep into the character drama stuff at risk of turning off the people who want to see action, but if they explored those things a lot further it could've even made a weak villain not be that big of an issue.

But since they just kind of touched on those things and didn't really explore them at all, they had the weakest villain in MCU history, the pacing was really weird, and it seemed like three different movies they spliced together, overall it was just pretty bad.",2023-11-10 16:51:35

"I have seen all the MCU movies. Loki season 1 is the only Disney Marvel series I have seen. It finally showed.

Good thing I do follow TV/Movies news and knew who was Kamala Khan to get some pointers even though I don't quite know her abilities and psychology. And they made it clear enough that Monica Rambeau was Carol Danvers's friend little daughter from the first movie. However, she now is working in space with Nick Fury and has powers. How, why, what ? Who cares. And earthlings have upgraded from helicarriers to space spation at some point.

And the Skree/Krulls ? You better remember some parts of the quite forgettable first Captain Marvel movies to know who are those aliens, why they don't like each other, what they are capable to do. And don't wonder why the Kree (Skrulls ? a bit of interchangeable names there..) are very different morphotypes.

Really seem like this is the most reliant on series dump info we got in the whole MCU.

**

Apart that ? Well, it was entertaining enough for the 100 minutes I was there. Then quite forgettable in the foreseeable future. Brie Larson was good. Iman Vellani was endearing. The Khan family was the comic relief. Nick Fury was there. The villain lady will go right into the ""Forgot what was that MCU villain"".",2023-11-11 20:39:16
"As a huge Marvel fan, I wasn't too big of a fan of this movie. I think there are some character moments and concepts that start to come in and then stop to move the plot forward fast. Because of that, it seemed like it went all over the place, even with its tone. There were a lot of jokes that didn't land for me that well (although I thought the flerken scene and the Khans were hilarious). And, the villain, while the concept of her backstory was interesting, didn't develop enough.

That being said, I still loved the chemistry of the three main characters. All them were great. I liked Brie Larson's Carol Danvers more here than the previous movies, she was charming. Teyonah Paris did great and I liked her arc with Brie, although I wish it was resolved a little better. And, Iman Vellani really carried this movie for me for sure. She's the heart and soul of this thing.",2023-11-11 21:57:36

"Watched Jeremy Jahns tear this movie apart beforehand and went in with low expectations - honestly not that bad, 6.5/10.

Felt like a Phase 2 MCU movie, like not in a bad way. A relatively organic continuation of the story (well, stories in this case) that was both self-contained and had massive implications at the same time. 

The first act was really entertaining, 2nd started to fade a bit, third was choppy and fell kinda flat for me. 

However not once was I bored (a la Eternals), annoyed at the jokes (a la Thor 4) or confused as to what's going on (a la Quantumania). 

Struggling to call the villain ""MCU's worst"" because absolutely nobody will remember her at all. Her motivation (and plan) was pretty strong though, don't get the criticism of ""it's literally Spaceballs"".

I'm a little disappointed in Nick Fury being reduced to ""quippy bossman"" these last few movies. He used to be a strong presence, now not so much.

"Just saw it. I'm a GenX Italian/Irish american. I think I'm in the demographic that's supposed to be angry at this movie or something by what I've seen on youtube, my feed with thumbnail after thumbnail of angry dudes telling me it's another marvel abomination.

I enjoyed the hell out of The Marvels.

It was a rare Marvel film going in I didn't have a strong notion what to expect as far overall tone, aside from what previews suggested. Black Panther 2 was understandably similar in that regard. I think a rough assessment of the *feel* of The Marvels would be like some Ms Marvel series germinated with Thor Ragnarok, with essence of Spiderman & Guardians of the Galaxy mixed in.

I think Marvel struck gold with the kid playing Kamala Khan, and the character translated to film better then I'd guessed.  The way she's portrayed is hilarious and fun, with similar energy to spiderman, but KK's distinct personality shining really bright. The action scenes with her were solid too. 


IDK, it's weird. It's maybe the 3rd or 4th Marvel film I've really enjoyed over the last couple of years that was dragged and vilified and Marvel roasted over by this new cottage industry of Marvel hating nerd reviewers, who weirdly treat each Marvel release like a Superbowl or something because their channels are finally going to get some views when the upload their oddly celebratory scathing take-downs of the new worst Marvel film ever.  Like celebrating box office results. That's seems kind of a new & strange thing. Yes, people have always loved a good dumpster fire to point & laugh at, but this new bred of ""critic"" seem to be trying spark the fires themselves with ill-will.


With Thor 4, Doctor Strange 2, and Ant Man 3, I think I got something close to what I was expecting. Like I ordered a pepperoni pizza & got a pepperoni pizza. I enjoyed them about as equally as their franchise's predecessors. Black Panther 2 was something different but had it's own merits & problems. I don't see some big quality shift in the films. Spiderman 3, to me, was pretty much of the same ilk as the above, but the haters didn't stew on that one so much, too much box office I guess.  Guardians 3 was one I'd rank higher because Gunn controlling each film to a greater degree let him put some signature funk on his trilogy closer.

I think that the turns of these former Marvel fans to people who now really dislike Marvel has to be more about what's going on inside the viewer rather than much anything Marvel has done. I really don't think that the films have changed drastically.",2023-12-14 08:16:23

"There's many issues with this movie. But I think it actually outright can't exist and be coherent with the MCU. Like how does it remotely work with the universe established in Guardians 1? How were the Kree able to be at war with Xandar or anything else if they were utterly broken as a society after a civil war, their supreme intelligence destroyed for decades, their sun extinguished, home world uninhabitable, etc? Ronan got the power stone and was worried about Xandar instead of...going after Captain Marvel? Marvel really has let itself go in terms of trying to be consistent within its own universe.

The movie wasn't great. It might have been better than the first Captain Marvel. But it doesn't feel like they managed to rise much above it.

Kind of fitting having Kamala going around doing the Nick Fury thing in the post credit...since Nick hasn't felt like Nick Fury in years. They really don't know what to do with that guy anymore.

It's all good if people had a good time with this. The only thing I hope from people is avoiding the lazy argument that people didn't get it. People can absolutely get something you like...and simply not enjoy it.",2023-12-26 17:21:53
"I think this film was middling.

Some interesting fight sequences using the gimmick of ""switching"" each character mid-fight. The interactions between the main characters worked for me for the most part and I don't think there was an oversaturation of quipping during fights.

Unfortunately the villain, whilst having some valid motivation, was utterly forgettable. The film had some really strange pacing at times, not sure if big chunks got cut out, the weird break in pace for a musical number seemed unnecessary. Also, MCU films are starting to look really ugly, I dunno if it's unfinished CGI or the lack of practical sets, but it's not good. 

I think the films biggest crime is being yet another completely forgettable entry into the MCU, but on it's own, it isn't a bad film. A pretty standard superhero flick, that you might have seen in earlier phases.

- It can't be this goofy the whole way, it needs to conform to the generic marvel tone. (Ironically, this movie would have been perfect for Taika, going off the plot vs how he does movies)
- It has to be a multiverse story

Change two things about this and it's way better.

- The portals aren't causing an incursion. It's just destabilising the jump network and if they don't stop her, this will cripple countless space-age civilizations because they're no longer able to communicate or do logistics etc.

- Dar-Benn takes the offer to fix Hala's sun. Because killing the last leader is *what fucked up Hala last time by causing the war*. They close the hole via Monica's powers, and then we get a scene above Hala after Carol fixes the sun, where on Carol's ship, Dar-Benn meets with the leader of the two planets she messed up and agrees to work on fixing things as reparations for *doing what she was mad at Carol for*.

It was quite fun, and I do really like Brie Larson. I didn't watch Ms Marvel but I might now because Iman Vellani was positively adorable. Photon was... okay I suppose. She didnt stand out much except in the musical planet

Reviewers were too harsh. I would 100% see this again (unlike Quantumania or Love & Thunder). The tone felt coherent, pacing felt fine.

">I'm glad the 3rd act wasn't another cgi battle.

While true, I thought the climactic final boss battle was very lackluster. Maybe because it was like 4 *seriously* overpowered individuals, but I would've liked to see more drama interspersed with the fighting.

Arguing back and forth while battling is one of my favorite tropes when done well. It makes for a better fight than just... action figures pew-pewing each other.

Enjoyed the movie overall, but the last fight, just like the villain, was forgettable 5 minutes after it ended.",2023-11-12 00:05:53

You're right about the terrible jokes and lack of any real drama. Brie Larson can't act. She sounds permanently uptight with an annoying verbal fry. I didn't find Iman Vellani charming, but annoying. I don't blame her, this must be how the production executives told her to act. This would be their idea of what a high school girl is like.

Unfortunately, the her powers are leagues above 90% of MCU characters, and have powerful characters has always been a challenge for most writers. 

It seems easier to write them out of the story (Thor and Hulk before Civil War), brainwash them and have other heroes fight them (Superman in Justice League, Hulk in Age of Ultron), or find something for weaker characters to do while the heavyweights handle the fighting (Batman in Justice League/ BvS Doomsday fight)",2023-11-11 20:15:06

The movie is fun. There are some legitimately gorgeous shots in the beginning (Captain Marvel floating towards the planet upside down) and the first fight scene with them swaping spots was a blast. I actually thought 'Damn, this is shot well.' while watching it. Up through the Musical planet the movie seemed fine. The bonding between the three heroes was good, and Captain Marvel yelling to Kamala ""We save who we can."" hit right.

Then show the fallout from that, and how she starts feeling guilty and can't return to Earth. So she starts a solitary life in space helping people who need her, trying to atone for what she's done. She would be kind of like a lone samurai at this point, with a western vibe. It would have been so good if this movie actually had spaghetti western vibes.

"PROBLEM 2) Monica's power set is poorly defined, she lacks strong character development with Kamala and Carol, and her sacrifice at the end of the film is not given enough setup, weight, and space to breathe.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTENDED ARC 2)

A) Monica, feeling abandoned by Carol and guilty about missing the death of her mother, has thrown herself into her work as a scientist working for S.W.O.R.D. in space.  Undervaluing her own life and safety, she once again investigates a strange energy barrier and becomes entangled with Kamala and Carol.

B) Monica meets Carol again and is initially angry, hurt, and distant due to feelings of abandonment and guilt.  She refuses to open up to Carol.

C)  The Kree attack in Kamala's house/the moon/planet? where the second bangle was found/and the S.W.O.R.D. space station.   Monica tries to fight on her own despite the switching and it is a chaotic mess.

D) Monica meets Kamala and her family and is reminded of happier times with her own mom and aunt Carol.

E) She hypothesizes the reason for the switching, saves Kamala's life, and suggests that they remain together until they can solve the problem and Carol agrees.

F)  Monica begins to interact with Kamala and they discuss the spcific abilities and limitations of their light-based powers.  Kamala talks about how she is annoyed by, but also understand and loves her family members.  Carol listens, but refuses to join in.

G) After spending some time on Carol's ship, Monica notices that Carol lacks some  technical expertise and helps her repair the ship, she begins to understand that Carol has also been lonely and asks some questions about the abilities of Goose and of Flerken in general.

H) All three fight Dar-Benn again, and are beaten

I) During the Kree mindmeld, Monica is angry when they all share memories of her as a young child, her dusting/return, and her mother's decline and death.  Monica and Carol share a heart to heart about Maria.  Monica admits she feels guilt for not being present at her mom's death and anger about Carol not returning.  Carol explains her own feelings of guilt abut Hala, and then tells Monica about Maria's final days and how she would be proud of her daughter.  Carol says that she is proud of Monica.  Group hug.

J)  Training montage.

K)They fight Dar-Benn again after having mastered the switching and are victorious by using innovative switching techniques that Monica suggested during the training montage.

L)  Dar-Benn betrays them, steals both bangles, and rips open a dimensional rift, destroying herself and leaving the bangles.  Carol retrieves the bangles, gives both to Kamala.  When she puts them both on, there is a lengthy power-up scene a la Hulk putting on Thanos' Glove, and the resulting wave of energy undoes the switching.

M)  Monica realizes that she alone has the power to seal the rift.  She does so, but it refuses to seal, and begins to open again.  She realizes that it must be sealed from the other side.  Carol and Kamala are concerned, but do not realize her sacrifice until it is too late.

N)  Monica wakes up to see her mom alive, releases all of her sorrow, guilt, and joy, then realizes it is Binary from another universe.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS 2)

Monica is the Donatello of the group (Carol is Leo, Kamala is Mikey, Dar-Benn, had she been developed, would be Raph/Shredder) and the straight woman, comedically speaking.  Her personality is meant to ground the high spirits of Kamala and the personal loss of her mother is meant to humanize the grand, unrelatable stakes of entire planets dying.  As the science expert, most of the infodumping duty falls on her shoulders.  All of this is a bit generic, especially in light of the fact that the MCU already has Shuri and Riri as STEM nerds.  It would be helpful to differentiate Monica as much as possible to increase variety.

The main problem with Monica's arc is that her ultimate act at the end of the movie has no impact because it is not clear to the audience what she's leaving behind by making the sacrifice.  She has no family left, we don't see her develop any serious relationships with S.W.O.R.D. staff, Kamala, or even Carol.  In order to make the audience care about her final act, this needs to be addressed.

We can solve both of these issues by giving Monica a love interest.  In order to pass the Bechtel test, an admirable goal, many films aimed at young women have gone to the extreme, and made all of their female action heroes asexual, a problem that all Marvel characters, male and female have to an extent.  If you want to attract more female viewers, as this film clearly does, it will be necessary to show romantic human relationships without making them the center of the plot.  If Monica had a boyfriend or even a potential boyfriend coworker in S.W.O.R.D. it would potentially accomplish four goals simultaneously:

First, it would immediately differentiate Monica from Shuri and Riri by establishing Monica as the adult and the romantic scenes would provide some fan service (light, MCU level of course)  for both men and women.  Second, it would give Monica another important thing to lose when she traps herself on the other side of the rift.  Third, it would provide a topic (boyfriends) for Kamala to joke about and discuss with Monica, bringing them closer together before they discuss more serious issues relating to their mission and powers.  And finally, fourth, it would give the potential destruction of the S.W.O.R.D. station higher stakes instead of treating the crisis as nothing but a Tribble-inspired joke.

Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with including a Tribble-inspired jokey Flerken solution to the evacuation, but by adding the conversation and questions in G), we can foreshadow this silliness a bit so it is not as out of nowhere for members of the audience who are less tolerant of random goofiness.  It's also a chance for Carol to open up emotionally about her affection for Goose, weakening Monica's emotional guard, so that when we spend more time developing and building up to I),the group hug isn't as abrupt and feels earned and satisfying.

Another huge problem is that Monica's power set is vague and undefined, so her act at the end of the film comes out of nowhere.  The audience just has to accept that closing dimensional rifts is something that she can do now, and apparently could always do, question mark?

This could be solved by adding F), which is completely missing from the film.  It would be a great bonding moment for Monica and Kamala to discuss their powers, and a perfect opportunity to foreshadow her sacrifice by including information about the ability to manipulate or close gates.  This could also be foreshadowed more strongly  in the first space scene when she approaches the barrier.  Perhaps something from Fury along the lines of, ""Is the tear small enough for you to close with your powers, Monica?""

The fight at K) is weak as was addressed above in the Carol section.  By adding some interesting moves utilizing switching that Monica suggests during the montage, it would reinforce her role in the team as the strategist and thinker.

L) and M) are way too rushed and a bit cheap-looking.  This is the resolution of the film and the place to slow down and spend that effects budget.  By adding her failing initially to seal the rift from our side in M), it is made more clear to the audience what exactly she is planning when her sacrifice is made.

And finally, N) starts out as emotional, then undercuts Monica's sorrow by immeditaely throwing in a silly joke exclamation.  Let the sorrow sit for just a smidge longer, so the audience can see how much grief and guilt  Monica was holding in that led to her final act.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monica's arc is handled better than Carol's, but the lack of any connection to the people of this universe makes her final act less effective at moving the audience.  By giving her a stronger personal connection to Carol, Kamala, and a new love interest, the audience understands that she will lose important things by leaving this universe behind, and by including more information about her powers, foreshadowing the closing of the rift, and letting her experience the sorrow of loss after she is trapped on the other side, the audience is mentally prepared and informed enough to anticipate her sacrificial act and has time to care about its consequences.

Well, that's more than enough Monday morning quarterbacking for today.  In a later reply, I'll address the very teensie tiny issues with Kamala's arc, which is by far the best part of the movie, and eventually discuss possible solutions to the worst and most neglected part of the film, Dar-Benn.",2023-11-14 00:14:03

Pop music. Quips every minute. No one taking anything seriously. Jokes all the time. Blue beam in the sky. Another save the world/universe plot. 

I knew it would be a dog shit movie and I was right in every way.

>And why cannot be criticized in a creative and constructive way instead of doing it for the sake of meanness?

""The poor billion dollar company, Disney. Will someone please be nice to Disney. Wahhhh.""

Marvel is fucking everywhere and it's practically ruined other movies. It's so bad it's called ""Marvelization"". Now everyone wants a cinematic universe. Everyone writes quippy, ""doesn't take anything seriously"" characters characters now.

You want constructive criticism? Marvel should've stayed a prestigious film only franchise. It sorta was a prestige blockbuster brand because it rocketed so many actors. Now Disney has killed the golden goose and diluted the Marvel and completely ruined people's appetite. The Marvels is the peak example.",2023-11-13 19:23:34

"Hate to say it, but I don't know if I trust Taika Waititi after the major tonal mistakes in Thor: Love and Thunder. But like you, I agree that the crazier parts are highlights here. I wouldn't undersell the creativity and bonkers nature of them switching places while fighting Kree (which was also awesome) and the team training montage.

I don't really agree with your two changes either. They both seem to be about making the villain less of a villain. Dar-Benn is a minor comic book footnote that is meant to be thrown away. While predictable, she is here basically as a religious imperialist that is angry at her god being killed. She's single minded and non-compromising. She's there to bring this team together, further the multiverse saga, and get tossed away. (Which I think is OK. Common complaint of MCU villains, but save the depth for the important ones: Thanos, Loki, Kang, Doom.)",2023-11-11 20:14:42
">Dar-Benn takes the offer to fix Hala's sun. Because killing the last leader is what fucked up Hala last time by causing the war. They close the hole via Monica's powers, and then we get a scene above Hala after Carol fixes the sun, where on Carol's ship, Dar-Benn meets with the leader of the two planets she messed up and agrees to work on fixing things as reparations for doing what she was mad at Carol for.

I really thought this is what was going to happen. Not to sound like a cranky man or anything, but it was clear to me at some point that this movie featuring three female heroes and one female villain, a whole side plot featuring cats, and a musical planet where the prince is a beautiful K-pop man, that this movie was targeted at a female audience. 

It was around then that I started thinking they would actually *talk* to the villain and achieve some kind of resolution rather than just killing her like they normally do, and how refreshing that would be.",2023-11-12 17:05:28
"""It can't be this goofy the whole way, it needs to conform to the generic marvel tone.""

Definitely felt this. I really wish in particular that they fully committed to the singing planet bit.

The battle scene on that planet could have been such a blast if they had the defenders singing the whole time.",2023-11-29 05:37:33
"Honestly agree overall. I think you could honestly even still have Dar-Benn fake out accepting the deal and then kill herself overloading the jump network, but have somebody or something set up in the wings. Like maybe establish that the beardy Kree guy is clearly her no2 and not just a random advisor or something. Because right now it's definitely feel-good in the moment that they get their sun back, and I guess we just have to overlook that their atmosphere and their water were stolen from other worlds that they fucked over, but the more you think about it if the last power vacuum triggered a civil war destroyed the planet what's to stop it from happening again now? There definitely needed to be something there to show some stability.",2023-11-12 02:26:07
"I think you're simplifying the issue. Fixing the sun doesn't magically undo all of the damage and death Carol had already caused the Kree. Dar-Benn was blinded by vengeance, which is also why the Kree Skrull conflict is still going on",2023-11-12 20:22:58
"My constant thought the whole time was ""this needed to lean into the silly shit more and Taika would have been a great fit for this"". At times it felt like it wanted to be James Gunn/GOTG but I think Taika was the closer match.

My read was different from yours. The Kree are established as a empire and they could be quite brutal from what I know. Carol basically crippled their empire when she destroyed the Supreme Intelligence that guided them, that seems to have been ok from the pov of most of their subjects from what we've seen but it was obviously bad for the people on Hala, the empires capital. 

To me a better real world analogy would be someone crippling the USA and ending it's status as the dominant power on Earth but the price is poverty and civil war for every remaining US citizen. You're left asking if that price, paid after the fact, was worth ending their dominance.

Thanos was punching CM in Endgame and she didn't feel anything. Dar-Benn was able to fist fight CM before getting powered up.

The singing planet was a bit odd but it was like 5 minutes so ill let that slide. The action sequences were fun and well done and it advanced all 3 stars of the movie in a positive way which many movies do not do.

"It's a culmination of a lot of things, I think.  

First off the political climate.  There has been some pandering from Marvel/Disney.  She-Hulk writers openly alienated the core fans of comic books (males 18-45). So some of 'those' fans have knee-jerk reactions and judge before knowing the whole picture.

The hate on The Marvels wasn't deserved there.

On Alison Brie:  She's not an A-lister, and is expected to carry the Marvel Banner.  That's a heavy fucking load and she hasn't built enough.... 'star equity' to be able to easily do it.  That's a tough fucking job.

Also, some fans just don't like her because of things she's said in the past.  Someone asked for her number then she posted, ""to live like a woman is to live in defense"" because someone was interested in her.  

Another time she's said, ""I don't need another 40-year old white man to tell me what he thinks about a Wrinkle in time, the movie wasn't made for him!""

Hey, it's cool to want opinions of others but straight up how can people not take it as if she feels a certain type of way about them?  Imagine if RDJ read some reviews from teen girls about Ironman then says, ""I don't need another 15 year old girl to tell me what she thinks about iron man, it wasn't made for her!"" lol",2023-11-11 23:50:34

I loved the first 2 ant man films and I ADORE Paul rudd like I will watch anything he is in, and I walked out of that film ANGRY because it was so so so bad. That was the film that deserved to bomb, it was truly just awful to sit through.

The Marvels though? I mean, it's mid. But it was ENTERTAINING. I had a good time.

"Story had strong potential with the aftermath of destroying the Supreme intelligence and a villain with a sympathetic motivation. Dialogue and cast chemistry was fantastic. 

Carol and Monica both had a lot more emotional range than in previous outings, which was a relief.  Direction and pacing I think we're likely linked. Pacing was my biggest complaint--15 more minutes to let some sequences breathe a little more would have made it feel a little less choppy. 

Visuals are solid, and there was some really great cinematography and interesting composition. Music was really great as well.

-Original cut of the first movie leaned in heavily to Danver's queerness as was basically a big coming out metaphor, Disney execs 86ed it because China (but there still some artifacts leftover in the theatrical release), which is why the first movies kinda a mess 

-Larson was not particularly happy about this decision, a big part of why she signed on to play Carol Danvers was the queerness/LGBTQI+ representation, led to a lot of behind the scenes back and forths between her and Disney high ups, which led to her role in Infinity war being trimmed way down

Their way of life was Imperialism though, the Kree were conquerors who built their empire and held it together with the barrel of a gun. There's a really interesting dilemma there, empires can bring stability and trade, and even bring people together from many different backgrounds, but at the end of the day their subjects often lack the rights that many of us take for granted.

The biggest issue honestly I had with her was that she absolutely GUSHED confidence in Avengers Endgame, and I wanted THAT Carol, the one who was self assured and maybe a bit cocky, but instead she felt closer to how she was in Captain Marvel, uneasy, unsure, confused, and regretful.

I understand why in the story she is confused (cuz confusing things are happening), but it gave little room for us to understand her. 

We did at least learn why she was absent for so long. She was trying to fix everyone and everything. A lesson Kamala also had to learn painfully.

"That sounds like a lot of BS. 

First off, she wasn't in Infinity War. That came out before the first CM film came out (Infinity War June 2018 and Captain Marvel March 2019). Endgame was the one she in, and the issue there is Endgame was mostly filmed in 2017 concurrently with Captain Marvel. There were re-shoots in 2018, so theoretically that is when the role trimming could have occurred. And there was a lot of back and forth about how Captain Marvel was filmed without a clear shooting script, so it makes sense some early ideas (such as Carol being queer) might have been cut since it didn't really matter to the final plot at all. 

Could Larson and Disney execs had a falling out about how the character was written overall? Sure, I buy that. But pointing it all on some queer aspect that is not even in the final product seems like a massive stretch by someone with an agenda. 

I think it's more likely the character was just a mess from an overall writing perspective (which is on screen) and holding back Brie's natural chemistry, which made her upset and the character fall flat for audiences.",2023-11-10 19:09:24

This despite the fact I never actually mentioned the sex of the leads in my entire critique. I've seen this happening over and over.

Assuming it's true in the first place, the filmmakers probably made the decision to go that route before she even signed on.

Adaptations aren't always completely faithful and afaik Larson has never indicated that she was a fan of the character beforehand, so she probably doesn't have any particular attachment to the source material.

"Two things can be true. 

Marvel doesn't spend enough money and time on their full cg character sequences. It also makes no sense to put that much effort into a post credits scene only character. 

Counterpoint I would use is Thanos. He didn't look great in Avengers, looked just..  okay in Guardians of the Galaxy, but in Infinity War and Engame looked great. 

I think the way Marvel produces movie is to blame. They shoot a LOT and then put the movie together in post production, and a lot of the cg scenes change dramatically throughout that process. 

Movies like Dead Man's Chest had a lot of preproduction work going into their characters, an actual shooting script that reflected the final film, etc. They knew enough they could have specific lighting references and such on set, they probably did a TON of testing and reworking for their target result. 

CG is a chisel: you can plan ahead and iterate on a single work to get a Michaelangelo, or you can just go ham and make a bunch of shit quickly. Marvel seems much more content with the latter.",2023-11-12 12:54:21

he is on another level, yes, but he is also in that very sweet spot where he could lead a team of younger heroes, for 2 reasons 

1. He is of the same generation as them. Remember, he just graduated high school. He's a few years older than Kamala and possibly younger than Kate or Shuri.
2. He has fought with teh Avengers before, so he knows how they work. He worked with Iron Man and Dr. Strange already. He's also worked with other Spider-Men. So he's pretty capable working in a team, and leading it.

According to the director, Jackman's love letter to Wolverine takes place approximately five years after the conclusion of X-Men: Days of Future Past, around the year 2029. While there are small differences between the films' respective worlds, Mangold wanted to keep the established continuity while still having the creative freedom to say a proper goodbye to Wolverine, thus deciding to end Wolverine's story within the Days of Future Past timeline.**

With comic books, though, having to adjust to these issues doesn't necessarily lower their quality, since the focus isn't on those elements.

I don't call myself a fanboy because there are people who consume way more comic-book content and are way more knowledgeable of the characters. Movies or not, I would be scolded for calling myself a fanboy.

> Just to be clear you only go to the theater to see CBM's,

Yup only CBMs. There was some one offs a few years ago when I was into Godzilla but I think it's better to watch them on streaming. I did watch Sonic 2 in theaters because I was following a movie podcast for a while. I wanted to watch it ASAP so I could listen to the podcast episode. The podcast is over and done with so I probably won't do something like that again.

>  nothing like Oppenheimer. Mission Impossible or John Wick?

Absolutely not. I wouldn't even watch those if they were on free streaming platforms. I saw the first *John Wick* and was bored out of my mind. I need some kind of hi fantasy/sci-fi in most of the content I consume. I watch movies and TV to escape reality. I tried to watch *The Irishman* but I had to do it in multiple sittings and ultimately didn't finish it because it was so boring.

I do watch other kinds of movies and TV. in 2022, my favorite movie I saw was probably *Prey* on Hulu. I did also watch *The Menu* and *EEAAO*. *The Menu* is probably a contender for my top movie of 2022 but it's a very different movie than *Prey* so it's hard to compare. I recently watched *The Bear* and *Monk* for TV shows. I'm not exclusive to comicbook content.

> Just have 2 films a year and 2-3 Disney+ shows, start going quality over quantity.

Agree with the films. They should have never done the TV shows. It's too much and TV is always of lower production quality than movies. Sure maybe some heroes need a multi-episode series to tell their story but I haven't been happy with any of the TV show yet. Plus I don't want to pay for Disney+. 

> But a Blade film will be R, but that doesn't mean they also can't have a Young Avengers series on Disney+.
