"The set-up for Miles to land in the spider’s universe and not his own was such a slow burn. He’s finally willing to share his secret only to have his mother not be “his” mother, and the comic-con callback from the first movie was a great way to hit the nail home.",2023-06-02

"I like how they kept the ""yeah I think it's a banksy"" line from the first movie. Really cool to see insomniacs spiderman included for a second there.

But the funniest part was when the audience voiced their collective shock and annoyance at the ‘to be continued’",2023-06-02
"The animation in this movie is STAGGERINGLY gorgeous.

I’m finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable. No joke.

There are obviously tons of other shows and movies with phenomenal animation, maybe even perfect animation, but the combination of art direction and animation in this movie is just a tier by itself.

It doesn’t feel random or just for shits and giggles, it serves real purpose to characters and plot and visual information. I fucking love it.

Whatever praise this movie gets for animation, it deserves more. This is an incredible achievement. It’s hard to even comprehend how they were able to not only create so many styles, but seamlessly integrate them in scenes together. Not just drawing styles, but literally how things moved, vibrated, looked, felt. It’s insane. Kudos to everyone who worked on this film, it’s a true work of art.",2023-06-02
I was hoping for way more LEGO Spiderman during this movie. I was honestly laughing so hard that they could incorporate the LEGO universe,2023-06-02
"I know this will be said a million times, and rightfully so, but holy shit was this a gorgeous movie. Literally every frame could be a framed painting.

I love how the one constant in the Spiderverse is apparently JK Simmons is always J Jonah Jameson.

They did a really good job of making Spot, freaking Spot, a pretty terrifying villain in the end.

The entire voice cast was excellent across the board.

If Beyond can keep this momentum, and I see little reason why it wouldn't, then this will be one of best trilogies of all time.",2023-06-02
I like how Gwen’s world was more water color and you could see it start to drip and bleed into other colors during the talk with her Dad as her superhero and civilian identity were blending together.,2023-06-02
"Having a central villain being a literal plot hole threatening Spider-Man canon is both hilarious and genius

Also, just, so much of the plot hinging on the idea that Spider-People are inevitably fated to be sad and lonely (unless they're Peter B. and impacted by Miles) feels really apt considering how much discourse I've seen about how recent comics have treated Peter",2023-06-02
"Ben Reilly really stole the show with his muscle definition, striking poses and tough talk!!",2023-06-02
"I remember seeing that The Spot was going to be the villain of the movie, and once he got reprimanded by Miles at the beginning I thought, “damn, that just have been a smokescreen for Miguel to be the real villain”, but nope. Dude got so much scarier as the film went on and especially after the collider. Such a wonderfully crafted villain.",2023-06-02

"One of the key aspects of this movie is how it begins with Gwen and how Gwen is essentially the co-lead in the movie.

That is why, even though the movie ends on a cliffhanger, it feels like its own movie.  The scene toward the end with Gwen and her dad functioned for me like an emotional resolution within the movie.

Had tears in my eyes during that scene.",2023-06-02

"Anyone (and it looks like it’s everyone) who liked the Gwen and Earth 65 story and style need to check out the Latour run of Spider-Gwen. 

The style and story were heavily inspired or straight up pulled from page to screen—it was perfect. It’s one of my favorite runs ever and I was so excited when I realized that’s what they were doing right at the start of movie. 12/10",2023-06-02
"Having The Spot be the guy who got Bagel’d in the first movie is maybe the great retcon since Rogue One explained the Death Star design flaw.

"The animation the whole movie was amazing but Gwen’s earth? Stunning. I was in awe of every moment there. 

What a beautiful movie and I can’t wait for Beyond the Spider-Verse.",2023-06-02
"One of the best sequels of all-time!

- Cold open with Gwen, telling her side of the story, makes this movie hers as much as Miles'
- Spot being guy that got hit by the bagel is one of the funniest callbacks
- Miles struggle is well depicted and Brian Tyree Henry as Miles' father is the standout for me
- The soundtrack was pretty great but it went hard in the Mumbattan sequence 
- Everything in Spider HQ was perfect! The scope, the cameos (both animated and live action), the secret revealed, the chase sequence
- One of the best plot twists ever with Miles being in Earth-42. I never saw that coming


I didn't think it could match the first one but it did! 
Will easily win the Best Animated movie at the Oscars and has a decent shot of being nominated for Best Picture",2023-06-02
"Seeing spectacular spider-man get the recognition is deserves. Love to see it. They actually gave Josh Keaton some lines and used one it’s episodes during the Uncle Ben segment. 

Miles saying he’s gonna do his own thing reminded me of Final Fantasy 10 and how they say, “this is my story” and it’s fitting. 

Great movie and it they stick the landing, could be of the greatest trilogies.

And Mayday wearing Spider-Ham pajamas was adorable.",2023-06-02
"I've never been to a movie before where a full theatre started screaming in pain at the same time.

Looking forward to Beyond",2023-06-02
"Loved the movie, but can someone explain to me, if Miles was an anomaly, how is his dad a canon level event, or why did that matter? That was the only thing that confused me. He wasn’t allowed to join the society for that reason, but then when he was there, wasn’t allowed to leave?",2023-06-02

"It’s going to take me three more times to catch all the details. Moms snapping in Puerto Rican, Hobie casually stealing everything not nailed down, this movie is a visual feast and I’m almost sad I’m not going to get the same experience with the first where I actually waited until it was streaming, watched it once, then watched again scene by scene catching all the tiny details. Until it is streaming, the theatre is gonna have to take my money a few more times.",2023-06-02
"I have absolutely no doubt that the writers meant this movie as a criticism of Spider-Man comic writers. If it wasn’t on purpose, I would be SHOCKED. Miguel’s whole deal being, “Spider-Man must never change, you have to follow the same beats,” is a direct reflection of the writers who keep dragging Peter back from anything different, new, and exciting. I’m honestly super impressed that they made this the focus and I have a sliver of hope that they might actually help move Spider-Man along for the better.",2023-06-02
"Something funny I just realized about Peter B Parker in this movie:

For those unaware, one of the biggest criticisms of the Spider-Man comics in recent years is how Marvel tries to maintain the same status quo for Peter after several decades of basically telling the same stories over and over again - many fans want him to finally get married to MJ and have a kid together, but Marvel continuously refuses, instead choosing to constantly try and keep Peter in the same state of being poor/single/etc that he's been in for years, sometimes [going to ridiculous extents](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Paul_Rabin_(Earth-TRN1023)) to do so. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9w3jknfNIA) does a good job of explaining a lot of the general sentiments among the fans have

In the movie, Peter B Parker, motivated by his experiences with Miles in the first movie, finally gets together with Mary Jane and they have a daughter together. However, it is also explicitly stated by Miguel that the events of the first movie - including Miles getting bitten and meeting Peter B Parker - were anomalies and should have never happened.

The implication of this is that all of Peter B Parker's character growth that pushed him to finally become a father wasn't supposed to happen, so by giving birth to MayDay, Peter B Parker effectively broke the ""canon"".

I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but if it was then that means the movie was intentionally making fun of the Spider-Man comics' complete refusal to let Peter grow up and develop in his relationships, which I think is hilarious, *especially* if you're at all familiar with the current run of the comics",2023-06-03
"The animation was NEXT LEVEL!! The scene with Gwen and the paint was dripping, the plastic blowing when miles told his dad to let him spread his wings... Sooo many awe inspiring moments in a fantastic film! Highly highly encourage anyone to see this in IMAX if you can",2023-06-02
"This movie was NOT 2 hours and 20 minutes long.

I mean not only was Donald the inspiration for miles he also voiced miles in his first animated appearance in ultimate Spider-Man tv show! So the fact that they literally had him as is homecoming character in the prowler outfit was great! Also I left right after so didn’t see the credits wasn’t feeling good think I over indulged in junk food and I wasn’t 100% sure but was that mahershala voicing earth 43 Aaron?

Only thing is, I don’t know if it was just how they had the sound at my theater or if it was the sound mixing in the movie, but there were a lot of moments where the soundtrack was booming and the dialogue got lost and I couldn’t hear what they were saying. Like even Gwen’s opening monologue I could barely hear. I almost wished I had closed captioning. Was it like this for anyone else or was it just the speakers in my theater? My husband and I might try to watch in a different theater",2023-06-02

"It's perplexing how Sony on one end spits out the worst superhero live action films milking the Spider-Man villains arsenal for all it's worth, and then Sony Pictures Animation turns around and gives us 2 of the best animated movies of the last 10 years, one of which being on the shortlist for best superhero movie ever made. If they stick the landing next year Spiderverse is something that can give Nolan a challenge for the best superhero trilogy. My god was this movie ever beautiful. Scenes in Gwen's house, Hobie, Ben Reilly, and the Vulture from the beginning were the visual stand-outs for me. Hobie looked like a ransom note glued together from weathered concert posters. Ben looked like Mark Bagley drew a flip book. The watercolor changing with Gwen and Captain Stacy's emotions was gorgeous. 

One other thing the Miles-universe nails that I think Marvel Studios should take note of is tone. This movie got all it's quips in and funny moments while still having an unbroken moody and serious attitude the whole way through. It didn't have the tonal dissonance of something like Quantumania or especially Thor L&T with that movie's bait and switch marketing.",2023-06-02

"That James Blake song fucking rules. 

So many incredible moments. The agency of his parents specifically his mom, ramping up, the Spot becoming legitimately terrifying. Spider Punk stole the show in his brief lines. The watercolors in Gwen’s scenes. 

Legitimately do not think I’ve ever seen an animated movie this ambitious. It goes without saying but if they stick this landing, it’s the best superhero trilogy of all time. 

Ps, maybe I’m tripping, but we didn’t see 90s Spiderman right? I definitely saw villains from the series but not the Spiderman from the 90s cartoon. I hope we somehow get him. 

Also the fight choreography was INSANE",2023-06-02
"Hey Marvel,

I think I'm speaking for all of us by asking you to release that upside down shot of New York with Miles & Gwen sitting together so we can all set it as our backgrounds.

"Donald Glover’s return and used as a semi-Chekov’s gun/twist (many people wondered if he would’ve played the live action Miles in the MCU) was well played by Lord and Miller’s writing.

"I hope that somebody calls Miguel out on his fundamental misunderstanding of the ""Canon events"" and their importance in Beyond.

Imprisoning Miles so he couldn't try and save his dad wouldn't have done any good -- it's not the Event that matters, it's how that event reshapes Spider-Man.

A loved one dies because you fail to save them, and you learn a lesson -- be that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,"" whatever. A loved one dies because someone *imprisoned* you so you *could not* save them, and you become angry and vengeful.

"There is so much to say about this movie, but for this comment I'll focus on one thing.

Despite this being a part 1 of 2, I didn't feel unsatisfied or cheated out of an ending, and I was wondering how they pulled that off. I think they did it by pulling a really clever trick with Gwen, namely by making her the main character.

The movie's central conflict between Miles, the Spot, and Miguel absolutely did not conclude, but the film still managed to feel complete because Gwen's personal conflict does conclude. She reconciles with her dad, reconciles with herself and her self concept as Spider-Woman after losing Peter, and finally fully sides with Miles to stand up to Miguel. The movie starts with her and ends with her, and so it feels complete.",2023-06-02

That being said, I love that the movie wasn’t afraid to be emotional and pull their punch with a cheap joke. Which is even more impressive when you realize it’s also a Lord and Miller movie",2023-06-02
"I found it really interesting that Miles points out that from his viewpoint, the Spidermen were the bad guys while they thought he was as an anomaly.

"This might be the most visually insane movie I have ever seen. The animation is constantly changing and constantly amazing. The color palettes in the universes being unique is a great idea executed perfectly. Gwens universe looked especially beautiful at points. 

This really is a spectacle that has to be seen on the big screen. If you’re a diehard Spider-Man fan then this movie has endless easter eggs that even go beyond that. I have to see it again before I can say if it’s my favorite Spider-Man movie (overtaking the last Spider-Verse) but I’m happy to do so because this is a movie you have to view multiple times.

Miguel pulling a reverse Wanda Maximov and putting himself into a universe where he died, achieving Kingpin’s dream from the first movie all in the name of parenthood.

Oh yeah and Hailee Steinfeld deserves an Oscar for her performance here, all of the scenes when she’s paired up with her dad were beautifully executed. Easily the best parts of the film for me personally.",2023-06-02
"I was unsure if they could top the first movie. The first movie really leaned into the whole meta-aware ""you know the rest"" attitude.

I thought it could only be a one-time gimmick. But they've pulled it off again in a way that is still fresh, character-focused, and true to what Spider-man is... 

At the time of Spider-man's conception, superheroes were not relatable kids. They were larger than life figures. He was a rebellion against the tropes of his time.

Now here in the present, we have a story of a Spider-man who wants to rebel against his own story tropes.",2023-06-02

"I feel like the one aspect a lot of viewers will miss is when Miguel O'Hara is explaining the interconnectivity of the Spider-Verse.

Before we see the Web of Life (Spider-Verse)...Miguel shows the Marvel Multiverse as depicted by Disney & Marvel Studios. This wasn't just a reinterpretation, reimagining, or newly designed display...NO. This film showed the multiverse exactly as it was shown in **'Avengers: Endgame'**, **'Loki'**, and **'Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania'**.

So that leaves us with a ton of new info.

1.) The Marvel Mutliverse connects the Disney/Marvel Studios multiverse and the Sony-verse into the same multiverse. Now I know a lot of you are saying that ""didn't NWH already confirm this?"" but the thing is that NWH was a Sony/Disney production. This is the first time a solo Sony film acknowledges a non-Spider-Man movie. Soon the defunct 20th/Fox multiverse too with **'Deadpool 3'**.

2.) Doctor Strange was name dropped in a Sony film post 2004 (which means Sony had to get some sort of approval from Disney)

3.) Add the multiple Spider-Man namedrops in **'Multiverse of Madness'** & **'Quantumania'** (which are the 1st times Spidey has ever been mentioned in a film he wasn't in, another Sony approval)

4.) The way that Tobey & Andrew had live-action cameos (albeit, in clip show form)

5.) Donald Glover's live-action MCU Prowler cameo, (which means Disney/Marvel Studios & Sony had to agree on this cameo)

All tells us a lot about how Sony & Disney will move forward.

Expect a live-action Tom Holland in **'Beyond the Spider-Verse'**.

I think Sony & Disney/Marvel Studios are now a married couple.

The fans won.",2023-06-02
"I loved Oscar Isaccs voice as Miguel. Not scary in a traditional way, but you could hear the desperation in his voice to keep things intact. Really well done role. The animation was super smooth with each song fitting the mood perfectly. Ingenious storytelling really. No BS, well layered, deep, and complex.",2023-06-02
Probably my biggest disappointment (but also one of the more interesting aspects) is that there wasn't necessarily a traditional climax. Hell the movie didn't really follow a traditional story arc in general. Even though it's a cliff hangar the movie does sorta just...end.,2023-06-02
"What I really loved about this movie was that it didnt feel like an animated movie. There's this preconception in Hollywood that animation has to be aimed at kids to succeed or that adults won't go see animated films so often times they force the creators to make the movies aimed at kids. With ATSV they didnt do that. This movie didnt have any of those corny child jokes you see in animated movies or make things more childish, it was a more mature storyline with proper character arcs and everything that you find in live action masterpieces, and I really appreciate that.",2023-06-02
"When they kept mentioning Hobie, I kept thinking he was gonna be some dislikeable character whose closeness with Gwen made Miles jealous.

Instead, he was Miles #1 guy and my favourite character introduced in this movie.

Every word out of his mouth was gold and he kept coming in clutch for Miles and Gwen.

And the way he just dipped out when the fighting began was perfect. I've never vibed with a character more than at that moment.

10/10 movie. Will watch in theatres again.

Also DID THAT NEWS LADY AT THE END SAY ""THE SINISTER SIX CARTEL?"" WTF?!! I WANT MORE OF THAT!",2023-06-02
"\-Spider-Punk is the real hero, without him Gwen would end up in her universe much longer

\-MCU Vulture ended up in Morbius makes more sense now (see Rennaissance Vulture, and other villain who ended up in wrong universe) (Strange spell only makes them go into MCU, not the other way around)

\-(bit reaching) but when Miguel says ""Strange and some nerd in #19999"" mean there's no Peter Parker inside the MCU anymore, and the multiverse acknowledge it.

\-two bagel in best multiverse movie so far ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" & ""Across the spider verse""

\-the ending of this movie is the premise of the 'Flash Movie' two weeks after, funny coincidence

\- I can safely say that this movie is far better and more concise rather than the comic book counterpart. (too much spin off comic, makes the main story comic less exciting)",2023-06-02

"HOW does this movie exist! Completely unreal animation, and the characters feel so alive. There's so much to pick apart. Miles is GOATed, The Spot finally gets his flowers, the easter eggs are fan-service but who cares! They added to the universe especially with the commentary on the Spidey mythos. The makers of these movies truly get Spider-Man and just made a phenomenal film. 

Way better cliffhanger than that other movie that came out recently, the stakes feel as high as they did during Infinity War. 11/10, give them the fucking Oscar already.",2023-06-02

"This film was art. 

There was such a strong emotional backbone to this story and I absolutely loved it. Everything popped and felt intense. The music amplified so many scenes that were already visually dense to give you sensory overload in the best of ways.

Return of the Ham!,2023-06-02
"After Fast X two weeks ago, it was really nice to see a really well done true Part 1 film. 

It's also just really nice to watch this movie because it's fuckin great. It feels as inventive and revolutionary visually as the first one felt five years ago, and it doesn't skip a beat with the comedy and emotion. It's a two hour fever dream with not a single visually uninteresting moment. 

I rewatched the first Spider-Verse today and noticed that up until the Super Collider turns on, the movie looks unique but isn't all that crazy. It's not until that turn in the story that we get different art styles and experimentation, and when things glitch it feels like the Collider is bleeding into the ""normal"" world. In the sequel, the blood is woven into the fabric. The experimentation is on full display at all times. A shot of the city will switch to a different style for a couple frames, and some characters seem to move at different frame rates and are downright amazing to watch animate. It really feels like any constraints that may have been present in the first one are absent. 

This movie feels like beautiful experimentation the entire runtime. Starting in Gwen's world where colors bleed into each other like water color, Spider-Man India's world where it's all busy and sun-toned. It's all as specific and beautiful and conceptual as the Spider characters in the first film but this time it's entire worlds. This movie is a visual feast and a total pleasure to watch. 

It's also setting up a fascinating theme about trope infested writing. This really feels like the most successful and interesting take on pop meta filmmaking right now and I can't wait to see what they do to it. To have the main conflict of the movie be that the entire idea of Spider-Man revolves around sacrifice and not being able to save everyone, and have the reinvention of Spider-Man character be the one to say I don't accept that. 

This feels like it could go so many directions in part two, and that's how you do a part one. When credits rolled I felt like they had to because there were so many moving parts that it couldn't wrap up any time soon. But that end shot of Gwen, Peter B, Noir, Penny, and Porker standing by the portal. I tell you I was so pumped I could have punched a hole through a wall. 

And what still works about this movie and elevates it from pop visual spectacle to actual master piece is the characters. Miles' family life is still so sincere and well done. Gwen and Miles is a relationship you pull for but when she said it never ends well I was crushed. You've even got new characters like Hobie and Spider-Man India who are so fun and specific to every line of dialogue and every action. 

The streamlined way they've made to introduce us to new Spideys is so effective that these movies could introduce ten new spiders in a movie and we would still understand and feel for them. Because Spider-Man is a story, in broad strokes, that we all know and love and see ourselves in. And this series is ready to dive into that. To give us so many Spiders you can't help but find the one that speaks to you. And to ask the question, is the tragedy necessary to build the character, or is it manipulative writing that needs its cycle broken? I don't know what they'll do in the next movie but I can't wait to see. I think it's fair to say Spider-Man knows how to stick a landing. It's a 10/10.

"Anyone else just wanted to hold Mayday? She was a chubby little cutie. I loved all the fatherly bits that Peter showered on her. Especially the little kiss on the crown. I bet he was the one who knitted the Spider mask for her. Took the time to learn how to knit and did it himself. 

Love how they kept J.K. Simmons for J. Jonah Jameson. I know that voice anywhere. He is the universal constant for the entire Spider-verse. 

Hobie Brown aka Spider-punk is my new favorite design. I love how the cut and past look to him. He looked like a mash-up of not just old school UK punks but US ones. Like Crass meets Bad Brains. 


I want to know the story about behind Spider-Rex and Spider-Cat. 

Love the use of color in Gwen's world. The contrast between the cold blues and warm pinks.

"I love that Spider-Man is such a unique character in terms of his place in culture that this kind of story can really only be told with him-- all the multiple iterations, the years of comics, the winks and nods, all the different shows, games, and live-action moments that you can drop in to build up this character and the structure of him and what he's ""supposed"" to be like-- all makes Miles' insistence to do his own thing more powerful.",2023-06-02

"Let me tell y'all something! Let me tell y'all something!

This film is freaking amazing! Each frame is a painting. Forget the story, the voice acting, and the music. See this film for the animation alone. I'm serious. Turn off the sound and the experience will be just as captivating. 

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues the Mile Morales arc from the prior feature ""Into the Spider-Verse"". The movie tells a mature story about destiny and belonging. It gets dark at times and the tension rarely eases. Ultimately though, the film is about creativity. Lord, Miller, and Callaham use the film to argue that no property is bound by either narrative bars or the fan base opinions. Any writer can do whatever he/she/they want with an existing IP as long as they have the drive to build that story. 

The true villain is not the Spot or Spider-Man 2099. It's really the limitations writers and audiences alike place on themselves when confronted with a well-known character. Spider-Man has to lose Uncle Ben, Gwen, and the captain for his character development. He should also gain his powers by being bitten by a radioactive spider. He also has to be of a certain race, sexuality, and gender. Such statements are now non-viable notions thanks to this film. 

The animation is the real star of this film. Nothing of this level has been done since Arcane (Netflix/Riot/Fortiche). It may actually be possible that this film was delayed because of Arcane's impact on the animation industry. The style used in Gwen's world is very similar to the painting effect Fortiche implemented in Arcane's animation. Each world has its own unique animation style that is passed onto its respective Spider-Man. Spider-Punk, for instance, is portrayed via 70s pop art collage. 

Miles in this film is stretched between being Spider-Man and being a responsible teenager. He is at odds with his parents, gets a B in Spanish, and shows up late to meaningful events. When he does show up, he lands in trouble. Gwen is shown to be in a similar situation where being Spider-Woman has placed her at odds with her father. Her relationship with her dad is the catalyst for the film's events and ultimately leads her back to Miles.

Gwen and Miles have a teenage love story in this film that is truncated by their ideas of fate. It grows from subtle flirty web slinging and ends abruptly with a painful confession. The romance between the two is akin to Terra and Beast Boy's in the 2003 Teen Titans cartoon where loyalty, friendship, and a sense of belonging tear the two would be lovers apart. 

Ultimately, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing animated feature. It conveys a message about breaking limitations in storytelling while giving the audience a memorable experience through animation and character dynamics. The heart of the film is the relationship between Miles and Gwen, and it will be interesting to see how people react to it. See this movie on the big screen every chance you get.

**Notes** Spoilers Ahoy 

- The studios and production companies title cards intro was hype

- Gwen sure has a habit of leaving stuff around in dimensions she doesn't belong in

- Prowler 2.0 and Uncle Aaron aren't the bad guys in that situation. See the events from their perspective and it becomes apparent why they did what they did

- Donald Glover sure needs something to do now that Atlanta is done. Now that I think about it, Sony couldn't get Lakeith and Zazee in this film too?

- Any Miguel O'Hara theories out there? I have one: He's not being entirely honest about the Spider-Verse. If Miles existence is an aberration outside of the Spider-Man canon, why isn't he allowing Miles to do his own thing?

- Spider-Man noir took one look at that organization and noped out

- Sony Pictures Imageworks dropped the gauntlet! Fortiche has yet to reply with Arcane season 2 (also starring Halee Steinfeld)

- For all that's good, give Brian Michael Bendis a cameo in the sequel. The man created Miles Morales after all",2023-06-02

"The first movie was phenomenal. Animation wise, this makes the preceding film seem like an experiment before taking things up to 11 with this movie. I’d give an arm and a leg to see it for the first time again, despite its very small flaws(some scenes were mixed very badly between dialogue and score)",2023-06-02
"To say this movie is a masterpiece is an understatement. Lord and Miller are just showing off at this point.

This movie did the same “Remember that nondescript background character? He’s now the main villain” and “massive cliffhanger ending” concepts that Fast X just attempted and stumbled on and did them both fantastically.

This movie masterfully did the “comic multiverse Easter Egg” stuff that Doctor Strange absolutely whiffed on, and did it twice. Hell, it made the last Tom Holland Spider-Man movie’s multiverse adventure look like fan fiction.

The fan service moments exceeded massive expectations - fucking Donald Glover shows up! Lego Spider-Man. The Venom-verse. They went beyond what anyone could’ve possibly expected.

Twists you didn’t see coming a mile away.

Only one true J Jonah Jameson - JK Simmons.

At this point, it’s pretty much a lock for the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and we’ll see if it ends up on the Best Picture list.",2023-06-02
"Honestly, even with the beautiful animation and excellent storytelling, the soundtrack was the stand-out of the movie for me. 

Gwen’s new theme was amazing, Miles’ is great as ever, and Miguel’s *especially* blew me away. That creepy futuristic buzzing was chilling in the theater. Tbh I can see it going viral in the same vein as Prowler’s theme from the first movie.",2023-06-02
"Absolutely terrible spot to end the film but despite that it was still great.  Gonna watch it again tomorrow. 

The audio mix was bad though, did anyone else experience that? It was really quiet for some reason and I struggled to hear dialogue. It was actually worse than Tenet's. Not sure if it was an issue with my cinema or what.

Edit: this comment is too negative. The film is fantastic. There were multiple times I was surprised at how impressive something looked, so many sequenced that could have been generic were animated in such a unique way. The writing was great, humour was solid. I just wish it wasn't a part 1 lol.",2023-06-02
"This is gonna be a longshot, but the girlfriend and I are thinking Miguel’s story isn’t as straight as he’s telling it. He conveniently shows up in another universe when alternate family man version of him dies so he can replace him without anyone batting an eye?? Yeah I don’t think so. Miguel killed family-Miguel, replaced him, destroyed a whole universe on accident, and is now trying to prevent others from making the same mistake.",2023-06-02
"Spot going full berserk and the end credit sequence gave me major Mob Psycho 100 vibes. 

I would be so glad if the artists and animators actually took inspiration from a show which also went wild with experimental animation and artsyle!",2023-06-02
Didn’t think I’d ever say this considering I’ve never heard of this character in my life before but The Spot was definitely one of the main highlights for me.

"Movie is so good it makes me want to rewatch it a second or even a third time. Always one of the best part is when Miguel informs everyone to catch spider man and failed to specifically mention miles which brings us into the whole spider society pointing at each other; also a reference to the old spider man cartoon. And everytime the scene where Gwen sits at the window at miles' room, it reminds me of ""the video"" from YouTube . Soundtracks are also a banger.",2023-06-02

"No disrespect to Pixar, but this is the best looking animated film of all time. They upped their game in animation and design with the multiversal characters (looks at renaissance Vulture)",2023-06-04
"Like its predecessor, it was a great time.

I’m not a superhero fan but “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'' was one of the few superheroes films I absolutely love as I thought it was perfectly executed with interesting developed characters, great animation, and structure. With this sequel, while I personally still love the first one, it continues to achieve like its predecessor.

Throughout, the film explores different themes and concepts in the narrative that were a bit darker and sometimes risky which worked very well as it really helped build the characters personality, actions or motivations and setting. As usual, the animation style, colors, designs, and models are excellent and beautiful. The style helps to fit the comic like universe and adds a lot to the scenarios. There are certain shots and frameworks that are seriously burned into my memory because of how beautiful they are. The characters of Miles, Gwen and others were all pretty interesting as the characters' arches and personalities were interesting to observe. I appreciate the emotional aspects surrounding Miles and Gwen's current struggles and family dilemmas as it helped to add some interesting developments even if some small choices weren't too big on me. The voice performances from the cast members were particularly great since each of their voices fit the personality of the characters.

The narrative is fun as the narrative explores some new territories that are dark, comedic, and intriguing which were focused and well-executed without feeling too convoluted. The sound designs, musical score, and many of the technical aspects were very good as well as well with the direction. The pacing was also pretty good with although certain moments did slightly drag a little. As well with a few references that ended up getting a little annoying.

Despite some small gripes, this sequel still manages to live up to its predecessor and it was a great time. I will see Part One again before Part Two comes out to have a much better view on it. Overall, with Beau is Afraid and John Wick: Chapter 4, it’s already one of my favorites of the year so far.

"This movie kinda also feels like a meta commentary on multiverses as a whole. Yes, there is inherent coolness to them that the filmmakers recognize and use to its fullest potential. But it also acts as a “fuck the multiverse” kind of film, where the best part about Spidey is the small-scale choices made beneath the mask.

The constant shifting of background colors to reflect the scene from pink, to orange, to deep red and blue during Gwen’s unmasking scene, ultimately culminating in a darkened scene becoming an incredibly stark, beautiful white when the canon is broken, and Gwen’s dad quits his job during Gwen’s final scene.

"Random Thoughts:

- The soundtrack fucking SLAPPED. I got such big chills when Miguel entered Miles' world at the end.

- They went even crazier with the comic book style of the animation and it was great. A highlight for me was the scene at the beginning when Gwen hugged her dad and the colors of the room suddenly changed.

- Speaking of Gwen, I liked her expanded role in this; She was a proper secondary protagonist. Can't wait until Hailee Steinfeld comes back for her other character who is also a cold, socially dejected fighter with shaved sides (Riot PLEASE)

- MUMBATAN genuinely got a bigger reaction from my theater than the old spideys coming back in NWH.

- Plot structure was weaker than Spiderverse 1. This was clearly written as one long movie that got split in two parts. The ending was very abrupt and Miles' character didn't really evolve much compared to the start of the movie.

- Seeing Miles finally open up to a mom who had the wrong eye color was CRAZY. As soon as I saw she had green eyes I knew he's in the Spidey-less universe.

- Hot take: the chase scene with all the spider people was underwhelming. They went full on Ready Player One with trying to fit in as many easter eggs as possible instead of doing a better, more interesting sequence.

- I'm SO glad Part 3 is coming in 10 months and we don't have to wait another 5 years for it.",2023-06-02

"I know this will get buried under the 7300+ (and counting) comments, but I can't even be mad about the amount of discussion happening - this film was fantastic and deserves the love. 

So, if for no other reason than I GOTTA get this thought on paper: The meta-narrative being told through this movie is executed so well.

Not unlike NWH, or a million other movies featuring time travel and/or alternate timelines, we're getting a big dose of 'determinism bad'. I'm fine with this theme recurring often in fiction, but it can get tired. The way it's presented in Across the Spiderverse feels pretty fresh, particularly because the concept is introduced subtly through Spot early in the film (""The Spot?) before Miguel ushers in the existential, high-concept version. 

Spot is as interesting a villain as he is (initially) hapless; He is driven by the same toxic traits (ego, vengefulness, misplaced rage, self-pity) as any number of other villains but seems 1) to have no particular desire to be criminal, and is even apologetic about it, and 2) seems to be fully aware of the trajectory he is personally on. Spot accepts, if not embraces, the idea that he is Spider-Man's nemesis. He does not reference predestination specifically, but it's clear that Spot no longer believes that he is in control of his destiny - and, dammit, if he's doomed to be in Spider-Man's rogues gallery, he's gonna be the best villain he can be. Unlike villains who lack the self awareness to see themselves as the bad guy, Spot is smart enough to know that he's on the pipeline to super-villainy and just... doesn't see a way off. 

In this way Spot is a mirror to Miles, who we see, somewhat naively, trying to have it all, as though he is in TOTAL control ('in a hurry to grow up', as his father puts it), and failing pretty badly in some important but not yet immediately disastrous ways (mediocre Spider-Manning, messing up his relationship with his parents). However, *Miguel* mirrors Spot - or, rather, puts an gigantic lens on Spot's apparent philosophy as if to say 'YES. Not only is it inevitable, but your rise to villainy is actually a *function of reality*'.

It's fitting that the movie cliffhangs with Miles coming face to face with his, nearly literal, mirror. I suspect the resolution in Beyond will bridge the gap between the free will that Miles takes for granted re: his seeming ignorance to just how much of his life is outside of his control, and the, nearly useless, deterministic thinking which drives Spot's actions - as well as Miguel's. His zealotry for the inevitable is so severe that it actually takes the form of prejudice against Miles. I mean, this movie is using age-old time travel/ determinism tropes to talk about racism; that's not super subtle, but it's very interesting!",2023-06-05
"I liked how the Spot was the bagel guy from the first one.

Also unpopular opinion but I thought the animation got a little too frantic and and made the movie feel unnecessary chaotic at certain points. Like some
parts of the opening battle there is just a lot going on.",2023-06-02
"That was an immensely enjoyable movie, I'm still digesting it in my brain so I can't do more complex/organized words about it but it was good. Shpidaman is good.

I feel really bad for Miguel O'hara, it is tough being the only straight man Spiderman. If I had to guess, we're going to get an extremely good moment next movie where Miguel does a quip and everyone claps, or something.

Lastly, including live action people in this movie is going to open up a whole can of worms. I'm looking at Toei and Disney right now, Emissary of Hell Spiderman as a straight up toku hero would make millions of people happy, I know it'd make me happy.

I wasn't really plugged into the Spidey comics at the time but like, the bit where Miguel gets on Miles' case about not deserving to be a Spiderman really reminds me of the old forum I used to go to in the late 00s/early 10s when people who followed the ultimate universe were pissed that he was replacing Ultimate Spidey. fun to think about.",2023-06-02
"I don't get the critique that there isn't a resolute ending to this film. Yeah, Miles' story and the conflict with Miguel/Prowler Miles isn't resolved, but this is clearly Gwen's film. It opens on her and she's the one who finishes her character arc through the film, and at the end she has this huge climactic reunion with her father before gathering the other Spideys to go help Miles. I feel like that's as good an ending as you can get for a Part One film, and I know a lot of people didn't know it was a two parter going into it but I don't think they really hid that in marketing or anything (granted, it wasn't explicitly advertised as such either). I feel like a lot of this ""bad ending"" critique is reactionary from the feeling of seeing ""to be continued"" and getting sad about waiting another year, which is super understandable! But my take is that, give it another year or two and people will look back on the ending of this film and find it a lot better, even without taking into context the next film that will almost certainly pay off what was set up here.",2023-06-02
"Overall I really enjoyed it, although I still probably prefer Into due to it's simplicity. That being said, I'll hold off until Beyond comes out since it is kinda hard to rate only half of a movie.

Some assorted thoughts:

Honestly didn't expect Gwen to essentially be the protagonist here, I wonder if that'll also carry over to Beyond.

I was a bit miffed at all the live action Spider-Man pandering, but then Lord/Miller effectively told a story about how Marvel and Sony have done fuck all with Spider-Man in the last few decades and I came right back on board lol. That being said, I'll even admit I cracked a bit of a grin when Donald Glover made an appearance.

Evangelion Peni Parker? I'm SOLD.

Anyone notice Prowler Miles in Spot's flashback to the alternate universe spider? That's definitely gonna come into play.",2023-06-02
"I haven't seen it said, but the amount of representation in this movie is pretty crazy. I mean, they had a wheelchair Spiderman for goodness sake! That's definitely worth praise!",2023-06-02
"I don't buy Miles-42 as a villain. I have a feeling it's going to be a red herring. 

The question this movie asks is: should you fight against destiny, aka ""canon,"" to save lives?
  
Miguel, our antagonist, thinks the answer is unequivocally ""no."" Anything that disrupts canon is an anomaly that has the potential to destroy the multiverse. From his view, Earth-42 was doomed the instant its spider failed to create the right Spider-Man. Canon must be preserved at all costs.  

But I don't think that's the viewpoint of the movie. Both Miles and Gwen, our protagonists, arrive at the opposite conclusion, you *should* try to change things for the better, you *should* try to save the lives that canon has deemed sacrificial. Canon is not an undeniable force, it can and should be challenged.  

I think a beautiful way to expand on that theme would be to demonstrate that Earth-42 doesn't *need* Spider-Man to have heroes. Did becoming Spider-Man, the canonical hero, force our Miles to become a hero? Or would he have become a hero anyways?  

While Aaron-42 and Miles-42 certainly *seem* to be performing villainous acts at the end of this film, the movie intentionally leaves out so much context. They are clearly planning a heist, as Aaron notes they have to avoid security, but who's to say they're not stealing from Oscorp, or Kingpin, or an evil tech billionaire version of Peter Parker?  

And even though they beat up and chain up our Miles, what else were they supposed to do? A random doppelganger showed up on the night of their big plan, spouting nonsense about being from another universe!   

Add all that to the caring relationship they both have with Rio, plus the loving portrait of the deceased Jeff Davis, and I think we have a more complex character than ""evil Miles"" on our hands. 

In other words, I don't think Gwen's ""band"" is the only team-up teased at the end of this movie.",2023-06-02

"Anyone notice how Earth-42 Mile Morales rolled his ""r"" when saying ""Morales?"" Makes sense because his dad died in this universe so he would pick up more of his mom's accent",2023-06-05
"I remember this being touted as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"" and I was hoping they had since amended it to include an actual ending. Even though we know Gwen's team will obviously save Miles and right the multiverse, it just doesn't stand on its own as a satisfying movie (this sentiment was echoed by other people I heard discussing it in the restroom).

Aside from that though, I thought the movie was fucking fantastic. The colors, the style, the humor; I had forgotten how much of a live-action comic book the first movie felt like. So many great cameos too (Donald Glover as Prowler and that Asian shopkeeper from Venom), plus archival footage of both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield (I guess Tom Holland's version doesn't ""exist"" anymore, post-No Way Home). Plus it was cool to see LEGO and video game versions making appearances. I lost count of how many different Spider-people were introduced here, but it was all very entertaining and involving (especially the Gwen/Miles relationship angle).

But sadly, all I can remember right now is that unfinished ending.",2023-06-02

"It feels good to get two great comic book movies back to back with Guardians 3 and this. In my opinion the genre has been on faulty ground as we got a string of mediocrity and downright awful movies with Morbius, Doctor Strange 2, Thor Love and Thunder, Black Adam, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Ant-Man 3 and Shazam Fury Of The Gods. 

So it’s good to see that good comic book movies can still be made and that the genre isn’t dying at least not yet.

"I think that Miguel is actually...not a Spider. 

There's a scene--or maybe a couple--where he is injecting some sort of fluid in his system. Also, his eyes grow from amber to red at different sequences, and they're red when he gets more unhinged--venom causing an emotional imbalace? Plus, in the callback scene, why would alternate Miguel's Spider die randomly by a gunshot? We've seen all kinds of Spiders dodge a variety of fast-moving objects so this doesn't really make sense. I think alternate Miguel was never a Spider, just as 2099 is not a true Spider. And he has claws instead of a regular Spider, which I think is because he can't climb naturally--he doesn't get the full skill range of a Spider. (Miles even says this when he sees the claws--""you're sure you're an actual Spiderman?""--or something similar.) 

Story-beat-wise it's fluid with a couple of things--Gwen's Peter wanting to be a Spider, and having such a personal, emotional vendetta against Miles. He's angry that Miles got ""chosen"" when he wasn't supposed to be, and he (Miguel) didn't. I think there's more to Miguel's story, he forced a Spider arc for himself by creating some sort of venom that helps him hone Spider abilities, that it wasn't a chance spider at all that bit him. 

I'll be honest, I haven't read the comics and know virtually nothing about any of these characters outside of the movies, I'm coming in as a relatively new superhero fan. I just absolutely adore the Spiderverse movies and enjoy picking apart and thinking about the clever story beats they've developed. You can prove me completely wrong by providing some comic lore, I just predict this will come up in Beyond as part of Miguel's arc.",2023-06-04

"This creative team does a REALLY good job of portraying Miles’s Spider-Man. Miles has a traditional family dynamic which differentiates him from other Spider-People. And the way his family operates feels so authentic. His family feels so tied to his community but he also feels like I did at his age. Kind of tired of having to make appearances with all the uncles and aunties who show up at whatever event his parents were throwing at their house that weekend. But he also deeply appreciates what his parents have given him and is trying to balance their expectations with his desires. 

Another thing I really love is that Miles truly embodies what it means to BE Spider-Man amongst the army of Spiders. Canon be damned. If there is someone whose life he can save, he’s going to do it. The other Spiders have, logically, concluded that some people just can’t be saved. In fact, the death of certain individuals appears to be a fixed point for every Spider. While they all have come to accept that reality as a force that molds each Spider towards becoming the hero they’re meant to be, Miles throws that whole notion out the water. He can’t sit by if he knows someone can be saved.

So what if he was never meant to be Spider-Man? So what if he’s the first anomaly? HE’S SPIDER-MAN NOW. And he will do both.

At first, I thought maybe this is just how it has to be with two-part movies.

"Absolutely stunning movie. I went to a 4DX viewing of the movie on Sunday morning at 9.40am and the hall was packed. I've been to other movies in this particular time slot and it's usually just a handful of people - Little Mermaid, for example, had a total of 5 people in the audience, including myself - but not this time.

The Spider-verse movies so far evoke a sense of wonder which I haven't had since the first phase of MCU. Visually, it's absolutely beautifully made and this artistic direction evokes the comic feel of the first one, but even better. I really wish it would come to streaming services sooner so I can just pause and rewatch everything - first for the animation styles and second for the easter eggs. 

As an Indian, Pavitr Prabhakar made me so fucking happy - especially with the nitpicks about ""chai tea"" and ""naan bread"". Too real, man. Glad to see he'll be returning in Beyond the Spider-verse. Same thing with Hobie; he was perfect. Spot being the dude hit with the bagel is fucking hilarious and I do love how they slowly ramp him up as a villain.

My one big con with this one - it ends on a cliffhanger. While it does a fantastic job of setting up for the next movie and I believe all this worldbuilding was needed, the way that ended left me unsatisfied. I was expecting a full closure like in the first movie, but then I looked at the run time and realised this was going to be a ""To Be Continued"" kind of deal. The realisation that Miles had ended up in the wrong dimension was quite crazy tho ngl. I also really like that the Earth-42 Miles has a stronger Spanish accent when pronouncing ""Morales"" + the subtle distinctions between both dimensions. 

Overall, I feel this is better served when looked at as the conclusion of Gwen's story arc than Miles' - because that is done well. She opens and closes the movie for a reason. But I think many people - including myself - expected this to be Miles' story, so there is a level of dissatisfaction with the lack of closure. 

Imo, this places more pressure on ""Beyond the Spider-verse"" to be perfect in order for the buildup in ""Across the Spider-verse"" to pay off. Standalone, I certainly do like the emotional beats Across covers - especially about parenthood because Rio's monologue hit hard - but that means little unless it pays off in Beyond.

Overall, 9/10. I plan to rewatch it over the weekend, so I'll see how I feel about it after knowing how it ends.",2023-06-06

Same thing with Naan bread. We all know bread means a loaf of bread and not the flat thing that looks like a tortilla. So we used the word Naan bread.

You gotta love the layers in that scene where Rio talks to Miles. Rio knew that Miles lied when she asked him to tell the truth on why he always flakes but he came up with some excuse. Rio always knew that Miles had a secret life. She is very worried about him living this secret but when he came up with that excuse, she felt just how much that secret meant to him. Miles of course is very much capable of fending for himself in this secret life, but to Rio, he's still just a little boy who's trying to say he can take care of himself. However, when she felt the weight of Miles' excuse just to hide his secret, she finally decides to just let Miles do whatever he wants but with some advice. That is, if he is gonna continue living that secret, at least be careful, ""take care of my little boy"" - little boy being the boy she knows Miles as. She is talking to Miles' secret life - as Spider-Man. Rio is literally talking to Spider-Man to protect Miles. Although her speech also functions as a sort of parental advice for a son who stubbornly insists to be independent, in this context, it can be seen as her pleading to the actual, albeit secret identity of Miles - a very capable person, to please protect Miles, a precious son whom she doesn't want to be hurt.

There was a scene on the rooftop where Miles is trying to tell his mom that hes Spiderman, and Miles says, ""mom, I'm..."" and  someone in the audience yelled out ""gay"" and people laughed.

"its mind blowing and the best Spider-Man story ever told on screen from a die hard Spider-Man fan. It’s literally going to force the animation medium to step up its game permanently. Pushes the boundaries of the way you can tell stories through filmmaking. Yep, the most visually insane and off the walls thing I’ve ever seen. Wildly original. I want to take every second of that movie and frame it and put in a museum. There’s a neat little reference to a Wes Anderson film in here too",2023-06-02
"I feel like the entire Web of Canon moment was a big highlight, beyond seeing live action footage of Amazing Spider Man which definitely shocked me, it was definitely the most Meta Spider-Man thing we've seen in a long time. 

But I think what's most interesting about it is that Into the Spider Verse was all about Miles becoming just like all of these other Spider Men and the whole point that Spider Man could be anyone. If that film was about the everyman nature of Spiderman, this is about the pre-determination and common ""threads"" of being Spiderman plus arguably the formulaic nature of Spider Man stories always involving tragic backstories and eventual tragic loss. It's an interesting opposite. Yes Spider Man can be anyone, but the same specific shit is gonna happen to him no matter what, in every universe.",2023-06-02
"Perfect, spectacular. Felt like a comic book, right to the end.

I just wish they had ended on “this isn’t my universe” and gwen with “he’s in the wrong universe” and cut to a to be continued, with Miles Prowler in the mid credit scene. That would have been such a way to draw viewers back and also be true to comic book cliffhangers",2023-06-02
"I came in trying to manage my expectations, I did not need it to be as good as the first film which I loved, just 'good enough' so to speak. The fact that I am leaving unsure as to whether I prefer this one or the first pretty much speaks for itself.

I was blown away.

The action set-pieces throughout were incredible, loved the little prologue with Gwen and the more focus she gets throughout the film. She goes through a journey and has a lot of growth herself, really liked the scenes between her and her dad, you can see the parallels between herself and Miles

I like that it's a more serious tone of story with bigger stakes, while there is plenty of humour especially early on, the film starts to shift, just like how Spot shifts from the 'villain of the week' joke to someone who become an extremely serious threat. It was executed very well. Not a villain but Miguel is a compelling antagonist in this film, you can completely understand where he's coming from and I am very interested to see what he'll do in the next film.

So many details I could gush about, a lot of the callbacks in jokes from the first film: with making it seem like Jeff was about to jump into the portal, immediate cut to him running down the stairs. The fact that Miles did albeit inadvertently cause the Spiderman in his universe to die, if you watch the first film back or you've seen it countless times like me, Miles does delay Spiderman enough to the point that the Prowler is able to catch up with him and prevent the collider shut down, the fact that was incorporated as a key plot element is crazy, love that.

The theme of destiny, determinism or 'canon' is an interesting one. If Miles was not supposed to become Spiderman then was his father just destined to die albeit it would've been under the watch of Chris Pine Spiderman? I suppose that would also work.

Need to recover after seeing it 4DX which helped ramp up the action scenes even further. Probably going to see it again soon in Imax.",2023-06-02

I can't say I'm thrilled that this was a surprise two parter but to be honest the movie was so fucking good that I'm not even mad. I can't wait for the home media release so I can go through individual scenes to spot (pun intended) all the hidden details.

Also, am I crazy, or did Gwen murder Ben Reilly? She pulls him into her universe but takes his watch, he's going to glitch until he dies, right?",2023-06-08

"So I realized something when I remembered the scene with The Spot's first appearance. When Miles asked if he was wearing a costume, he said that ""It's all human skin"" or something like that. 

So he wasn't just naked (not at first but later when they began fighting), but he also lost his genitals? Correct me if I'm wrong but he had nothing inbetween his legs and I checked the images from the movie so did the mutation just made him that way? How does the guy even go to the bathroom?

I know that this is a different version of The Spot than from the comics which I know but is this true?",2023-06-11
"I’ve seen this movie twice now, and I feel like… honestly it’s just… this was something special.

Forget the actual rap music for a moment, the original score is just fantastic. The opera coming in when Vulture sees the city at the start has to be one of my favourite scenes, it gives me chills. And Miguel and Gwen and Prowler, all of them have Leitmotif’s that are just amazing. 

Visually this movie is outstanding, every frame is something to admire. And every universe is different, even if only subtly. Gwen’s universe was easily the most beautiful to me.

I liked the first movie, don’t get me wrong. I did really like Spider-verse 1, and when a sequel was announced I was happy and ready to see it. But this - I genuinely love this movie. 

Maybe it’s because it’s just out at a better time in my life, I’m happier, less depressed, or maybe something tonally or how the movie comes together just strikes more of a chord with me. But I adore this movie, I’d happily watch it *again*. I rate it above the first.",2023-06-11
New to Reddit. Couldn’t get the movie out of my head it was so good. I loved Spot since I didn’t think he would actually be important.

"It’s one of those movies you have to see more than once to truly appreciate it. That ending hits like a bucket of cold water, but on a second viewing, when you know it’s coming, it’s a much better experience. Plus you can pick up on all the details you missed on the first viewing. 

Some people say the music was a downgrade from the first, and while the music wasn’t as iconic as the first (Sunflower, What’s Up Danger, Prowler theme), it’s still fucking good. (Spot theme, Miguel theme, and Gwen theme, Mona Lisa, and the ending song).

Also, the movie being so character focused can only happen because it's a part one. I know some people will feel like that's a detriment,but I view it in the same vein as Infinity War or Empire Strikes Back.

It's the hero's lowest point before the satisfying conclusion. Overall, I just love this movie, straight upgrade of the first one in all aspects.  It explores so much about the Spider-Man mythos and bakes the ""I saw and I clapped"" stuff directly into the narrative.
Lastly, personal bias, but all the Spider-Gwen focus got me so hyped! It's as much her movie as it is Miles', and I love that.",2023-06-02

"Did anyone else notice like a theme of mentor and mentee. In the previous movie we saw all the spiders mentor miles and help him become his own Spider-Man like the fat Peter showed him the practical stuff. The perfect Peter was more on the philosophical Gwen taught him to be more acrobatic etc. 

Then in this movie there’s like a switch all of a sudden miles is shown to be the perfect philosophical mentor like he is the guide that every Spider-Man should aim for always trying to protect everyone no matter the cost. 

Then we have Gwen in this movie she’s a scared and alone kid who doesn’t know how to process her emotions and trauma properly so she’s lashing out on her father and ex-band mates if instead of Miguel and Jess coming out of the portal we had Peter B.Parker the perfect Peter I think he would have told Gwen to confront her trauma talk about it with her father and not run away as that is the worse thing you can do as it will pile up and all come crashing down like we see later in the movie. But instead she gets Jess who taught her how to practically become a better spiderwomen but not how to process her feeling and mature emotionally. 
 
We can see the duality of a mentor how if the mentor isn’t good it could lead the person astray and they not even know it until it’s too late as you trust a mentor whole heartedly. But if you can find someone who can guide you back onto the right path then you can start to improve, so I think the next movie is gonna be about how miles will ‘mentor’(used loosely) the whole spider verse on how they should strive to protect everyone and sacrifice no one.",2023-06-10

1. I don’t like how all of the Spider-People are so quick to side with Miguel. Spider-Man is a hero that stands-up for the little guy and always tries to save every person. I don’t believe that hundreds of Spider-People would let uncles and police captains die just because they are “canon events”. Spider-Man is the type of person that would save Captain Morales while also finding a way to stop a multiversal collapse. It doesn’t make sense to me that Miles is the only Spider-Person to hold this ideology. That goes against everything we know about the character across all iterations.
2. Peter B Parker was a standout for me in ITSV and I’m not the biggest fan that he’s been reduced to a comic relief character. I understand that he’s happy now, but I don’t like that he doesn’t take the situation seriously and doesn’t show a lot of concern for Miles’ plight or the possibility of a multiversal collapse. I also cringed when Peter implied that Miles would feel better about his dad dying if he just held Mayday. Does Peter not remember how heart-wrenching it was to lose his own father figure (Uncle Ben)? Having a baby doesn't magically erase that pain. Weirdly out of character.",2023-06-04

"I guess I'm definitely in the minority, but I'm a little shocked at the glowing reception this movie is getting. I was so disappointed because the first movie is incredible.

Visually it was STUNNING like wow wow wow. Music was excellent. But I felt the script was a **mess.**

This one abandoned the 3 act structure to jam pack as much as possible in its runtime. I kept waiting for a climax that never happened. I get that it's a part 1 so not everything will be resolved, but the runtime was devoted more to fanservice than telling a concise plot. It didn't need to be over 2 hours, honestly.

Instead, it felt more like a Marvel Studios movie this time. You got gratuitous moments devoted to fanservice, you got characters making unnatural ""cool superhero poses"" (I don't remember this being a thing in the first movie, so why now?), and you've got a plot bogged down with explanations and over-long dramatic scenes that wrecked the pacing throughout.

Uncle Aaron can finally get Miles the battle pass,2023-06-02
"My two big takeaways:

1. Spider-Gwen's origin is the best AU Marvel has done in like 20 years. I loved that they kept it pretty much the same in the first movie but to actually see it in full here was worth the ticket price by itself. I imagine that Jason Latour and Robbie Rodriguez... are not getting paid for this, but I hope they enjoyed it anyway. She was the core of this movie. 

2. Right now between the ending of No Way Home and the current arc of the Amazing Spider-Man comic, Marvel has never been as hardline on the stance that Spider-Man is popular because of how sad he is. His current book is so bad, so antithetical to what fans of the character actually want, that it's unfavorably colored online perception of *American comics in general.* So to see this movie so loudly protest this treatment of one of the three biggest characters in the medium is really profound.",2023-06-02
"Wow I don't usually get blown away by movies much anymore but this was (pardon the pun) Amazing!

This was the most ""live action"" feeling animated movie I can remember. 

I can't think of many (especially western) animated movies that have so many great long scenes of character driven dialogue. 

When you look back on this 2 and a half hour movie, there weren't too many action set pieces. The ones we got were of course brilliantly animated,  particularly fight scenes with the spot where the angle changes are all accounted for.

I could sit here praising this movie for hours, without a doubt the best ""part one"" film I've seen in years. Even though it ends of a cliffhanger I still felt more than satisfied, and very excited for Beyond the Spiderverse!

The animation in this movie is the best I've ever seen and probably will ever see (until part 3 comes out I guess). This is not an exaggeration, this movie is STUNNING. And so creative, and layered, and even like super experimental? This takes the superhero movie genre and completely turns it on its head. The action scenes are fun and thrilling, the dramatic scenes are really great and nuanced, the characters fleshed out and interesting. Hell, the music is even good and that was my biggest complaint about the first one! It literally surpasses the first film in every way.

I have some minor gripes but nothing that really killed my enjoyment. I think a lot of the humour was great but some of the jokes were a little lame (chai tea was a banger though). But people were dying laughing in the theatre so could've been just me. As well, like anytime there's a movie with multiverses and like time travel and all that shit, there's going to be a ton of plot holes. So much so they made the villain a literal plot hole lol. I think if you can just turn your brain off for a second and just remember you're watching an animated movie about spider-man the plot holes won't bug you as much—still bugged me just a little. And like this story isn't complete so it's hard to gauge it as a whole just yet, but if they keep it the same pace as this movie I think it could be one of the best trilogies of the modern era.

It really is a love letter to the character of Spider-Man from the history, to the character's place in popular culture. I like thematically how it talked about the bond between parent and child and felt it was really moving and made sense with the character of Spider-Man. There's been so many superhero and multi-verse movies at this point and it's really hard to do something that is not only original but just fucking good, and worth seeing. This movie accomplishes that almost Herculean feat. The ending really surprised me cause I went int completely blind, my whole theatre was so into it! Will go down as a classic. As I was leaving the theatre and waiting for my friend to get out of the bathroom I saw a kid, probably around 9 or 10 come out of the movie and he was just looking at the poster art in awe. This is what it's all about.

"Saw the new mix of this today, which I’m dubbing the “I’m Going Home Cut”. 

Honestly I never had problems with the sound in my theaters the previous two times I watched this.

Between this and EEAAO it has been a big couple of years for bagels,2023-06-20
"I love how it started off differently with Gwen's story in a different universe instead of Miles. Her universe is seen more differently with Miles with a lot more colors in it. Not sure if it was the way her universe was, a way of showing her emotions, or maybe both. Heart wrenching to see Gwen and her father's reaction to her identity reveal.

With Miles, I like how they showed him struggling to balance his school/home life and superhero stuff as he becomes distant from family and arrives late to any important event. Even when he has a family celebration to attend to, he never seems to catch a break. Just goes to show being a superhero can be stressful as a teen! It's however very impressive that he has straight A's in almost all of his classes with everything going on.

With what the writers did with Spot, it's brilliant that they made a minor side character from the first film to be a secondary antagonist to Miles. I had to go back to rewatch that scene and Spot was indeed only shown in the first film when Miles threw the bagel at his face while escaping the facility! 

It was great that Miles brought up men's mental health in a somewhat casual way with his dad. Pretty comical when his father keeps dismissing it. He must be thinking ""who do you think you are?""  

Aw when Gwen went down the rooftop and Miles put his head down.. I personally felt that. For sure almost cried. I found it cute that they were both seemingly jealous about another potential mate.

The first plot twist when all the Spider people appeared around the group while Miles was talking.. about how everyone had the power to reverse a tragic loss, but understandable that they had to let things be to not disrupt the canon events. That was such a tense scene. I really liked that Spider B Parker came back and is still trying to mentor Miles like a father figure. From his introduction, he noticed he definetly went through a character development to being more happy and laid back. Having a kid for sure changed him for the better as a person.  

That second plot twist when Miles went to the wrong universe to find his uncle is the one alive and not his dad. With that color scheme, it's almost something out of a Telltale game like ""The Wolf Among Us!"" That final cliffhanger with Miles as the Prowler was nothing but amazing. 

Such a great film. That 'glitchy' soundtrack is still there and fire!",2023-06-21
What a film. For a spider geek like myself it hit so many amazing points it was just everything. Off for a cup of chai tea to celebrate how good it was,2023-06-25
"Miles from Earth-42 is the coolest fucking villain I've seen in a long while. 

With the way it ended, it sucks that we may have to wait until '25 to get the third film (not unless Sony hires a fuck-ton of animators to meet a 2024 release).",2023-07-01
"Overall I liked it, but it’s got some issues for me.

First of all, the audio mixing in many areas was just straight-up bad. I missed so many lines simply because I couldn’t hear it over the music + action.

While the colors and styles are great, it’s way too much. Spider-Punk and vulture were hard to keep track of. And I found Gwen’s scenes way too much and too blatant (She sad, so make da room bloo.) It took away from what should be really impactful scenes. Something like Wolfwalkers handled these kinds of backgrounds much better imo. I know my dad will hate this movie’s animation because he already didn’t like the first’s that much (he doesn’t care for the CG/2D, heavy stylization mix showing up more and more.) And this is Into’s animation on copious amounts of coke.

A lot of the action was also hard to keep track of. Especially in fight scenes or when introducing new characters. At times it makes it hard to tell what’s happening or where my eye’s supposed to hang out. And a lot of the fight choreography felt sloppy/rushed because of it. Like, in Mile’s first fight with Spot a swan gets involved somehow and I have no clue where it came from despite keeping my eyes on the screen the whole time. There are moments where the audience needs to rest or reorientate but the movie doesn’t provide them.

Which brings me to my next point: the story’s pacing is _really_ off. It switches from “way to fast” to “snail’s pace. While I loved the visuals of it, most of the time at the rooftop party could’ve been cut completely to give us more time with Pavtir (who just disappears in the last half of the movie) and/or Hobie, or even to just add a bit more breathing room for fight scenes.

Or even to further flesh out Gwen’s arc. which honestly feels so half-baked compared to Miles’ in the first one. I get the argument that this is supposed to be Gwen’s movie. But, there’s so much focus on Miles that it really doesn’t feel like it.

Finally, this movie really struggles with “middle-of-the-trilogy” syndrome where it just feels like connective tissue so Into and Beyond make sense. (I’ve seen this a lot in books where the middle one is kinda necessary but you overall feel like you wasted your time.) Part of it is because it doesn’t feel as tightly written as Into, but also because it just introduces a bunch of stuff without really doing anything with them while also ending on that massive cliffhanger. I honestly don’t see myself rewatching this one over-and-over like I have with Into the Spiderverse. Imo, even if you’re making a trilogy, each movie/book should work as a self-contained story that weaves itself into the greater whole.

In conclusion: I did like this movie, but it’s got some significant flaws that drag the experience down quite a bit for me. I feel like it’s been greatly overhyped.",2023-07-10
"I'm someone who is just, like, so goddamn sick of superhero movies. I know that's not a common opinion around these parts, especially not for anyone who went to see this movie. But I saw Into the Spiderverse and thought it was quite good, and the reviews were excellent also, so even though I have had it up to my fucking ears in superhero movies, I decided to give this a go.

And HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. What a fucking incredible movie. I think it might be the best animated movie I've ever seen.

What I loved about it was that they clearly made this movie for the fun and thrill of making movies. Everything was just endlessly creative and inventive, from the incredibly dynamic art style to the witty dialogue and the cleverly plotted storyline that still made the whole multiverse concept feel fresh rather than beaten to death like it is in the MCU already...it must have been a tremendous joy to be involved in making that film, and it was just as much a joy for me to watch it too.

A very interesting choice to have the art at Gwen's apartment so secondary, making the interaction between her and her dad become the greater point of emphasis. I love how the colors ran during the latter part of the movie when she returned home, like a symbol of how the structure of her life is starting to fall apart and remake itself somehow. When a movie starts doing these little things behind the scenes to enhance the storytelling like that, you know you've got a really amazing movie on your hands.

And yes, I'll go ahead and say it: it's refreshing to see a movie with a black lead and a black family and have that be completely normalized and not be patting themselves on the back for having a diverse lead for their movie either. It's just nice to see.

For real, what's an animated movie that's better than this? The Lion King? Eh, that's a movie for kids! This is a movie for EVERYBODY goddamnit!

The next movie I plan on seeing is Mission Impossible so that's going to be two movies in a row where the movie doesn't actually end lol",2023-07-24
"6/10

I liked where the story was heading but felt it was drawn out. Didn't know until the end that it was a cash grab cliffhanger movie so that's why it was drawn out. I don't mind story that gets split but don't feel what we got in this part was satisfying enough. What was the climax?  The stupid chase scene where it showed how ridiculous the the other spider-men were?

Loved the cameo from all source materials but wish they did more than just one liners or background characters. Loved Gwen and Mile's characters. Don't know if we're suppose to sympathize with Miguel but he's just annoying on screen. Peter B is still great. I'd love a movie with Peter B and May.

Beautiful movie but I'd just wait until next year and watch both movies at the same time.",2023-06-02
"I have nothing against ""part 1"" movies. Some of my favorite movies are just ""part one"". Or two of three. What I didn't like was how the end of this otherwise fantastic movie just completely negates any of the earned emotional payoff it was building towards. Yeah it's cool how he built up the courage to finally tell someone he's Spider-Man. But then it just doesn't matter. I feel like they could have handled it being the first of two movies in a much cleaner way. Give him some emotional payoff, and then the sequel hook. Don't go and fake out the audience like that. It's a little cruel and cheapens the whole ending of the movie for me. Especially after how well they handled Gwen right before it.

Otherwise I think it's a solid 4/5. A great sequel that builds on what made the original great, with tons of fun dialogue, references, and character building moments. It's just such a shame that they had to structure the two-parter cliffhanger in this way. Compare it to, say, The Empire Strikes Back or even The Matrix Reloaded. Both don't finish the story, both obviously set up sequels. They feel so much better realized in that department however. They feel relatively respectful of the audience and give them something that surprises them, but doesn't feel too cheap. Well maybe someone feels that way about Reloaded but I remember liking that movie's ending quite a bit in spite of the cliffhanger. Anyway.

Yeah it's good. Also I don't really like the whole ""lol guess those people are not true fans for not knowing it was a two-parter"" vibe I'm getting from some of these comments. Some of you need to grow up.",2023-06-02
"thought the movie was joking when it ended

It's 180 minutes long and ends with a to be continued what feels like 20 minutes from the typical ending where a villain shoots a laser into the sky

"It was really good. The way they pushed the animation was great. A standout was Gwen's universe. It wasn't super flashy but the flat pastel-y look to everything and how the backdrops started just being abstract colors in the scenes with her and her dad was really cool.

Only real gripe was that it went on for like 20 minutes after the climax just to set up part 2. I knew it was part 1 of 2 so I just kept expecting credits any moment but it kept going. But it was still good stuff even then.

Also one of the most excited crowds I've seen in a bit. There was a full house before my showing and I had a full house too. And everyone clapped at the end, something I haven't seen in a while.

"semi coherent thoughts about Miles's character writing:

I remember seeing the official poster for this months back and thinking, ""cool, but kind of a bummer that Miles's story always needs to share so much screen space with other spider-people"". Except, that's the biggest non issue because they keep using the multiverse as a fantastic narrative tool for Miles's character growth. The first movie used all these spider-people to help Miles become Spider-Man, the second one's entering metanarrative territory wherein it's using the history of Spider-Man as a character to explore what type of Spider-Man does Miles get to be. How much of an original can you be when there are versions out there who've lost entire universes for being *too* different? (which is in a way culminating into that old question of 'exactly how miserable does Spider-Man need to be'). The spider-people in this one are also not helping him realize his potential, for the large part they're in fact holding him back (the space elevator chase I felt was a parallel to the leap of faith scene from the first one, except this time he makes that jump for himself, not for the mask) — Spider-Man The Character's narrative expectations are holding him back. They've already told this story so many times and you think you know the rest, so how do you make Miles stand out? You maybe let him break the canon (how exactly, idk. but Beyond is definitely going there). You let him spread his wings. There's a blank page waiting on that guidance counselor's desk back at Visions Academy and Miles will return and fill it out himself.",2023-06-05

My only grip was that they didn't finish the climactic fight before the cliffhanger and now we have to wait a year to see what happens next.

Someone at my screening yelled ""THAT'S ITTTTT!?!?!?!"" at the end and honestly that was me internally.",2023-06-11
"This is easily a top-3 Spidey movie of all time. 

Words cannot describe how **good** the animation is, it's stunning, gorgeous, sublime, breathtaking... and the story is so good - it's fun but sprinkled with tragedy. They put so much love into this film and it shows. Daniel Pemberton's score is even better (which was already great in Into the Spider-verse) this time around and it's sooooo gooood! Also, Spider-Gwen rocks, and my future wife Hailee Steinfeld kills it with her performance (everybody had great performances, actually). I hope we get a Spider-Gwen game like Imsoniac's Spidey one day.

I read that there was a cliffhanger so as soon as Miles escaped from Miguel I thought that it was gonna end there, so I'm grateful that they took the time to set up what was gonna come next.

The indian spiderman was really well done, i thought it would be just for americans but i was amazed to see references that only south asians would get like the zomato board (more like a in movie sponsorship ig), being angry about chai tea and naan bread, mentioning the british stealing things and the joke about indian gwen’s dad thanking miles as if he was helped him with moving things rather than saving his life (no matter what you do south asian parents will always thank you like that lol)",2023-06-12

A lot of the plot was set up for the next movie which made it quite tedious once it became obvious this is just part 1.

"My personal Positives and Negatives for this movie

Positives:
-Fantastic Visuals
-Good character development for Miles and I liked getting more Gwen backstory
-Miguel O'Hara was a really cool character and I want to know more about him. I know he's kinda the villain but I really liked him a lot
-Very funny dialouge
-Any screen time with Peter B Parker is a treasure
-Spot guy was amazing and probably my favorite character and I love his 2D animated segments
-Lego Spiderman

Negatives:
-While the movie did have a long run time, there honestly felt like way too much stuff packed into it. There were several locations I wanted to see more of and take my time around it. I felt like the Spidey HQ stuff could have been a majority of the second half. I would have to explore that area and some of the characters a bit more.
-Again, while the Visuals were stunning as usual, it did get a bit overwhelming at times, so it was hard to see what was going on. I like Spider Punks newspaper/sketchy quality, but it was a bit distracting that there were so many color flashes in scenes where it was just them talking. 
-Same for Gwen's universe. It kinda seemed like there were times where they didn't know what direction they wanted to go with it. In the scenes where she's arguing with her father there were many shots where the entire color palette would change on a whim, which looks cool in some shots but seemed unfocused in others
-Some of the action scenes needed to be tightened. There was often so much happening on the screen with many different color effects that it was hard to follow what was going on. Also the editing seemed a bit weird in some places
-Not sure if it was my theaters fault but the voices were very low in some scenes, especially the opening monolog. Also characters talked over each other a lot which made it hard to understand some jokes.
-Finally this is just my own weird opinion but for a movie that heavily focuses on family and the struggles of parenting,.its kinda weird that Peter B took his small BABY into many life threatening situations and Pregnant Spider woman definitely should not have been in the field if she was that far along. I know its a cartoon but still




Maybe I'm just a killjoy or maybe I just need to see the movie again.......but I did not enjoy this one as much as the last one. I did like it, I had fun watching the cameos and seeing the different art styles, but overall it fell flat to me in many aspects",2023-06-02
[deleted],2023-06-02
Ngl this felt really all over the place for me. Nowhere near as tight as the first,2023-06-02
"Okay, now that I let it sink in a bit, I had several issues with this movie. Keep in mind the first movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time and basically my second favorite animated movie behind Inside Out.

The first half suffered from serious pacing issues. There was about 45 minutes of family drama, followed by a 30 minute or so sequence in India where proper stakes of the movie still havnt been properly established, and then another 20 minutes in the Spider Society before the movie really gets going. I think the movie lacked focus and it makes for a lack of story structure. I get this is a Part 1 but you still need a beginning middle and end. Infinity War is a perfect example of giving you a movie that stands on its own and as a Part 1. This movie gave us a beginning, with bits and pieces of a middle and bits and pieces of an end (kind of?).

This is gonna sound like absolute blasphemy but I also think the visuals and easter eggs were a little over-indulgent. It felt like the movie knew it was taking a while to get to the point so it spammed beautiful and colorful visuals and cameos at you to help ease the wait. The first struck a balance of insane visuals but letting you sink your teeth into the story that i think this movie really lacked.

The good? A lot of the incredible visuals DID work. The voice acting and soundtrack were phenomenal, Miles remains an endearing character that I will root for every day of the week and I thoroughly enjoyed the meta message that Spiderman stories should be allowed to divert from their canon and create something new (didnt catch that until I came on reddit I will admit). 

I still liked the movie, but I am disappointed. Hoping Part 2 elevates things a bit",2023-06-02

"The ending kinda ruined it for me. I loved everything until the end, and the more I think about it and the worse it gets.

I understand the script ran long, but move pieces around once you decide to make 2 movies out of it, so that part 1 can somehow stand on its own. Fast X pulled the same shit, and while that was a bad movie all around, at least it had a set piece to finish the movie. Across the Spider-verse didn't even give us that! >!They even teased us with the new villains and the amazing punch by his uncle... and then it ends there... a superhero movie ending just before a fight, fucking baffling man!!<

It seems we are in the minority, but I still don't get that its being praised so much more than the first one. Not only for the story, but also the animation was a bit more coherent and restrained in the first, while still being amazing and over-the-top. Here it seems they have leaned a bit too much on the fever dream part. Still loved it though, my main problem is the non-ending.",2023-06-02
anyone else think its no where near as gd as the first?,2023-06-03
"I must have been in a bad mood.

To start I could barely hear the voices for everything in the spider Gwen universe. So bad that I complained and the waiter guy (dine in theater) just said ""yeah a lot of people have been saying that, don't worry"" WTH. 

Everything after the intro and until the end of the Miguel fight was excellent. Although the trope where everyone knows the big secret but refuses to tell the audience and main character and just force you to wait the entire movie is perhaps least favorite. 

The ""twist"" was so predictable that I was very confused why they drew the reveal out so long. They showed the universe he was going to in big flashy letters so it wasn't even a twist. but then took like 20 minutes before his mom revealed it. It felt like we were running out of movie to have a whole nother fight scene. Add on the fact that we got our checks (normally given right before the end of the movie), and suddenly I realized that the movie wasn't going to even have a conclusion. I was disappointed by this so I just submitted and waited for it to end. But then there were almost a dozen face zoom ins and music climaxes that I thought for sure was going to be the end. Started driving me up the wall. By the end I was fuming. 

I rewatch the first one regularly because of how tightly knit and cohesive of a movie it is. This felt like a great movie that ended up being too long so they panicked and cut the last 45 minutes and replaced it with some very sloppy hacked together mess. 

I look forward to the next one, but I doubt I'll ever look back fondly on this one.",2023-06-04
"Way overhyped. The movie was slow, it dragged just so they could sell a third, and then nonstop in moments, lord and miller tried bringing that meta and humor from the Lego movies but it doesn’t work here, it takes the seriousness away. Though I loved the animation and shots, it fell flat on actual story and character advancement.",2023-06-05
"Is the same shit of the trailer but in tedious 2hours…

Alot of boring talking and talking and talking with giant heads and infinite city backgrounds…

The ending drags for almost half and hour

"I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion but I disliked this movie.  It was too long and bloated and filled with fan service. They could have easily edited it down by 30-45 minutes.  There's so much exposition and set-up for zero payoff.  The cliff hanger ending was frustrating after sitting through all that dialogue.  And now this movie has just set-up another cinematic universe. 

 I loved the first movie because it told a self contained story.  This movie was just setting up more movies.  If you can't tell a complete story in three hours you're doing it wrong.  And yes my theater had the same audio issues as everyone else where you couldn't hear half the dialogue anyways.  

The whole movie was a muddled garbled mess of swapping who they wanted the main character to be.  If they wanted a Spider Gwen movie just make a Spider Gwen movie, I'd have watched that.  But the constant shuffle between Gwen and Miles just left the entire movie unfocused.  

And on a personal note the stupid Spider therapy scene was in bad taste and mocks something many of us who are either in or need therapy.  It wasn't funny it was insulting.",2023-06-05

"My favorite superhero movie of all time. Beating Logan and Dark Knight. It has so much heart. This movie made Miles leave the shadow of Peter Parker, the character development he has makes it so he is THE GUY and you see that during the train confrontation with Miguel.

Multiple art style was amazing, especially with the emotional scene with Gwen,looked like paint bleeding  on the canvas. Animators flexing since the start with the Vulture scene. The emotional beats were paid off in full and then some. The diversity and culture in all the spidey was so awesome to see. The music was so fucking good especially if you are a hiphop fan (album drops tonight). Most of the jokes hit and were funny.

Oscar Isaac ate every scene he was in, his 2099 spidey felt genuine and menacing. Hailee and Shameik emotional scene hit it out the park.

The Spot story were good and he actually felt like a real threat at the end, and the animation they did with the inky tendrils really did it for me. Had 2 movies to develop Miles relationship with his dad unlike Uncle Ben dying usually in the first 20minutes so when they reveal his fate, it hit harder.

Forming the Spidey team with Gwen and the alternate universe without a Spiderman and Miles as Prowler was interesting, can’t wait to see it explored and how the fight or the resolution of that scene in the 3rd movie.

The Easter egg with Spiderman ps4 being played by Ganke. Every single cameo of Spiderman ranging from comics to live action movies. Also the pay off if you are a Spiderman fan that watched every single animated series. MCU prowler Easter egg. Loved PlayStation Spidey Easter egg wished he had lines and a role. Spectacular was awesome. Didn’t see 1990s Spidey TAS but saw the Unlimited one. Think I saw a quick scene of the Japanese Spidey. Wanted to see a Symbiote Spidey or Superior. Wish they all had more involvement but the current line up that was mainly used were good enough. Spider Punk and Miles were fucking cool. 

Criticism would be that there wasn’t enough, it’s only part 1 of 2, so it’s valid but the story was already so stuffed that I was satisfied.
I didn’t see how they coulda top the first movie but they did, now I don’t know how they are gonna beat this movie. 

BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE. BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE.

"Honestly this movie could've been great I wouldn't know but cause the dialogue was so low in the mix I could only hear half of it. So I didn't fully understand the stakes or hear the jokes.

"10000/10. Not just the greatest spider-man movie ever, one of the greatest animated works ever created. Emotional, powerful, beautiful, amazing character depth and realistic relationships. The work they put into the different animation styles was insane.

Love how much focus on Miles and his parents’ relationship we got as well as Gwen and her dad. The inclusion of tobey, Andrew and the MCU stuff… and the video game stuff.. everything was just perfect for me.

Movie really felt like a comic book brought to life and I love that they had the actual comics that certain storylines and events were borrowed from. The Easter egg video for this is going to be so fun to watch.

Metro soundtrack not only lives up to the original, but surpasses it. That ending scene with Gwen putting her own team together and heading into the portal… goosebumps.

In a movie full of amazing set pieces, I loved the college counselor scenes the most.",2023-06-02

"I doubt I'll be in the minority with this, but I fucking LOVED this movie

&#x200B;

First of all, it's difficult ot overstate just how visually gorgeous it is. I was hoping to see it in 3D, but either they didn't format it for 3D or they weren't offering it in my area (San Diego, which would be weird). Either way, just in standard, the art and graphics were stunning. I'd recommend watching it for that alone.

&#x200B;

The story itself was cohesive, solid, and engaging. I wasn't bored a single minute I was in the theater. There was practically no fluff, and the pacing was better than I've seen in ""superhero"" movies in a while. 

&#x200B;

I don't think the original soundtrack for this one was as good as the first, which is why I think it was used less than the first one was. But that's just my opinion, and it was still good. 

&#x200B;

Was cool to hear Daniel Kaluuya speak in something close to his actual accent in a movie for once LOL. And his character was the lowkey MVP of the film. Hoping he makes an appearance in ""Beyond""

&#x200B;

All in all, I have nothing bad to say about this film. Maybe I will after some reflection nd nitpicking. But for now, easy 10/10, and I don't just throw those around on my amateur ratings either. This was honestly a GOOD film, and I cannot recommend it enough. Easily the most fun I've had in a theater thus far this year.",2023-06-02
I swear I thought the movie was going to end at least 5 times before it actually did,2023-06-03
I absolutely loved I don’t mind the year wait (compared to what? 4 years?) although I was dying to see Noir and the tease got me bad! This could potentially be such an incredible trilogy like really up there! One thing I’m worried about and hope they don’t do…. is I’ve been seeing people mention for beyond that they think it’ll end and connect in to the MCU/Live Action. I really don’t want them trying to do this ruining how good these movies are. Not saying there shouldn’t be a live action Miles but….,2023-06-03

"Can we just talk about how beautifully the family dynamics are portrayed in this film? Damn.

Miles’s balcony scene with his mom and Gwen’s resolution scene with her dad; to me, these were at the heart of the movie.

Really nice stuff with Peter as a father, too. 

Gwen’s dad talking about “this parenting stuff is a big mystery,” that line felt like a real wonderful underpinning for how parenting functions in this film.",2023-06-03
Easily one of the best sequels I’ve seen. Didn’t quite reach the heights of Into the Spiderverse for me but was still great. Loved the arcs for Miles and Gwen and Spot is a great villain. Was a bit bummed that Peter B was sidelined and sometimes all the amazing visuals could get a bit overwhelming. But as far as “Part 1” movies go it was great and a worthy sequel even if it didn’t emotionally resonate with me the same way the first movie did (the Leap of Faith sequence is still one of my all times faves).,2023-06-03

Still very excited for Beyond though. Also just give me a separate Spider-Man 2099 movie in this animation style",2023-06-04

"Just realized something after seeing the movie last night.

The go-home machine, it scans anomalies and sends them back to their correct universe. Here it sends Miles to the wrong universe because he was bit by a spider from a different universe. But the machine is able to correctly identify entities which were not bit by a spider, so should it have been able to scan Miles and detect that he was from Earth 1606 instead of 42? Maybe there’s a special exception for Spider-People where it prioritizes the spider which bit them?

Not sure if anyone has thought of this, I’m sure someone else has. But it would be pretty funny if Miles got sent to the wrong universe because whoever coded the machine forgot to check for the one in a trillion edge case that could never realistically happen. Until it did. That’s peak software engineering.",2023-06-04
"Beautiful animation, the scene with Miles fleeing from all the other Spider-people was the highlight for me (all the action and jokes thrown into that scene were nuts).

&#x200B;

I prefer the first movie, though.  I think the Miles story takes just a little too long to get going in this one, and there was a little too much focus on his family drama.  We don't learn about the ""canon events"" plot until a little bit into the second hour, which is where the movie really takes off, until it grinds to a halt in the last 15 minutes for the sake of sequel setup.",2023-06-04
"Absolutely loved the movie except for the sound. Our cinema sounded like it was
Recorded in mono, with all sound coming from the centre front channel. Couldn’t hear a lot of the dialogue and it sounded tin-like and echoey. This was in a Dolby Atmos V-Max cinema",2023-06-05
"I really enjoyed this for the most part. The animation was absolutely stunning. The first movie looks amazing, but I  think the animators somehow managed to make the visuals for this movie look even greater. I really enjoyed getting to actually see more dimensions, since the first movie was pretty much confined to Miles’s dimension. I liked the way the first movie experimented with different animation styles, but I think this movie blew the first one out of the water in that regard. I also enjoyed the characters a great deal. I liked that Gwen was sort of a co-protagonist alongside Miles. I think Miles’s actions drive a lot of the plot, but the character arc and development was really more focused on Gwen this time around. Gwen reconciling with her father was one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie. Hopefully we’ll get some good resolution on Miles defining what it means to be Spider-Man on his own terms in the next movie. 

If I had to give one criticism for the movie I think it felt like an incomplete story. I don’t think cliffhangers are a bad thing, but the second half of this movie very much felt like setup for the next movie. It doesn’t really stand on its own as a relatively emotionally complete package. I think how well this movie will hold up very much depends on how well the third movie turns out.",2023-06-05
"It's a very good movie but I am going to mention a few criticisms:

-as amazing as the visuals are, a few too many cuts and it's hard to focus a bit in many scenes. I wish I could pause this movie and just admire it

-a bit too much happening. They already introduced spot as the big bad, then there's Miguel and then again at the end they introduce yet another one.

-overall I think the previous one is a better movie, but can't wait to watch this again",2023-06-05
"This is a very good movie with masterclass animation. I thought Puss in Boots would have the best animation in a movie I’ve seen for a long time, but this outdid it. The two hour run time felt short too.


One thing I will add that doesn’t have to do with the movie itself is that I need to stop seeing anything Marvel on opening weekend. Aside from not being a huge fan of crowds, these movies bring out all the people with zero theater etiquette, which theater etiquette is usually as simple as “sit down and be quiet”. Obviously you can react to jokes and stuff or just whisper little quips you have to your friends, but I was next to a group where someone was flat out responding to lines, using their phone, laughing during obviously serious moments in the movie, and just in general not being respectful of the people around them. Unless you’re like 10 or under, it shouldn’t be hard to just watch the movie and react when everyone else does.",2023-06-05
Pure cinema. I was tripping the whole time.,2023-06-05
Feel like I’m the only one that thought Miguel stole the show? God he was awesome,2023-06-05
"My favorite part of the movie is that it is not another villain of the week plot as almost all superhero movies are. It has The Spot, and it even makes a few jokes about him being a “villain of the week”, but the plot isn’t really about him as he is just a small part of a much larger story.

I feel that ever since Batman 1989 almost every comic book / superhero movie has had a villain centric plot. Batman ‘89 with The Joker, Batman Returns with Penguin and Catwoman, Batman Forever with Two Face and The Riddler, Batman & Robin with Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, Raimi Spider-Man with Green Goblin, Spider-Man 2 with Doc Ock, Spider-Man 3 with Hobgoblin, Sandman AND Venom. All of the MCU and DCEU movies and even the Nolan and Reeves Batman movies follow this same formula. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does with The Kingpin as well.

The only comic book movies I can think of that don’t fall into this trap are the X-Men movies as they tend to focus more on the social commentary about mutants and humans trying to coexist together, although they still sometimes follow this formula as well (e.g. X-Men: Apocalypse).

It was just so refreshing to see a comic book movie deviate from this formula and deliver a unique and thematic story that didn’t revolve around a villain trying to get revenge or take over / destroy the world.

And don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy a story that is villain centric if done well. Avengers Infinity War was amazing and is almost entirely about the villain. But the formula has gotten tired and stale over the decades and I loved that this movie decided to take a risk and do something different.",2023-06-05
Does anybody know the song that’s playing after Miles gets grounded when he is in his room,2023-06-06
"My theory about how the next film will handle the Canon Events issue

It's already been heavily foreshadowed twice in ATS.  

So the main thing is that Canon events must happen otherwise the structure of the Spiderverse will collapse and therefore erase a universe, or incursion.  But with that said, we've seen ""events"" gotten prevented twice with the inclusion of *multiple Spider-persons* helping out.  The helicopter save in Spider-Gwen's universe and holding up of a building in Mubahattan.  Of course it showed that multiple Spider-People came to fix the hole that threatened to swallow up the universe.  But that is the point.  

What do Spiders Build?  Webs...they build the web, they write the story....not the other way around.  Miguel is so concerned about the shape of the web, he isn't thinking how he could build a new one, a stronger one.  Obviously he cannot do it alone...he hasn't been doing it alone.  But looking at how the Spider-people had helped with saving people from death in the two events, by combining the webs and building something stronger than a helicopter or a an entire science building, who's to say that they cannot use their abilities to build a stronger web for the Spiderverse?  If there is a weakness in the web because of a lack of a canon event, then we just need more Spiders to build webs to hold that part together.",2023-06-07

"I have some questions. Does every Spidey in the Spider Society know about their future canon events? If so, are they just sitting around waiting for those events to happen? Kind of out of character for them. If the usual time theory is correct, not actively participating in the canon events should also alter the timeline, which sounds risky. This brings me to my next question.

If Cap Morales is supposed to die, he should die regardless of Miles being there, as long as no other Spider-Men interferes the event (eg: Captain Singh's event). In every other canon event, the respective Spider-Men have actively participated in trying to save the victims. Why was Miles being stopped from saving his dad?",2023-06-11

Spoilers for Logan (2017)

I was dreading that Miles' confession to his ""mom"" revealing himself to being Spider-Man was paralleled to Xavier's when he shares with ""Logan"" feeling like he didn't deserve ""the most perfect night I've had in a very long time,"" and then the clone of Logan kills him.

"At first, I didn't like that they merged live-action and animated stuff together, it kind of broke my immersion a bit but when i thought about it a little bit more it was a natural extension of mixing these multiple styles together. nice way of making people think that a spider-verse story is happening right now in another universe and its in a animated form. Like each universe of the spider-verse is its own animated style so ours would be an live action one.",2023-06-13
"Just watched it a second time today with my nephew. He loved it and won't stop quoting Spider-punk.

I noticed more things to appreciate in this movie, and dislike a bit compared to the first.

In the first there's more static scenes that hold on a scene, while this one is quite full and active. That's not a bad thing since it was just absolutely amazing.

Compared to the first movie, this one has more on-screen action and personality. For my eyes, a bit too much to look around at.

The music seemed louder too. First time watching I didn't have a problem hearing the characters talking, but this time I felt like I could barely hear what was said, but, my nephew had no problems. 

I had a greater appreciation for the Villains in this movie.

Spot really came off as a victim. I mean he is. He lost so much because of the Spiderverse, and he hasn't even hurt anyone.

Miguel was badass, and seemed different. He can't wall crawl, can he? I noticed he wallcrawled with his claws instead of sticking to things.

The end villain reveals were intimidating. Scarier than compared to their counterparts.

"When Gwen steals Scarlet Spider's watch and crushes it in her hand, she's visibly confirming her rejection of the Spider Society and Miguel's indoctrination.

She still has a long way to go to repair the damage she did to her friendship with Miles and to his heart. But at least she's started.

And though I understand that Miles has every reason to be furious with her, I hope he eventually sees how genuinely she desires to make things right with him.

There was an instance where there appeared to be guidelines surrounding Miguel's head during his first appearance in the Spider Society building. Some on Twitter have also noticed that Lyla's actions in one scene are different depending on where and when the film was viewed. Are there other oddities supporting the two film theory?",2023-06-22

"Miles saved 5 spider-people's lives, saved them from glitching out of existence. And how did 3 of them repay him?

Shunned him. Lied to him. Told him to let his father die. And 2 of them - 1 his mentor, 1 the girl he loves - then joined an army to chase him down and lock him up. Gwen even had the cheek to look Jeff in the eye, with Miles and Rio present, while she was ready to damn him to death.

Even if Gwen, Peter, and Peni did believe Miles was an anomaly, the *bloody least* they owed him was telling him the truth.

So yes, I badly, badly hope Miles reconciles with Gwen, Peter B, and Peni. And yes, I feel downright awful for what Gwen's been through. And I'm so glad that she's finally figured out how badly she's hurt Miles, and has started to make things right again.

"Although the movie had some cool moments, it  failed to catch my attention like its predecessor. I was disappointed in it and I liked the first movie better.",2023-09-08
"This is very much a minority opinion so I just want to connect with a few people here who might have had the same qualms with the movie as me. 

From a technical and audio-visual standpoint this movie is absolutely mind-blowing. Every frame is gorgeous and the sheer level of technical and artistic skill on display is staggering and that alone sets this movie miles(hehe) ahead of anything else in the comic book genre. And thats what will keep me coming back to this film.  (\*\*\*Spoilers ahead\*\*\*)

But I do think there is one huge aspect that soured the experience for me: The fact that this is half a movie. Maybe I was a bit aloof to some of the promotional material of the film but I had no clue that this is was supposed to be the Part 1 of 2 movies. I really wish I had known this was the case so that I would then have been able to better with the movie conscious that things wouldn't be resolved. But fundamentally I don't think this needed to be split up into two movies, especially in the way that it was done. It's 2023 and the movie industry is no stranger to two-parter films, but such two-parters usually come at the end of a series of films, ala Marvel's Infinity War and Endgame, the last two Harry Potter films and even the mindless Fast and Furious films. While each of these have been successful to varying degrees, my position is that they as such 'earn' the two-parter by creating blockbuster after blockbuster movie that fleshes out the universe that they are creating to a good degree before diving into the two-parter. But this is absolutely not the case with the movie. I feel like the second movie in this Spiderverse series should have been a complete chapter that put our characters through new trials and tribulations but also resolved them and closed out most loops by the end, much the way the first film(which is an absolute masterpiece imo) did. Instead I found the movie to be extremely unsatisfying to the point that it reduced my enjoyment of what came before. 

This half-a-movie syndrome is what most affected my enjoyment of the film, but aggravated a few other aspects that I did not like as much. Aside from the beautiful heart-to-heart between Miles and his mother early on, it sort of became clear retroactively that scenes were being dragged on with the kind of quippy humour we associate with Lord and Miller productions to pad the runtime. Later on just as The Spot becomes a formidable villain he suddenly disappears, so that now more than halfway through this movie the Spider-people society can be introduced and quickly revealed to be new antagonists to Miles' spiderman. In the last few minutes, there is the amazing reveal that Miles is in an alternate universe captured by a prowler version of himself, which while interesting, happens too late to meaningfully contribute to this story, leaving all the good stuff with regard to this scenario for the next film. Because of all this it felt unsatisfying. This is surprising because even when franchises do opt for two-parters there is some semblance of chapter-wise breakdown of the overall story that makes each half amazing but this movie spends so much time delaying its actual plot and introduces new antagonists later and later into its runtime that it ultimately only promises the next great film instead of being one. While all the above has to do with Miles, I found Gwen's arc weirdly disappointing in that her father's reversal from wanting to arrest her at the beginning to turning in his badge, was not adequately explored and I do feel they should have spent more time there establishing how that reversal came about. As we see Gwen rounding out her rag-tag team of Spiderpeople at the end, instead of feeling like this was a tight-knit team that had each other's back and will pose a considerable challenge to Miles' foes, it did not sit well with me. The great characters we see in Into The Spiderverse are only revisited at the very end here, which seems like a lost opportunity to have had a few scenes with them early on in this movie as well, so that we see them interact with each other and get the sense that the closing team-up is earned. 

Because I was surprised how little I enjoyed the overall story of the film I went back to the first film to understand if it was really the same. But instead, the first one is equally beautifully animated and scored, and importantly well-paced and plotted with amazing character interactions, a lot of which while funny, never become the kind of non-stop quippy mess that much of the first half of this second movie reduces to. 

But clearly most people have enjoyed this film more than the original so most do not share my opinion of the film, so maybe I just did not vibe with my first viewing of this movie. I will try watching it again at a later date and I hope that it ends up being more enjoyable (before the next movie comes out though, because I am still excited for it; hopeful that all these unfinished storylines will be fantastically concluded!)",2023-06-08
"Just walked out. Collection of random thoughts:

--My eyes hurt. Like, literal, physical pain. About the halfway mark I knew it was going to be bad and I had to start closing them for 10-20 seconds every now and then. I'm prone to eye strain, and this was brutal.

--Visually, it's the most remarkable movie maybe ... ever? It's also dialed to 11 basically the entire time. And that's a lot.

--This feels like a Spider-Gwen movie maybe more than a Miles Morales movie. She has the more interesting storyline (Miles's often feels redundant to the prior entry and also to other Spider-Man films), she's a smarter and more interesting character, and her powerset isn't absurd. Miles is basically the guy from the Infamous video game series, Spider-Man, and also [INSERT INVISIBLE SUPER-HERO HERE]. It feels like he's a walking cheat code a lot of the time.

--The imagination and creativity on display is just mind-bending. Every few minutes something else that brought a smile to my face and then something even more amazing would happen, and then they would top it a few minutes later. T-Rex Spider-Man? Bollywood Manhattan? Awesome.

--Miguel O'Hara isn't a Spider-Man, is he? They allude to that when they say he isn't funny, and Spider-Man is supposed to be funny. I'm guessing that he's a Man-Spider and the injections are to keep him from turning. I would have liked to have seen more from him because I totally identified with his frustration. They're trying to save worlds and people are bringing children with them, going off-mission and doing random shit, and acting like little jackasses.

--I really, really wish they'd made Miles 17 instead of 15. He is too young for the way he's behaving, the storylines they're giving him ... everything. Him being on the cusp of turning 18 and struggling with the transition to college would make so much more sense for that ""what's your future hold"" academic advisor meeting and make the romance and rebellion storylines feel a bit more organic. This was a bit of an issue in the first one, but it's a lot here. There are a few points where he says, ""I'm not a kid,"" ... yeah, you fucking are. You totally are a child. A fifteen year old is a freshman in high school. My son is a freshman in high school, he and all his classmates are children.

--Imagine for a moment that they cut the Gwen Stacey intro and instead gave us a kaleidoscopic 60 second flashback during the scene when she reveals that she knew what would happen to Miles's parents. It would have hid her motivation from the audience, cut 15 minutes off a running time that could use some trimming, gotten rid of some pointless action sequences, camouflaged the Miguel reveal until he lowers down on that slow-moving throne thing, and we would have lost nothing. It would have also made it feel more like Miles's film, though maybe they don't mean for it to be.

--We could have used a lot fewer scenes of angst with Miles and his parents. So. Many. Repetitive. Angst. Moments. JFC.

--The reveal that Miles is in the wrong universe was telegraphed from the beginning and I still didn't see it coming. What a moment. Fucking awesome. The cliffhanger worked like gangbusters for me ... perhaps in part because my eyes couldn't take anymore.

--I cannot praise the character design and look of the worlds enough. Phenomenal. Chef's Kiss. The Prowler and Uncle Aaron at the end are a study in lighting and color and framing to create menace in familiar, non-world-shattering-disco-ball environs. The chase scene with the Spider-Men is simply one of the most astounding, unbelievable film sequences of all time.

--So, I wasn't the hugest fan of the ""Naw, I'm gonna do my own thing,"" in the first film, and I could have done without them bringing that line back.  It feels flippant given what the character had just learned (frantic desperation seems like it would suit the mood better).

--I saw a trailer for an Indiana Jones film starring Harrison Ford and a superhero movie with Michael Keaton as Batman before Across The Spider-verse. I'm twelve again.",2023-06-03
"I think I get what the canon means, it means in Spidey life at least there's 2 tragedy. The loss of the loved one by getting killed (Loss), and the loss of another loved ones by their battle against the enemy (Sacrifice).   
\-in Tobey it's his uncle getting shot (Loss) and Harry getting stabbed (sacrifice),

\-in Garfield it's Gwen (Loss) and Capt. Stacy (Sacrifice against lizard)

\-In Tom, I think it's May (Loss) and MJ (sacrifice (what is getting forgotten if not living death), this is debatable nonetheless (maybe soon in spiderman 4))(Can Tony sacrifice count? Nahhh, not sure bout that)

\-In Miles it's his Uncle Aaron death (Loss), and someone close to him sacrificing his lives (His Dad, His Mom, Gwen? Peter B? Spot redemption??? Ganke Lmao?)",2023-06-02
"I usually don't like when movies plan for a sequel. But in this case it works. I'm going to watch Into the Spiderverse, Across The Spiderverse and then Beyond The Spiderverse back-to-back-to-back.

"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?

The visuals were amazing, sounds were so on point but, anything else?
In terms of narrative and story, what did it tell? They mesmerized us with flawless animations yet they seem like nothing to tell.

If it was a couple of short movies that had little connection between them, I could like it. I believe I just watched a 3.5-hour-long trailer which makes no sense at all. 

Don't we all know to be a Spiderman that requires great sacrifices? Don't we know Spiderman tries to catch their life but couldn't because of the villains on their roads? Don't we know to learn |changing the timeline could cause bad things? What did this movie give me?

I don't accept ""it is the first part of the series"", that doesn't give the right of being a video that introduces a bunch of characters in fancy animations.

Many scenes don't fit in with the entire movie. Why did I watch the university conflicts between Miles and his family, does that contribute to the movie?
 The spot was a desperate person who tried to steal an atm from a market and 5 minutes later he became a nemesis of spider man, how come? Just How did you change your ultimate goal to rob a market to becoming a villain by just jumping across a few streets? 
Why the hell, didn't Miles become invisible while being chased by all the other spiderman? The movie showed that the invisibility of Miles doesn't trigger the spider-sense of Gwen. 
How logical to webbing to stop|slow down a collapsing building, and try to save people? There must be many casualties yet no one talks about them except the young girl and the sheriff they saved. 
What is the reason|science or what ever behind of atom collider with Spot? If he needs an energy only, why did he used that?

All these make me unable to believe the world they created and can't make me love the movie. I wonder your thoughts and challenge you to make me believe I am wrong.",2023-06-06
"The plot was too meta for my liking. Instead of a Spider-Man movie, we got a movie about spider men spidermenning, IFKWIM. 

Too many repeated family drama shit. Could have done less of those scenes. Miles’ problem felt like nothing burger and was unable to feel sympathetic. Oh your parents don’t want you to go to Princeton, what a sad life. 

Oh you want to come out as Spider-Man to your parents, what a tragedy.

Compare miles’ problems with what happened to spot. Bro literally fucked up spot’s life and kept joking about it. And didn’t realise what a tragedy that was. 

Spot was a fun tragic character but they didn’t give him the seriousness it deserved, while they kept showing the family problems of Miles’ as if that is the worst thing that could happen in the spider universe.",2023-06-06
"Anyone else felt like this was originally supposed to be a Disney+ limited series? Each segment was roughly 20 minutes long and felt like a bunch of smaller stories within a larger framework.

Edit: Since people seem to think I’m downing the movie and not just pointing out how it’s structured. 

Ep 1 Catching up with Gwen and seeing her backstory.  
Ep 2 Catching up with Miles.  
Ep 3 Miles and Gwen catch up in New York.  
Ep 4 Miles follows Gwen into Mumbatten.  
Ep 5 Gwen takes Miles Into the spider verse… lobby. Miles escapes.  
Ep 6 Miles ends up in the wrong universe. Gwen reconciles with her dad. Then assembles the team.  

Each segment is roughly 15-20 minutes long. 

Just like a tv show. 

And they each have a well defined Beginning, Middle and End.

It’s not bad. It’s just different from the typical three act structure of most movies.",2023-06-06
The ending was very unsatisfying. Idc if it’s a two parter. Give some sort of conclusion like infinity war did,2023-06-02
What the actual f+CK how is Hollywood getting away with this bs 2part film without advertising it before hand as a multipart cinematic experience. Cutting off the story right as it was getting to act 3 so anticlimactic. I can't express how furious I am at this.,2023-06-03
"Overall I liked it but for a Spider-Verse movie I was a little put off by their disinterest in honouring the past

Spectacular Spider-Man! …..gets 1 line of dialogue

Scarlet Spider! …..is a complete joke

Spider-Man ‘67! ….breaks his back?

Spider-Man Unlimited! …no lines

Hopefully the next movie expands on some of this as I have a tough time believing EVERY version of Spider-Man from EVERY Spider-Man cartoon would go along with the “predestination” thing.  For the record I think 2099 is right over Miles but Peter (especially Spectacular!) is such an optimist I feel he’d act the same as Miles. I didn’t like every version of Peter acting like 2099’s chumps. I’m glad they portrayed Peter B. Parker as conflicted and showed that he actually watched the death of a world or else it would have bordered on character assassination.

I really like Miles, but you don’t need to beat down every version of Peter to prop him up.

It was a great movie for Miles and Gwen though. In fact I thought the stuff between Gwen and Captain Stacy was what hit the hardest emotionally.

Also, I’m uncomfortable that Peter is taking his toddler to fights and that Jessica Drew is doing deadly motorcycle stuns pregnant. That kinda stuff lowers the stakes and makes it all seem goofy. The different tones the movie takes on is like an emotional whiplash. Laugh, cry, laugh, cry

I did love how they incorporated all the live-action stuff though (Donald Glover!) and scenes like the ASM 90 scene are what this needed more of. I think I’ll like the next one better with the full-spider team back.

Animation was spectacular (ha!) as always",2023-06-02

"
-	Art style was obviously turned up to eleven and luckily it worked. I think the mixed art styles helped with that by adding some variety, but even the Studio montage was so damn pretty
-	On that note, shout out to Regal for having red ghosting around the top of white objects. Really added to the effects… in all seriousness though it wasn’t noticeable once everything else got rolling so I didn’t really care because everything else looked so damn good. 
-	I liked the “incomplete drawn “ buildings instead of construction infrastructure on the background skyline. 
-	In the same vein, The Spot had construction lines showing (idk what those are actually called) until he “Leveled Up”. They were still sometimes visible once was upgraded so maybe that shows he still has a final evolution form
-	Miguel also had construction lines showing. Maybe he’s due for another transformation?
-	Speaking of Miguel, it wasn’t that surprising that he turned out to be an antagonist considering his suit [actually had a skull on it](https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU)… but there wasn’t like a big reveal he was going to be the antagonist as if to shock us so it wasn’t annoying. It was a slow ramp up so it worked. 
-	For a middle part in a trilogy the story was good. I dig the “canon” plot device. Works perfectly with a multiverse concept. Excited to see how they resolve it in the third half. My prediction is something to do with Miles creating a “new canon” 
-	If they don’t fuck the third one up this will be the best super hero trilogy of all time (please be nice /r/RaimiMemes)
-	I’m sure most people will do a better job pointing out the references than I will, so I’ll just say the Lego world would have made me roll my eyes if the writers didn’t have that connection so they get a pass, and Donald Glover cameo gets a pass because I love him 
-	God it was so beautiful. I know I already said that but I just wanted to say again.
-	Hyundai product placements were jarring and stupid. Was that a metaphor for captitalism too? That product placements are stupid? Also I like how B.K. Went out of their way to food dye a burger irl and it doesn’t even match the off color burger they had in the movie. 
-	EDIT: Forgot to mention I thought of while in the theaters. I liked that they didn’t subtitle the Spanish lines. I didn’t understand most of them as a monolingual, but it worked because it felt like “yeah only bilinguals will get this” and that’s the point 


Way to go Sony Animation. You did a good job. Please don’t fuck the third one up, and maybe can we get some 1.43:1 scenes for imax?",2023-06-02
"Man, everyone is so in love with this movie I feel like a wet blanket thinking it was incredibly disappointing.

FWIW, the animation was beautiful (loved the different world styles like Renaissance Sketch Vulture, Spider-Punk, etc.) and there were a lot of fun characters (looking at Hobie and The Spot here). I don't want to diminish the amazing work the artists put in this film.

But.

It was so dense and cluttered with-
- convoluted-yet-uninteresting plot points,
- too many characters with their own arcs who the movie didn't actually have room to develop,
- too much high-concept moral debates that didn't feel grounded in actual tangible events in the story,
- too much meta stuff that feels tonally dissonant from what the first movie was like,
- too much escalated emotional tension that was so intense but went by too fast to fully land,
- disasters like in Pavitr Prabhakar's universe that felt like they should have world-shaking fallout wrt the Breaking Canon stuff but there wasn't enough time to actually see the consequences,
- a villain who the story seemed to revolve around without enough interaction and screen presence midway through to keep him feeling relevant, despite being one of the most interesting and engaging characters in the movie,
- honestly boring fanservice referencing other movies because MCU corporate culture has infected everything and media can no longer stop being a snake eating its own tail,
- a twist at the end that sidelined the entire story AGAIN, with Evil Miles feeling like he belonged in a separate movie with a separate story,
- a To Be Continued that didn't need to happen if they just cut out the million complications that derailed the movie in the first place...

I dunno, it was a neat movie, but once they started talking about Canon Events I just started to check out a bit. Reminded me of the Homestuck sequel. I felt bad for all the little kids watching the movie who would have *no earthly idea* what was going on halfway through except that Miguel was mean.

I dunno! I'm happy for the people who enjoyed this one, but for me too many things dragged it down.",2023-06-05
"I'ma post my own review lol l. I'm a comic fan and really enjoyed the 1st one but this felt painfully average.  A 5/10 in my book is a average film. This was a 6/10 just good. It was a popcorn movie similar to the FAST movies.



This movie makes no sense. Once it passes to dimensions hopping.

Pros
The 1st 45 minutes are *GREAT* Gwen stuff & Miles pre universe jumping

Visuals 10/10

Music solid

Spot was good.

Cameos were good.

Cons.
We treating Spiderman like a drone now. MF Peter Parker is now letting people die because of fate. Now if your gonna argue well it was actually Miguel ... They still followed him.

No other iterations of Miles are anywhere in the film. Which makes no sense since PS4 Peter is here.

The pacing after Miles jump is terrible.

If this is you're 1st time seeing Miguel. I'm sorry this iteration is terrible. If you like him good for you but as a comic fan this was embarrassing.

The jokes are needed because it's a spiderman film. But most didn't land it genuinely felt like children humor which was pretty disappointing because the 1st film was great even though it's jokes didn't work for me they felt more natural. This time around no one in my theater laughed at most of the jokes.

Replace Miguel with Superior and I couldve bought his aggression twords miles.
 
I could probably add more but if someone ask I will Elaborate",2023-06-05
Was a great movie until that ending and it drags it down overall for me. It’s a great set up and will work great once part 2 comes out but there is no climax to the movie. After the Spider-Men fight it’s all set up. Miguel is definitely going to be miles rival not the hole guy but I hope prowler miles is evil and they don’t pull some bs out of their ass where it was a misunderstanding. It should of gone the Dune 1 route where they still have the climactic fight but have another major event to end the movie on.,2023-06-02

"Oscar Isaac was outstanding as Miguel O'Hara.  The anger, despair, frustration with Miles in their last scene together was visceral.

Also, great timing releasing this on Pride month.  So many will relate to the difficulty of coming out to their family, and the fear of what will happen if they do.",2023-06-03
"Mixed thoughts on this one. Absolutely beautiful film with some incredible moments and accompanied by an amazing soundtrack. But doesn't live up to the original for me.

The 1st was one of my favourite films *ever*, but unfortunately it feels like they've fucked the pacing by splitting the film into 2 parts. I still enjoyed it but it felt too ""meta"" and too all over the place to flesh out anything at all in the story; quite exhausting imo.A few new interesting characters were introduced but character building was poor and mostly consisted of them injecting witty one liners into random scenes, hence why it feels like the film relies on the more interesting characters from the first film.And are we really supposed to believe Miles' managed to escape from thousands of spiderman's (spidermen?) who also have much more experience than him? Plot armour seemed just a *little too strong.*

Best parts of it for me was when the story slowed down and kept it in Miles Morales' universe; I loved watching the dynamic between Miles and his parents and Gwen's interactions with them.

Its a shame they didn't let this sequel stand on its own two feet like the 1st film and instead relies too much on the 3rd film coming. I don't mind there being a part 2 but it needed a proper conclusion and it could've done it whilst still leaving it on a cliffhanger for the 3rd.

*Also did anyone else think the dialogue was too quiet at the start of the film? Audio was weird. And who else noticed his roommate playing the spiderman game, haha.*",2023-06-04
I'm really interested to see how they handle Prowler Miles. It would be an interesting juxtaposition between Miles being raised by his Father and Miles being raised by his Uncle. I'm intrigued to see where it goes,2023-06-15
"Amazing movie from the compassionate parenting themes, token minority themes, capitalism/anarchy, forging your own path, and not letting society tell you where you belong and what you can do. 

They broke so many superhero and story writing “rules” and it all lead up to Miles breaking canon plot which was meta genius. 

The writers introduced new types of morals and messages perfectly wrapped up in a funny, emotional and action packed ride. 

Can’t wait for part 2!",2023-06-21
"Just saw the film, and it exceeded my expectations by a country mile. What a masterpiece. Best film of the year for me.

Why Miles' parents want to ground him? He gets great grades, isn't in trouble with the cops, or does drugs. He's a teenager. Of course he's late and shifty.

"I had a great time. The animation blew me away, just like last time. And even though it isn’t as complete of a movie as the first one, I just know that when Beyond the Spider-verse comes out, it will complete one of the best superhero trilogies of all time",2023-06-02
"Looking back it was so obvious that Miles was going to go to Earth-42 instead of his Earth… the machine even explicitly said it

Yet I missed every single hint, both obvious and subtle, and the reveal took me by complete surprise

And I’m glad I did, made for a hell of an experience

Side Note: Peter Parkedcar was my biggest laugh in a movie theater in years. Do we think he is the Spider-Man from the “Cars” universe?",2023-06-02
One thing I noticed but am unsure of is that Gwen has her captain dying canon event with her dad because he “dies” in a sense when he quits the force. Maybe I’m over analyzing,2023-06-02

"Watched it yesterday as it was released a day earlier  in India. 


This movie blows the 1st one out of the park. In animation, story, character development, humor and emotional weight be it any department, it has surpassed its predecessor.


The ending was kind of unexpected but now I'm actually eager for the future projects.",2023-06-02
Spiderverse is what film is about. Easily one of the best movies of all time in my opinion. It goes beyond animation. This is ART.,2023-06-02
"I didn’t think Daniel Pemberton could top his ‘Into’ score but I think he might have. Gwen’s theme is absolutely incredible, unique, perfectly suited to the character and equally as good as Miles’s. Miguel’s theme is so looming and ominous and comes in like a barreling freight train. And oh my God the title score, even though it’s shorter than the first, just put a massive smile on my face in the theatre. Honestly, just listening to it hammers home the darker tone of this one compared to the first one. I only wish the mix in my theatre was better to appreciate it more, but a repeat viewing perhaps in IMAX might do the trick.",2023-06-02

"Accidentally wrote this in the review thread because I thought it was the same thing lol so I’m posting here too:

When the “To be continued” popped up I legitimately thought it was a fake out, not in a bad way but because I was enjoying the movie so much I couldn’t believe it had already been over 2 hours.

As somebody who went to see the first one in theaters 5+ times I was blown away with how good the sequel was. This had all the vibes of an animated Spidey cartoon I grew up watching with the story and visual effects on a whole other level. Seeing all the different animation styles in Dolby was a goddamn experience.",2023-06-02

"every so often I’m pretty sure I had a tear rolling down my cheek just from the sheer beauty of this film. The animation, the voice-acting (Oscar Isaac was incredible), the soundtrack, the narrative, the expanding universe and the characters - as close to perfect as that sequel could get. Deserves to break tradition and get a place in the best film category at the Oscars.

Also, I think a lot of people are disappointed with the way it ended because they didn’t know it was a part one. In the early stages, it was marketed as ‘part one’ but it seems like they took that away and decided to call part two ‘beyond the spider-verse’.",2023-06-02

Hello Peter Parkedcar  


The conflict was so good, I was rooting for all sides (even The Spot)

"When I was was in high school my mom and I would go to Barnes and Noble and I’d always read comics and graphic novels while she browsed. This movie recaptured that for me. Crazy premise, tons of cool characters and beats, compelling cliffhanger. I loved how it had editor notes like some comics too. Spider-Verse 1 and 2 feel like perfect comic book movies to me. Was so hyped to see Noir at the end! I’ll probably have to catch this again before it leaves theaters.",2023-06-02
They should cast Sofia Coppola in the sequel and have a family reunion with Cage and Schwartzman.,2023-06-02
The cliffhanger plot twist in this one is truly a rival to Infinity War. I started noticing the eeriness when Miles’ mom moved out of the door frame and you can clearly see the water color background.,2023-06-02
Just saw it and thought it was amazing. I really can't wait until I get the 4K BD and can watch it again.,2023-06-02
"Fastest 2 and a half hours of my life. I swear, until I heard the soundtrack building up to the cliffhanger at the end I didn't notice how long the movie had been going. 

I get that the cliffhanger could have felt too abrupt for some folks. The other well regarded setup movies (Two Towers, Empire, Infinity War) all had obvious climax points and a stable ending that set up the sequel. Spiderverse is a ""Comic Book"" movie though and leans into its source material a lot. The ""to be continued"" is like it was pulled straight from the pages. It worked for me even though I forgot it was a part 1 going in. 

I couldn't help but laugh though since I had just watched Fast X last week hahah. How many of these are we going to get this year.",2023-06-02
"This might be the most visually appealing movie I've ever seen. It is actually a big artistic step up from Into the Spiderverse.

 It is mind boggling they did this only a $100 million production budget.

"I will fight everyone here when I say this is probably the best Spider-Man film to date. There's so much going for this movie and I don't think I can emphasize how much I loved this movie but I will put down some tiny things I enjoyed.

!Spider-Punk had a small role, but his actions managed to impact the entire movie. A part of me was afraid they were gonna do the whole ""love triangle"" thing with him, Miles, and Gwen, but NOPE. Dude is for real the coolest character in the movie and he walks the walks when it comes to being a full on punk. Hobie for real saw through Miguel's bs and said 'nah' and dipped.!

!Hearing Josh Keaton again as Spectacular Spider-Man was a small thing but I was extremely happy that he made a cameo appearance in the movie and that he was given some attention. I may be too hopeful but maybe this could lead to a comeback? Idk.!

!Spot is such a terrifying villain and I don't need to explain that any further. He for real went from a comical villain to a full blown NIGHTMARE within minutes and Jason Schwartzman did a fantastic job playing him.!

!Do I really need to mention the groundbreaking animation or the ""Amazing"" (pun intended) writing? No I don't.!

!EVERYTHING IS CANON. MCU. VENOM. DONALD GLOVER AS PROWLER. PS4 SPIDER MAN. BRO. I HAVE TO STOP HERE BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY (still) THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE PART OF SPIDER VERSE AND WHY IT WORKS SO WELL.!

!The reveal that Miles was *never* supposed to be Spider-Man threw me out of a loop and I'm shocked that I didn't pick up or thought about that before I saw the movie. Hearing Miguel tear into him about how Miles himself is a walking talking anomaly tug at my heart. But as the first movie proven, *anyone* can wear the mask. Which leads to my final point..!

!Miles Morales as THE PROWLER. I don't need to say much more than that. But I might theorize that this alone proves that Miguel might be wrong about the canon events? That aside, I'M SO HYPED THAT THE OG SPIDER-VERSE GANG IS BACK. Heck I'm even more happy that the sequel is right around the corner. (It's next year but it's still better than waiting five years lol)!

Overall, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I SAW IT YESTERDAY AND LET ME TELL YOU. ***EVERY SINGLE SPIDER MAN FAN WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.**

10/10 See you guys in March 2024!",2023-06-02
"Genuinely a stunning leap for animated movies. It was serious but hilarious at the same time, beautifully animated and using the multiverse as a tool to experiment with different unique art styles, which was genius. Just a wonderful, beautiful, amazing movie. Gwen’s universe in particular with watercolor designs that would change according to her mood was a particular touch I loved, and the editor’s notes and split screens scattered throughout the movie really called back to the comic book vibe. Just a brilliant movie that I hope will serve as an example for what animation can do as a medium, and it shows why saying “it’s just a kid’s movie” shouldn’t be an excuse anymore.",2023-06-02

Spider-Man 2099 is an S tier villain, second in the Spider-Man movies to Dafoe's Goblin.

The movie was fantastic.  Will have to see it again if I would put it above the first Spider-Verse or No Way Home.",2023-06-02
"I am OK with ending a movie on a cliffhanger; however, I think in a movie, you should have a clear beginning and end to most of the plot, as opposed to a TV series where multiple storylines are left hanging. I feel it would have felt more like a finished chapter if the perspective was completely Gwen's.",2023-06-02
"Damn ya’ll weren’t kidding about that ending being abrupt. But all and all a solid 10/10 from me. Honestly it’s everything a movie sequel should strive to be.

Now I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again. If Beyond the Spider-verse manages to stick to the landing(and honestly at this rate I would be shocked if it didn’t), then we honestly are looking at the greatest trilogy in not just animation, but in cinema as a whole.

So please for the love of god, be a stellar follow up Beyond the Spider Verse and go out on a high note.

"Thanks Lego Spider-Man, you're one of our best.",2023-06-03
"What an amazing movie. From the opening scenes with Gwen the animation is on a tier by itself. When she walks into her place and she is literally a shade of blue, and then the colors are almost water color shifting with the tone of the conversation. 

And then to have a total 180 on multiple antagonists. The spot starts as a random goofball who you don’t take serious, to quite literally one of the scariest villains I’ve seen in a movie in a while. Just absolute terror and malice. And the artwork when he goes completely black was just sinister. And then hobie being a person you want to hate because implications between Gwen and him and weird love triangle energy, but he ends up being just a fantastic character who you can’t help but love. 

The movie is also extremely funny, especially in the mumbattan section. But also the very real parents conversations that were spliced into the movie perfectly. 

But my favorite bits were just Miles being resilient especially on the train section, even feelings betrayed by all his friends. Just chefs kiss. Absolutely awesome movie. Probably going to see it again.",2023-06-03
"Feel like this movie is what Dr strange wanted to be but 100x better ..

Killer sound track VA animation.

While the ""to be continued"" ending is a bit annoying, the turn around time is less than a year and from a plot perspective, it's in a great position. 

Only issue was the sound mix. I could barely hear Gwen at parts as well as spiderpunk.

Those disappointed in ""no climax"" truly just want to watch another run of the mill MCU movie. The movie spends so much more time than your avg MCU movie on character drama and Imo it all lands. I hope more super hero movies go towards a character focus more than shitty CGI.  MCU likes to do the opposite these days but hopefully they learn.",2023-06-03

"I did not watch any trailers apart from short ads on twitch and youtube so I did not know that The Spot was gonna be a major villain here. His introduction in this movie was also really silly so I assumed he was gonna be this side villain here. 

Holy hell I had goosebumps when he became an actual threat in the middle of the movie. He already has the perfect presentation as a villain. His powers and theme are amazing. I hope the sequel will have more of him and maybe learn more about his motivations.

Also didn't expect the amount of live action here. Yeah it was only a couple, but still more than I expected.",2023-06-03
"In this movie, Spider-man 2099 tells Miles that if it weren’t for him, the Spider-man of his universe would not have died. He says it was his fault his Spider-man died.

So I went back and watched the first movie again but I don’t see how that statement is true? I don’t think Miles’ involvement made any difference to Spider-man’s death at all. Spider-man only stopped to save him when there was a lull in the fighting. Then, Green Goblin held Spider-man’s head into the beam shooting out of Kingpin’s machine, which then exploded and injured Spider-man. Kingpin then goes to the injured Spider-man and kills him.

I don’t see how Miles in any way caused Spider-man’s death. At the very least if that statement was not a lie, then the first movie did not do a good job showing it.",2023-06-03

Seeing Peter B as a father was a wholesome and warming experience (I hope those Marvel editors take note instead ruining the character in the comics), Gwen universe was greatly adapted, same vibes as the comic one, Spot was funny until he got fucking real with the power up, visuals were outstanding as usual and O'Hara, man, he was scary af, even more feral than comics and I loved it

"Man I was a little worried this wouldn't live up to the original, but I think it matched it easily. Though the ending is gonna be a sore spot, I am at least *immensly hyped*.

I don't need to talk more about the visuals, those speak for themselves. The film is gorgeous, so many shots where I think ""that'd be an amazing wallpaper background"". Lots of different styles too. I love that they drew Spider-people from across mediums, even if it leant mostly on animated/drawn styles.

I think the thematic throughfare was great, but also needs the second part to wrap it up nicely.

If the first film was about Miles getting to grips with what he wants to be, then I guess this one is about him proving he *can* be that person. His mom talking about how her little boy has grown into a man, contrasted by how characters call him ""boy"" or ""kid"" and how he doesn't like that.

There's the whole thing with how Miguel calls him out for how he's not *supposed* to be Spider-Man. Which is like what his parents were saying about if he left Brooklyn, he has to assert himself that he does belong. It really is a film about branching out I suppose as well.

The Spot even fits into this; everyone treats him as a joke at first, but his motive is to literally prove himself as a threat, and make Miles pay for what he did to him (and of course, the irony that Miles only did that because of what he did to Miles, it's all circular)

And I think it'll come through in the next part, but fighting fate. The Prowler Miles at the end was such a sick reveal, when it said Miles teleported to Universe 42, I thought there was going to be a bit where he's in the wrong universe, but when Uncle Arren appeared; oh man. That's such a sick reveal - again its why it hurts so much that we've gotta wait for the next part!

ALSO! I WAS *DREAMING* OF A SCENE WHERE ALL THE PREVIOUS SPIDER-PEOPLE COME BACK FOR AN EPIC RESCUE OR CAVALRY CHARGE, and we're going to get it. Oh my god. I'm so happy! I just hope that Miles saves his dad in the next one, it'd be sad to lose him. I wonder if Prowler Miles is going to be a recurring force in the next one, or just a one-and-done.

Also wondering if it'll get *really* meta. I kinda hope not honestly, meta is fun in small doses. Also, why is Miguel a vampire? Is he a vampire? I didn't really get that...",2023-06-04

"Really fantastic movie. Will be going to see this one again. Saw it on a huge screen and glad I did! My favourite things;

1. The animation... DUH! It's beautiful but the variation is jawdropping. This is what good art direction is, instead of pumping out CGI crap every 3 months with zero identity. That every character has a clear identity through how they're animated contineus to be wonderful.

2. The soundtrack was fantastic. I'm really hoping that alone gets an oscar because it was soooo brilliant and did a great job of accentuating all the emotional beats. The music and animation in the scene where Miles speaks to his Dad, with the flowing plastic roof? WOW! That was worth the admission alone.

3. I had it in the back of my head that this was a two-parter because Beyond The Spider-Verse has been known about. Still, wasn't 100% sure it was gonna be a cliffhanger ending What they managed to do really well, though, was tie a nice bow around Gwen's emotional arc with her dad as it starts and ends the film. I think narratively they made all the right choices to guide us to knowing this first part was *her* story about Miles, and that the next film will be Miles'. I was also impressed with how the ending sort of kept approaching. After Gwen has the bit with her dad, it feels like the film is gonna end after every other shot... but they keep ratcheting the tension up! It's a great way to keep us wanting more because enough new storylines are established for a second part to be justified.

All in all this is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen and once Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out I'm sure this trilogy will be *THE* best superhero film series ever.",2023-06-04

"What an increidlbe film.  I'll need a rewatch, but i think this might be the best looking animated film i've ever seen.  It's just beautiful.

&#x200B;

Huge fan of the movie taking it's time to tell it's story.  There's a good 30 minutes of just characters interacting with each other before we even get to the spiderverse, and even when we are there... they do more character development.   I was very into it.

&#x200B;

The ""to be continued"" doesn't bother me that much because if it's on the same ""quality"" as this film.. i might say its the best animated trilogy to date.  It's that good!

&#x200B;

My biggest issue is the sound mixing, like a lot of people have mentioned here.  Not sure if it was intentional, or just... bad?  But there were a few scenes where.. i just couldn't understand a damn thing because i couldn't hear them over the music.  The beginning, every scene with punk spider-man (a shame too), gwen and miles swinging through the city, and i think 2 or 3 scenes with ""the spot"" were just very hard to understand what was being said.",2023-06-05
"Just got back from seeing this. Some (spoilery) thoughts: 
  
1. I see at least one movie a week at my local theater. Most times, I either have the whole theater to myself or share it with maybe a handful of others. Tonight, the showing I went to was sold out, so I had to go to a later one, and even that was packed. 
2. I had only just seen the first one earlier today ahead of plans to go see this. I enjoyed the first but this was even better. Sort of like *Portal* vs *Portal 2*: this felt far more fleshed out of the concept established in the first one.
2. >!The whole theater collectively groaned when ""To Be Continued"" showed up on the screen. I think that's actually a testament to how good the movie was; I certainly wanted it to keep going and didn't feel it had overstayed its welcome.!< 
3. >!Miguel was right, and Miles was being emotionally-reactionary and selfish. I get that kind of response, and I bet that others had it as well (including Gwen) when told of their role in the fabric of time and such, and what the sacrifice meant, but they all seemed to accept and make peace with it, rather than risk the entirety of the multiverse for one person (a line repeated more than once in the movie). I'm sure of course that Miles will end up saving both, as he said, but it's a big risk and it makes sense for the entire Spider-verse to go after him to save their own individual original worlds as opposed to help him. That part (especially the end with Gwen's group) seems hard for me to grasp.!<",2023-06-05
"This is a follow up to a previous comment analyzing the characters questions and moral questions of the film a bit. There are a couple more incredible story and visual details I wanted to bring up and encourage some discussion on (I've seen the film four times now, I have a problem).

Pavitr:

The film makes sure to note how new Pavitr is to being Spider-Man. He's only six months in and he claims that being Spider-Man is ""sooooo easy!"" (something we know is absolutely not true). He's given his (implied) first ""playbook"" Spider-Man challenge when saving civilians from the collapsing Alchemax building. While holding onto a bus filled with people, including his love interest, he sees that Inspector Singh is in mortal danger and tells himself that he ""can do both"", he can save everyone. This directly mirrors Miles's current situation as well as Miles's current attitude. However, Pavitr isn't the main protagonist of the story, we can see that he can't do both (while reassuring himself he can ""do both"" he begins to wrap the single thread of web suspending the bus full of people onto one of the small concrete grid rods sticking out of the collapsed bridge he's hanging onto), he can't save everyone, Miles had to intervene for everyone to be saved. Miles's intervention is mirrored by Gwen and her band's intervention in helping Miles in the next film. However, Pavitr's dimension collapsing could foreshadow that the band's help won't actually address and resolve the moral problem presented. To note, Pavitr was spared the pain of losing Inspector Singh, but he was also denied this opportunity to grow, he wasn't challenged to forge ahead in the face of the death of someone close to him.

George Stacy:

Aside all the current analysis on George Stacy's role in proving that canon can be subverted as well as Gwen's ""coming out"" character arc to her father, there's a parallel between George and Miles that I don't see anyone talking about. One of the core themes of Across the Spider-Verse is responsibilities, specifically conflicting responsibilities (the moral dilemma). George Stacy does not only possess responsibility as a father, but he possesses responsibility as a cop. When Gwen is revealed to be Spider-Woman to him, his two responsibilities are immediately made incompatible with one another. He's forced into a position to choose one responsibility over another, he chooses to be a father over being a cop. This further plays into another theme in the film, ""you can't have it all"". In George Stacy's little monologue, ""police captain"" is interchangeable with ""Spider-Man"", the mask is the badge and vice versa. Miles is in a position now where, with the information given to him and us the audience, his responsibility as Spider-Man is in conflict with his responsibility as a son. He may ultimately have to make a choice to uphold one responsibility and abandon the other. We want Gwen Stacy to come out on top, so having George quit the responsibility of police captain is great for her and for us, but having Miles quite the responsibility of being Spider-Man is a much more morally challenging choice.

Clearing up Jeff Davis's role in Prowler Miles / Miles-42's life:

I've been seeing some debate online on whether Miles-42's dad had been absent from his upbringing or whether he had died recently (similarly to the timeline of Uncle Aaron's death). When the ""camera"" follows Miles-1610 around his Earth-42 home variant, the family photos only contain him and his mom. When the camera follows Gwen around Miles's Earth-1610 home variant, the family photos contain all three members of the Davis/Morales family. Both characters are used as tour guides to subtly inform the audience that Jeff has been dead for most of Miles-42's life and wasn't a large part of his upbringing (not a recent death).

Peter B. Parker:

I absolutely love Peter's monologue to Miles about ""good"" things and ""bad"" things happening. His message to Miles is a much more emotionally touching and charitable version of the current status quo of what it means to be Spider-Man. The message highlights that there will always be bad things that happen, you can't always stop them from happening, you probably often can't stop them from happening, but you have to take the good with the bad, you have to find a reason to keep going (rest in power Uncle Aaron), you have to make a reason to keep going. Struggling and fighting more and more against the bad actively prevents you from finding that good and those reasons, trying to shut down the all the harm and all the pain now furiously and stubbornly creates more harm by shutting down the good you could've fostered in healing and moving on (a much better version of Miguel's point). Peter is a more optimistic and emotionally charitable version of Miguel in reiterating this point and approach on Spider-Man as a character, and this compassion encouraged Miles to begin processing this point of view. However, the watch's beeper prevented us from getting to see Miles begin to seriously consider this approach.

Miles's Strength:

Miles speech to his Earth-42 variant of his mom was incredible. The line ""I know how strong I am now"" has beat me with an emotional stick during each of my four viewings. To go through exactly what his mom foreshadowed he would go through and to come out with an experience that validates his identity and his claim to the Spider-Man mantle of power is the kind of self-discovery that inspires us to be strong, assertive, independent, and charitable to ourselves. But here's the thing, Miles's strength hasn't faced the ultimate test yet. He hasn't yet come face to face with the death of his dad and the destruction of his universe. His immediate and current moral decision is to still risk the safety of everything else and everyone else to rescue his father (see Pavitr). He thinks he can save everyone, he thinks he can have it all, he doesn't actually know how strong he is yet.

Miles being a ""unique"" Spider-Man:

I've seen a lot of sentiment that because Mile's is a ""unique"" Spider-Man, he is, or should be, exempt from the ""rules"" of canon.  Miles isn't actually all that unique though.  He's ""unique"" in the sense that he's the main character, so we're meant to empathize with him and focus on the differences between his journey as Spider-Man from the journeys of other Spider-People.  However, showing us an absolutely TON of Spider-People in Spider-Society isn't just fanservice.  We get so many different costumes, color schemes, body-types, voices/accents, and artstyles between the Spider-People that it's difficult to find any two that look nearly identical in any scene where we see the Spider-Society.  Each Spider-Person is ""unique"" the same way Miles is, they each have their own stories and their own aesthetic.  I think the writers' deliberately chose to highlight how unique each Spider-Person is as well as highlight how they are all still the same because of the common narrative threads between all their stories.  Despite how unique any of the Spider-People are, their experiences have broadly given them the same moral lessons.",2023-06-05
"The opening action scene gave me feelings that took me back to early MCU days.  It was just so satisfying.  The music and action struck the nerve just perfectly in a way I haven't felt in theaters in a long time.  I didn't feel like I was watching a rehash of something I'd seen over and over again. And while the movie itself was great, the soundtrack really took it to another level. 

It was just fun all the way through. And it took itself seriously even with all the meta humor.  And every character was well fleshed out and brought something positive.  There were no wasted scenes.  And it perfectly balanced being family friendly while primarily targeting adults.

Best time I've had in a theatre in a long time",2023-06-05
"Idk if I'm just a complete idiot but I've had something on my mind since I walked out of the theatre a few days ago.

So Miguel explains that every Spider Man has a canon event where they all experience a great tragedy, and this includes Miles. But later says Miles is an anomaly and he was never supposed to be Spider Man.

So do the canon events create themselves any time someone is bitten by the spider? Or does Miles have a canon event because the spider that bit him was destined to bite *someone* and it just got the wrong person? Because I feel like Miles shouldn't have a canon event because him becoming Spider Man wasn't supposed to be canon according to Miguel.

Am I just being an idiot? Did I miss something? Is there a comic explanation that I'm not understanding?",2023-06-05
"I loved it, but not as much as the first one or Spider-Man 2. It's really hard to judge the story, though, as it's only half done. Thank god Beyond is coming in March.

* The animation is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. They found the absolutely perfect balance of all the competing styles and mediums so that it never felt messy. If ITSV was a game changer for Western animation, then ATSV throws the game out the window and builds three completely new ones to replace it.

* The action scenes and swinging scenes, too, are a huge improvement over the first.

* The ending felt very Back to the Future-esque. Miles trapped in the wrong universe, Hobie leaving a watch for Gwen, even the ""TBC"" tag.

* I like how the Spider-Verse includes not only its own multiverse, but the MCU films, Sony films, comics, video games, merch and animated series as well. It feels like a very EEAO take on this concept.

* Speaking of which, weird that there's two multiverse movies that hinge on a bagel.

* I have mixed feelings on the Spider Society. I find it really hard to buy into the idea that every Spider-Man in the multiverse except Miles would accept this predestination shtick. Especially when the last Spider-Man movie was about a Spider-Man trying to change the fates of dead villains. It's also weird that this seems to be the only Miles on the team, when there's so many Mileses in the multiverse. Heck, Insomniac Spider-Man shows up and he has a Miles as a protégé. 

* Since the release of the first game, Insomniac Spider-Man has met the comics Spider-Man in a comic book multiverse adventure and met the animated Spider-Mans in a cinematic multiverse adventure. Do you think they will address this at all, in any way in Spider-Man 2?

* The sound mixing was really bad. Gwen's narration and Hobie's dialogue were unintelligible at times.",2023-06-05
"I absolutely loved this movie, and I'll be seeing it again really soon. Gwen's universe was spectacular, and her story was perfectly written.

That said, and I'm sure this was intentional, but I was constantly frustrated with how she treated Miles throughout the movie. I kept waiting for her to stick up for Miles and be a good friend. Be the ONLY one that's there for him, but I'll have to wait for the third movie for that, and honestly, I don't know if she deserves Miles. She'll save him, and he'll forgive her, assuming she doesn't sacrifice herself. Her dynamic with Miles was tropey in this movie, and that disappointed me. Otherwise, I loved it!",2023-06-05

Too many people talking at the same time, loud music and shit flying everywhere, not to mention the amazing use of color in the film. I’ve never had an experience like that watching a movie. Once we got to Spider-Verse HQ, I got better and I throughly enjoyed it. I know I’m not even close to the majority. I feel bad because I recognize just how amazing this movie is. This is a movie I think everyone should go see. But at the same time, I don’t know how to feel about it because of my experience.",2023-06-06

"No point in picking sides. Miguel's goal was the same yet diff. to Kingping. Trying to change history by intentionally taking or placing its multiverse counterpart. But he fails to notice that Miles, being the anomaly has a lot unknowns and possibilities. Miles is the byproduct of an event which already rewrited history. If the canon Algorithm stated Miles should'nt exist, it already contradicted itself with Miles's earth working fine. Miles can't save Uncle Aaron, but he can save his dad as history is up for grabs.

TLDR: The canon Algorithm is flawed and Miles has the choice of saving his dad without the collaspe of the multiverse. He only needs to save his dad since the multiverse is already adapting to this new Miles.",2023-06-07
"Ok so I love how this whole theme of destiny affects both characters. Miles and the spot. Both of those characters feel like they don't have a choice but to be whatever society defines them to be.

I get that he's different and all but there's literally no way anyone could escape that many spiderpeople at once with zero help. They're all as skilled or much more than he is, it just doesn't make sense to me.   
That scene bothered a lot. Other than that, amazing movie.",2023-06-07
"I feel like this runs into some of the same problems that Loki ran into, where they're saying they have to protect the universes from multiverse interference, but a lot of those events that they're trying to protect are the direct result of multiverse interference.

Like they were saying that the Mumbattan canon event was the bridge falling on the Captain, but the only reason that bridge even fell was because someone from a different universe made it fall. So without multiversal interference then the Captain wouldn't have died anyways.",2023-06-07

"One thing that I find interesting about this world building is that Earth-42 directly contradicts Miguel's assertion that these events must happen or the universe will end. Or, like, with Spot creating another hole in the multiverse. Miguel insists it's because Miles messed with that universe's canon, but it's obvious that that hole there is specifically because Spot blew a hole in the multiverse. What happened to Miguel is, I think, what was described in Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness, and considering how many elements were used from the MCU here, I don't think that's a coincidence. Miguel doesn't realize it, but his presence in that universe specifically caused an Incursion. But he won't accept it. I think the next film is going to be about Miles closing out his arc, of course, but also Miguel coming to understand that his actions have not always been right and condemning an infinite number of Spider people to tragic backstories makes him a monster.",2023-06-09
"I thought the movie was really, really good, but the only issue I had was how...easily it seemed Miles got away from all the Spider-Men.

"Saw it yesterday finally. Blown away. It was as good or better than the first. This movie was ART. Gwen opening/closing the film and her decisions having such impact on the plot made it equally her story which was great setup / investment for the third movie (and a joy to watch).    
  
The only constructive criticism I have is they could have finished Miles' story up in the conversation with his mother where he realizes he's in the wrong dimension (still have Gwen assemble the band at the end and give some plausible '42 is dangerous, it doesn't have a Spiderman'). They could have saved 42-Miles and 42-Aaron for some Act 1 suspense and thrill in Beyond and tightened the story a bit.

E.g.s:

\- 1967 Spider-Man conveniently pulling something right when he's coming at Miles

\- Cyborg Spider-Woman 'accidentally' blasting Ben Reilly, interrupting his sleeper hold on Miles. And later blowing open a vent that Miles was falling through.

Of course, it's also entirely possible that the Spiders just don't work well together, considering that they usually operate individually. That could then result in them unintentionally hindering each other.",2023-07-01

"So, just been thinking about this for a while, but if Blonde Peter destroyed the collider like Miguel claims he was supposed to, wouldn't Gwen be stuck in 1610 and inevitably die? Remember she was already in-universe before Miles got bitten...
Also, I don't understand how her explanation of ""her spider senses told her to go to Miles' school"" holds up, being that Miles wasn't bitten yet, and per Miguel wasn't even supposed to get bitten.
Something just doesn't add up, and it bugs me because they seem to have been pretty meticulous about putting the plot together in this movie and I think it's a pretty significant hole if it's not addressed.",2023-08-27

"After considering the movie for a bit and looking at different opinions, I think I’ve come to recognize my own. That said, it might get refined with another viewing.

Overall 8/10, I liked the first one better as it was a whole story.

Pros:

•	⁠Animation was beautiful
•	⁠Acting was great
•	⁠Plot and drama were gripping (personally, I know some people thought it was slow/boring)
•	⁠Hobie best boy
•	⁠Action scenes were very fun

Cons:

•	⁠Ended very abruptly. I would have preferred even ending at the point where Miles realizes he was sent to the wrong dimension, maybe add the Gwen spider team.
•	⁠They rehashed the lizard Peter thing twice (once in the first movie recap, and a fuller backstory for Gwen). I think they could have kiboshed the first movie recap at the start.
•	⁠Audio mixing at the start (Gwen’s monologue) was wonky

Hot take(s): All the comic nerds predicting that Miguel isn’t a real Spider-Man, has a made up backstory, and will be a secret vampire villain are dumb.

We saw that our Peter was with him when his universe got messed up, and making his whole trolley problem schtick just an act would undermine all the themes they worked to build up in this movie. Would they say Miles isn’t a real Spider-Man because he has slightly different powers, so he has to be a different character altogether?

If I turn out to be wrong then so be it.

Also:

•	⁠Yes, the spider people realizing that sacrifices may need to happen is ok and within character. See the first movie, where everyone tells Miles that they all lost someone but that made them who they are. “The hardest part of this job is that you can’t always save everyone”",2023-06-02
yall gave it 9 or 10 huh movie an 8,2023-06-02
"I was so happy that my theater got a new sound system or... maybe they just turned it up. The mix was terrible, I had so many moments where I just couldn't understand wtf was being said. Like Tenet bad. There is that one sequence right before the titles I swear sounds like Gwen is having a stroke or I was in the theater.

The movie is visually unrivaled, it's beautiful, but it's all mostly forgetable outside of that. But maybe the first one was to in many ways? I don't remember Miles getting invisibility, but I do remember lots of bits of plot and the general vibe. Here, it's all over the place and mostly fan service.

The villian in this is fun and interesting. But, the way they set him up and then just completely ignore him for the rest of the movie is just not a good look. Miles having a friend who knows his identity, but is not really a friend is weird when his whole schtick is that he can't tell people his identity and has no friends... His obessesion with Gwen and her obsession back is weird and creepy. It's not played up as love. It's like an endless hover hand over the shoulder. The parents don't seem like characters anymore, they feel like they're there to just move Miles from scene to scene. The whole fact that all Spider folks basically know and have access to all of time is kind of world breaking and makes the whole plot feel dumb. The ultimately... ending where it did was incredibly anti-climatic.

Reviews for this are way too generous.",2023-06-04

Terrible ending point.

Title should reflect it’s a Part 1.

I’m very conflicted because it genuinely ruined the experience for me, but I know when the next is out it’ll probably be amazing combined. 

Ultimately I can’t support this decision, it feels like a greed move to not end with any conclusion, no bonus scene and not indicator to the viewer that what they’re in for is half a product. 

My entire theatre was having an audible blast, and when those credits hit it was an noticeable mood kill and everyone left annoyed or pissed. Clearly they did testing and knew they’d get this reaction.",2023-06-11

"I'm kinda surprised to see such high numbers in the poll so far. I was pretty let down by this movie. Now I'll admit I hadn't seen the first one until just last night so it was still super fresh in my mind, but I don't think this one held a candle to that one at all. It was very slow, and I wasn't at all surprised to see the ""To be continued..."" at the end, because it felt like the entire movie was just prelude and build-up that never paid off. The pacing was very weird with lots of slow, dramatic scenes, a few tense scenes mixed in, and then no real payoff. And a lot of the dramatic scenes started to feel repetitive. They had very clearly made the point about the conflict between being Spider-Man and hiding it from your family by the halfway point, but then they kept hammering it over and over again.

I'm assuming the climax was supposed to be the giant Spider-Man chase, but I didn't even realize it at the time because I kept expecting it to actually go somewhere with the main villain afterwards. Instead we had to be reminded that he even exists at the end of the movie because he just vanished for two days. And the movie was only two hours long but it felt way longer. I had to keep resisting the urge to check the time and see how long I'd been sitting there. Not to say I was bored, but I wasn't edge of my seat either. And my friends' kids that came with us were definitely getting fidgety long before that point. The older one said she was kinda confused by the end too, and I can definitely see how the plot would be a bit confusing for kids.",2023-06-03

"The first one was a 10/10 for me. Truly so inventive both visually and storytelling wise.

Second one is a 8/10.

Overall story wise I didn’t find it as fresh as the first. I didn’t find the villains to be as menacing or interesting as the prowler or kingpin in the first one. The Spot felt like comedic relief and Miguel felt like a character that feels too familiar. Spot felt like he was quickly forgotten midway and then the movie focuses on Miguel, The spiderverse Canon, doppelgänger multiverse shinangans and by the time it comes back to Spot arriving in Mile’s universe - everything left for Part 2 feels like a forgone conclusion (impending big Marvel battle/war) that I don’t necessarily feel invested in.

I didn’t like the live action fan service. It just felt inelegant and unnecessary for some reason.

The standout overall for me was Gwen’s universe both visually and story wise.

On an unrelated note - Did anyone else find the coming out scenes very queer coded?",2023-06-03
"Man, I think I'm multiverse'd out. This movie feels like a Rick and Morty episode, council of ~~Mortys~~ Spider-Men included. How many multiverse stories have we gotten in the past few years? There's  been Loki, Into the Spiderverse, Dr Stange 2, No Way Home, EEAAO.  It almost seems trite at this point.

I think there was a point in the movie where they even reference this. Someone says something like ""The fate of the multiverse is at stake."" and someone else retorts something like ""I don't even know what that means anymore.""

Moreover, I think its constant meta references uncut a lot of the sincere emotional core of the movie. It may have well as Lego Spider-Man for how much it delights in referencing other properties.

I still loved the movie, but I think it goes from a 10/10 to a 9/10 for me, just because I'm burnt out on multiverses.",2023-06-03
"Very hard on the eyes, and the dialogue was sometimes hard to hear. The ending sucked.

Good movie tho, fun references, fun cameos.

7.5",2023-06-05
"Good movie, but really hard to get me emotionally invested in it, same problems with the first one. I guess they're trying to appeal to children(?) with the constant jokes straight after an emotional scene, which is kind of kills the vibe of the scene.

Nitpicks:
- a pregnant superhero? Really??
- taking care of a baby WHILE fighting?? 
- using said baby to make someone less angry in a conversation?? 
-overweight spiderman?? Really?? How can they do backflips and web around when they're starring on my 600lb life??  
- Peter Parker saying random ass stuff to say that he was ""inspired"" by miles to have a kid. Really?? May be I need to watch the first movie again because I don't haven't the slightest recollection of that ever being happening/or being implied. 
- the whole ""spider-society"" tf. One scene they show some spiderman holding guns and marching like they're soldiers..? What, aren't yall litteraly spiderman? Why are you guys marching?? 
- villains lack depth (unsurprisingly, it's a superhero movie)... Are not interesting. Hopefully spiderman 2099 gets more development in the future movie. 
- weird dialogue at times, when spiderman 2099 is chasing miles on the train and out of nowhere miles starts his monologue ""... My name is miles morales. I was a bitten by a radioactive spider...""  blah blah blah. Why, why are you saying these words miles. I litteraly started laughing at loud at the absurdity of it all. 
- unnecessary tension build up for scenes, that when you look back on, eas completely unnecessary. When miles is seeing gwen go to the Indian spiderman dimension, wtf was the point of miles being invisible and taking a moment to decide. 
-characters don't make sense. Or evil miles morales knocking out good miles morales dor some reason? Or the uncle punching him for some reason? Character decisions don't make sense. 
-the fucking cameos, oh my soul the cameos. I DONT CARE IF IT'S DONALD GLOVER OF TOBY MAGUIRE PLEASE LET'S GET BACK TO THE MOVIE. But other people adore it so eh.
- goofy at times which kills the immersion. Kung fu panda 2 had tbe perfect amount of gofyness but still made me ball my eyes out.
- scenes are weirdly built up. Miles's uncle starts playing music for some reason. I feel like a lot of emphasis is placed on ""aesthetic if the scene"" instead of a scene naturally flowing out between the characters... Again, killing my immersion.
- building fake tension in a scene when there is no tension.
- story is a mess at times, which is probably because of the above mentioned factors.
- also spiderman 2099 said that stopping a cannon event breaks the universe. Which we were shown to be a true statement. Now, miles has zero idea how to stop his father dying, and even if he does, it's going to kill everyone in his universe. He has zero plans on how to stop that too. So his rebellion against spiderman 2099 makes zero sense. I really hoped they don't put in some bullshit plot device that let's miles save his dad and his universe. 


Other than that, Gwen's story was nice, but loved her scenes with miles even more. Miles scenes with his family were also ten out of ten. These two were the highlight of the movie. Animation was great too, so was the music.",2023-06-05
"I'm ready for the down votes, but unfortunately I found Across The Spider-Verse underwhelming. Its not at all a bad movie, but it was no where near the expected greatness I heard about. I'll just quickly brush over my thoughts:

The pacing was off. I totally get the character building they were trying to do, but I found that the film stayed uncomfortably long on scenes that didnt seem to move the plot forward. Miles and his parents clearly are having issues, but instead of his parents taking any real action toward figuring why their son is always disappearing, they take it fairly easy on him and ultimately give him a pass to do whatever he wants. In reality, concerned parents would of worried their son is either on drugs, or messing with a girl or a bad crowd of people. And after seeing Miles with Gwen, would of immediately suspected she's the reason for his weird behavior and taken appropriate action. 

The Spot was... interesting. I definitely like how they made him a bigger threat than he was jn the comics. But, his motivations were a bit flimsy to me. I get his anger toward Miles, but with how angry he was with Miles you'd think Miles did everything to him on purpose. In reality Miles did what he had to in order to save the universe, and the spot was an unfortunate casualty of that. Despite this, the Spot hates his guts and wants to ruin his entire life. Idk, just doesnt work for me. On top of that, at a certain point he barely pops again and I had nearly forgotten he was even the main villain.

The legion of Spidermen was awesome, and the way the easter eggs worked into the story was satisfying. I totally caught spectacular spiderman, spiderman unlimited, alex ross spiderman, and a few other spidermen I recognize. Spider-Man 2099 was great and had very convincing motivations.

The film was visually exhilarating, but there were times where it felt overwhelming; like when gwen was talking to her dad, the drawing style kept changing and it just seemed unnecessary. 

Overall, a good movie. Not great, not horrible. A worthwhile sequel that is as flawed as it is good. I feel the 1st had a better, more concentrated story.",2023-06-06
"Just came out of watching this movie and i had fun but I’m disappointed and just can’t judge the movie

It’s a fun movie, it’s well animated.  But this isn’t a whole product.

I had read a comment here before watching it that the ending teased a third movie and that at least we wouldn’t have to wait that long for the new one (maybe there is an announcement already?)

But this? I didn’t expect this ending.

This is not a full movie. It cannot be judged. 

The final arc just doesn’t exist. Just when it’s starting it’s completely cut off. As a writer and story teller this really bothers me. I know why they did it but it felt too sudden.

And mostly I guess it comes down to expectations. There are plenty of movies that tease there will be another movie, but they are complete arcs by themselves.

Other movies, for example avengers infinity war, we already know in advance there was going to be another movie, in fact originally they were announced as part 1 and 2 before they were given names.

And even if we didn’t know there was going to be an Avengers End game before hand, the arc of the story is still complete. Thanks set out to do something, progressed through the story and in the end achieves it and completes its arc. We know there will be more of course but the arc isn’t cut short.

Maybe if it was announced and promoted as part one and two. But it wasn’t",2023-06-07
"I think I loved a lot of things about this movie but like... goddamn what a weird place to end it.

Like I knew I was going to be a two-parter but I was not prepared for just ending like halfway through a story arc, like I thought there would be some sort of resolution there idk.

There's just no payoff really. Like Infinity War we Thanos the whole movie as he tries to do one very specific thing and everyone else tries to stop him, and then at the end that thing happens and we just have to sit with it for a year.

This movie like nobody really had a big overarching goal for half of it, and then we meet Miguel and then we get some more stuff about the multiverse but it's... I don't know we just don't get any pay off at the end basically. 

The third movie really better deliver is what I'm saying",2023-06-04
"Okay, so show of upvotes or replies: How many of us *actually* remember when this movie was first marketed as Part One? 

Because I noticed that they dropped the “part one” in the title and just hoped that they pulled an *Infinity War* and NOT a *Justice League* on that…

And I’m noticing a lot of people surprised by the ending.",2023-06-04
"I like how they began the film with Gwen and lead on to Miles.

It's a simple thing but avoiding the whole ""3 months earlier"" flashback sequence gave the movie this flow that could ramp up or down as needed.

All of the characterisation was great, especially Miguel. The trailers had me expecting this angry and authoritative figure but he's clearly sympathetic to Miles' plight (in his own fashion).

Prav was awesome. I'm surprised and a little disappointed that he wasn't present when they were discussing the canon. Don't think he would have agreed with the idea of letting Captain Singh die.

Negatives: the third act was far too long. They could have cut it at numerous points and maintained the energy and emotion the movies was building up to.

Instead, it just felt like a runway train, unable to stop at the designated station.",2023-06-04

Absolutly loved it. Funniest and at the same time one of the most emotional Super Hero Movies. They nailed the family dynamics.

"So I overall enjoyed the film, but there was one moment that really didn’t work for me: I really disagree with the decision to show the send-me-home machine when Miles is using it. 

It VERY clearly (albeit quickly) shows that he’s going to universe 42. The rug-pull/plot-twist moment of revealing that Miles is in the wrong universe is built up to as this big thing, but it’s completely undermined by the fact that the movie has already outright shown, as a fact, that he’s in the wrong one. 

They should’ve avoided this and let the different art (and Miguel’s earlier explanation as to how the machine works) be enough to make the audience sceptical, before revealing Gwen going into the room and not finding Miles/Rio not knowing who Spider-Man is. If you caught that he went to dimension 42, the next several minutes of build-up to the reveal just feels very drawn out and unnecessary.

Maybe a bit of a nit pick. I do like that he ended up in the wrong universe, it’s a good twist. I just feel like they misstepped by first outright revealing that to anyone watching closely, instead of teasing it out, before ultimately having Miles explicitly state it. It’s just kinda like, yeah, I know, I saw what the machine said several minutes ago, the character is just catching up to the audience now and I’m not as invested in his reaction, because I don’t share it.

I also don’t think this movie is as good as the first, though I also consider the first to be one of my favourite films of all time, if not outright #1. I feel like this one just didn’t have the same emotional weight and memorable moments that we had before. 

Plus, Miles’ whole conflict of “I need to go save my dad” doesn’t entirely make sense to me. Miguel and the others talk about every Spider-Man having “their moment” where they lose someone and it changes who they are… but IN THAT SAME CONVERSATION the computer shows Miles losing Uncle Aaron alongside the simulations of everyone else losing someone. It seems to be showing that this was his moment - a sentiment explicitly stated in the first film, mind you - before then stating that he’s going to lose someone else. The movie just kinda seems to re-write its own rules there. EDIT: Someone pointed out that this scene was used to portray that Spider-Man always loses someone close to them AND a police captain, not one or the other. I may have misunderstood this scene if that’s the case.

The central conflict of a Spider-Man having to choose between saving someone they care about and saving everyone is always a good story though. And I really like that he didn’t just accept the situation, but has a knee jerk reaction of “save him now, figure out the rest later”. It’s a lot less noble than so many similar stories where the hero just accepts what needs to be done. And Peter and Gwen needing to re-evaluate their personal choices to side with Miguel after Miles clearly feels betrayed by them is fantastic. All throughout the chase scene, it felt like neither of them knew who’s side they were on.

Spot getting sidelined once Miguel was introduced is understandable but unfortunate. The story pretty much stops paying attention to the main villain (not main antagonist, mind you, that would be Miguel) halfway through the movie, despite him being built up to as this climactic, world destroying villain. The third movie will have a lot to juggle between him, Prowler, and Miguel as antagonists. With a sufficient runtime though, I trust they’ll pull it off.",2023-06-02
"I definitely need to rewatch this the second I get a chance but HOLY shit.

Alright first things first, animation beat the first one out of the park (as expected). The amount of easter eggs and references were so damn delightful to the point where I want to go back and pause each frame to see what I missed. Just to name a few:
-Donald Glover as Prowler referencing Spider-Man Homecoming (literally unbelievable and i'm so happy they did this
-Ganke playing Spider-Man PS4 
-Spectacular Spider-Man makes a short appearance as well but honestly I was just glad I got to see my favoriate childhood spidey for the first time in over 13 years. 
-Live action spidey scenes yadda you get the jist

Anyways I do feel like the pacing of this movie was a bit off? The first hour essentially felt like the first movie which is not a complaint but a bit too slow for something that was marketed as a multiversal rollercoaster (the marketing was awful for this movie as many would agree and I wasn't expecting just a random shitfest but it felt underwhelming), but the actual movie starts around the second half where it finds its emotional depth and shit just gets really fun. I loved Miles' character development and us watching his growth as not only Spider-Man but just as a good hearted kid wanting to do the right thing. The message of wanting a place to belong was really beautiful and the importance of family was showcased in a way where it wasn't cheesy as you'd normally expect from a ""kids movie"". Speaking of that, this movie gets DARK in the second half. The tone slowly gets eerie and I fucking loved it. At some points, I forgot this was a PG movie, the producers did a phenomenal job with the writing. 

Now as for the ending, i'm a bit conflicted with it. On one hand, i'm very happy we are getting another installment of this, the finale of the trilogy BUT it felt like the last 20 minutes were moreso just a teaser/staircase leading upto the next movie. Now I understand it's a two part finale but at the same time, it causes this movie to feel less like a standalone and moreso just a stepping stone, one that'll be forgotten by next year when something bigger and greater comes. As opposed to infinity war, which in it's own right was a great movie with a solid ending because yes it was predictable in endgame where avengers save the day and blah, BUT there was at least a definitive ending to infinity war where Thanos wins instead of being ambigious. 
Overall, apart from the jackshit marketing which gave off argubably the best parts of the movie,weird pacing and ending, it is probably one of the best superhero projects in the last 10 years.",2023-06-02

Undeniably beautiful and ground breaking animation but next to no plot. The film is just 90% spider-men chasing other Spider-Men around and then leaves the audience on a cliffhanger. 

I also hate two-parter movies, films should be self contained stories or you’re just making TV.

We already see him starting to escape with the venom powers and Gwens group is looking for him, Gwen also knows he's in the wrong dimension which Miguels group doesn't 

The prowler twist just seems really low stakes to me, as Miles can easy escape or be broken out.

Also the entire movie builds towards Miles opening up to his parents, and then it just doesn't matter. It feels really unsatisfying",2023-06-02

"Gonna farm some down arrows... but I didn't like it as much as I had hoped.

Like, it either felt 1 hour too long or 1 hour too short to be satisfying. I went in there not knowing it was a 2-parter, but when it got to Miles meeting Miles and Gwen assembling the team I was like *man, this has only just been the 2nd act, the fuck, feels like I've been sat here for 3 hours*... and then it was just over.

The beginning felt like it dragged on for way too long without much happening - I'd like to think that there could've been a better way to show Miles and Gwen living through the same struggles that wasn't just showing the same story basically twice.

Stuff got pretty neat once we got to the spiderverse part, but even there... I think the movie could've done with less Spider-Man running away from Spider-Man and here's the 97th Spider-Man variant - like, not that it was bad, just that it started to drag on eventually.

Spot dude was pretty neat, but kinda just vanished halfway through the movie to make room for Miguel to become the ""villain"" and shout his way through the final hour of the movie.

Also, I kinda think that both the music and the visuals were better in the first one.

Like, I think the movie had a solid 90 minutes worth of a very good story... but repeating the same points over and over and over again while cramming in a solid 137 cameos just didn't do it for me. I'm kinda worried the next movie is gonna be like that as well - a solid 90 minutes worth of plot stretched out to 2+ hours to justify the 2-parter, probably because a single 3h movie just wouldn't work (although I would've most likely prefered that).

Again, not that it was bad... but it didn't hit me like the first one did. Obviously gonna rewatch it 27 times though, so there's that. Also, pretty sad about no prost-credit - even just a slight sneak peak at what's about to come woulda been swell. *Kiiiiinda* felt like they've leaned a bit too hard into *""worked for Infinity War and Endgame, so it's gonna work for us as well""* for me.",2023-06-04

"There's six different conflicts, and we don't get a real one until halfway through the second act. The second and third acts are basically nonstop exposition that doesn't really further the plot, and they just keep going over the same issues again and again. Miles' conflict with The Spot could be resolved with one earnest conversation, Miles' conflict with Gwen keeps getting expanded on in different ways without real resolution or cohesion, and we don't learn about the universe Canon until the movie is halfway over. In the first Spiderverse movie had a central conflict established in the first fifteen minutes. I wish this movie knew what it wanted to be about. 

&#x200B;

The constant changing of animation style was cool at first but then they started doing it so fast that it just became distraction. I liked the visuals of the sequence in Mumbattan because it stuck to one visual style long enough to actually appreciate it, but then the third act had so many different animation styles and color palettes that it just sort of became visual sludge.

"OK so I loved it. I loved every second of it. Art style, soundtrack, writing, everything.

BUT tell me if anyone else had this problem with it: The same as Fast X, I felt like this movie had no 'main event' or climax of its own. Rather, it just felt a bit incomplete and unsatisfying, and a setup for the finale.

At first, I thought maybe this is just how it has to be with two-part movies. But then I remembered how Infinity War/Endgame managed to do it so well, making even the first movie feel like its own, whole thing, even with the most deadly cliffhanger of all time. I wonder why this movie or Fast X couldn't do quite that. And I wonder if Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 will be the same way.",2023-06-02
"Sony did it again. This movie blows the first out of the water somehow and now I think Spider-man is my favorite franchise. Sony is doing a better job setting up the multiverse than MCU's Kang crap. There's so much happening on screen yet they still keep it understandable. The music, artwork, characters, it's all a masterpiece. Every single frame is some of the most creative and expressive stuff I've seen in modern media. Props to Sony Animation.",2023-06-02
"Honestly, no joke, this is the best piece of content I've ever experienced (not just movies, I'm including series and video games too).",2023-06-02
"it just fucking hit me, what “beyond the spider verse”means. It means beyond the universes where Spider-Man exists. Earth 42 is one of them, and we’re about to see more.",2023-06-03
"It's a tiny detail, but I loved that both Gwen and Miles had B's in classes for one of their native languages (English and Spanish, respectively), and both gave the excuse that they had just missed a few classes (because of being a superhero). Fun to catch the small details that show just how closely all of the spider-peoples' lives line up, even outside of the major canon events and the other characters in their lives.

Once again, outstanding animation which went beyond the style of the first movie, giving each universe its own distinctive flair and sometimes giving clues in scenes that didn't take place in the universe that we thought we were seeing (like when Miles's mom has green instead of brown eyes). An excellent sequel and great setup for a third film. If they can stick the landing this will end up being the most complete and consistent spiderman trilogy to-date, imo",2023-06-04
"Alright, unpopular opinion, but I felt like it dragged on at times, a lot of stuff definitely could have been taken out in my opinion",2023-06-04
Is anyone else really annoyed that they basically put the entire climax of the movie/Miles’ big moment in the trailers?? Couldn’t properly enjoy the entire Nueva York sequence because I felt like I’ve literally seen it twenty times.,2023-06-05
"It was a great movie. I went in not knowing it was a ""part 1"" and that left me disappointed.

I hate when movies end with ""to be continued"" and do not tell a complete story. It recently happened with Dune (yeah I understand that's how the book ends) and the newest Avatar (I feel like the second matrix movie ended without a real ending) -- they just come off as setups for the next flick. I may be weird about this, but I think that a movie should try to have some sort of conclusion. I get that there is more to the story, but try wrap up something. Maybe im just too used to the whole `discovery, conflict, resolution` approach that is in basically every movie or maybe im forgetting how other great multipart movies didn't tell whole stories in the individual movie.

Anyway, I'll be at opening weekend when the next one drops",2023-06-05
"I was crying through almost the entire Gwen intro. For so many reasons. I've been a massive Spider-Gwen fan since her books started and I never thought I'd see her story play out in a movie. Then the watercolor art style kicked in and I realized they were animating her scenes just like much of her cover art. Then it hit me that they were going through her whole origin. It was weird because I never felt strongly reading it, but I started bawling both when Peter died and when Captain Stacy turned on her. I knew it was coming but that just made it worse. They really did her justice and Hailee did such a great job.

  
Seeing the Mary Jane's and hearing them play was surreal. I'm wondering if we'll ever get Gwenom and/or Carnage Mary Jane in the all female spinoff that's been talked about.",2023-06-05
"I loved the movie. But sadly my experience was brought down by the people that like to fucking talk during the movie and explain it to their friends. I don't give a shit if you recognize an easter egg, your friends probably don't give a shit either. I don't know why this is becoming very common in movie theaters. And if you tell them to shut up they feel offended. I just wanted to vent.",2023-06-05
"The whole movie is fucking 10/10. I was on the edge of my seat in second half. Each frame is so beautiful to look at. For a moment I forgot it was two-parter and i believe whole theatre too cause of the collective “oh, c’mon” when that “To be continued” appeared on screen. The only slight very tiny tiny issue: the songs were no where as good as the first one.",2023-06-07
"Saw it last night and I can't stop thinking about it. That movie was an absolute masterclass in storytelling and animation. Not for a moment did I think it dragged and there were multiple times where I was just in awe of how beautiful every frame looked. It was almost distractingly gorgeous at times, and the way the soundtrack almost melded beat by beat to the frames was incredible. The whole beginning segment with the opening, then Gwen playing drums was just unreal animation, and the movie really didn't slow down. I am upset that Transformers is taking over the IMAX/Dolby screens because I'll definitely be seeing it one or two more times. The Spot was a perfect villian and the dilemma between the Spiderman 2099 crew vs. Miles was one where I still don't know what side I'd be on. Just unbelievably good.

My only complaint was the audio in some parts, especially at the beginning, was low in my theater to where I thought it wasn't nearly loud enough and I missed a few lines of dialogue.",2023-06-07

"Great start, tedious ending. Way to drawn out with his family stuff, we get it. Good movie but if they would have edited 20 mins or so it could have been fantastic.",2023-06-27
I didn't like that they made all the spider man just agree to the fact that they gotta let miles' father die. Most spider man wouldn't stand for that.,2023-06-02
"Probably in the minority here. The movie felt like it was edging me the whole time. Somehow I feel like it didn't really advance the story that much, it just kind of dragged. Love the animation and music just not the story",2023-06-03
Miguel really is the hero in this story. Miles is crazy,2023-06-03
That ending was one of the biggest movie mistakes I can think of. What were they thinking?,2023-06-03
"I wasnt the biggest fan compared to the first one.  Too much visual clutter for the sake of it, the parts with Miles' parents dragged, and I hated the cliffhanger.",2023-06-05

"I am so happy that we got an appearance and even a line from the Spectacular Spider-Man! A pretty standout line in an important scene, too.",2023-06-02
"Even knowing that this was only part 1, that ending seemed pretty abrupt. Otherwise? This was a straight up masterpiece, building upon everything that was amazing in Into the Spider Verse.

Not only is this film a celebration of everything Spider Man, it's a celebration of comics and animation as art forms (The return of the comic book covers, the different art styles of each universe, that gorgeous credits sequence). Need to watch it again!!",2023-06-02
I love that Spider-Man 2 PS5 game existing in Miles’ dimension implies that him and Ganke know there are versions of them that exists in the game. Also Donald Glover’s cameo made me wonder what Earth-19999 Aaron did that led him to become an anomaly and how he became Prowler. Also Spider-Punk is gonna be my personality for the whole year.,2023-06-02
So many fantastic emotional moments in this movie and the blending of all the different art styles is incredible. It really feels like a comic book come to life. The biggest issues I have is with it are that it feels really drawn out towards the second half and is such an unsatisfying ending. It's like watching an incomplete movie.,2023-06-02
"I will never emotionally recover from this cliff hanger. Holy SHIT what an amazing movie. I had pretty high expectations from the first one and this movie blew them out of the water like half way through. Just the visuals alone are a technical achievement! If this isnt strongly considered for best picture this year then the whole thing is rigged. 

Also a shower thought I had while driving home: what if the universe that didn't have its spiderman in it was our universe? Man that would have hit hard...",2023-06-02
"Great movie, but was it just my theater or was the sound mixing Nolan level in multiple parts? Right off the bat I could barely understand Gwen's opening monologue over the sound of the drums.

There were a few other parts where it was really bad as well.

EDIT: Should've looked more thoroughly through the comments before posting this, I see that a lot of people had the same issue.",2023-06-02
Seeing Spectacular Spider-Man holding Captain Staceys body was a really nice look into post Cliffhanger finale of the show about what he went through later on,2023-06-02
"Everything i could say about this I think I've already seen said in the comments so far, except:

- EVERYONE WAS WRONG ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I saw so many people worried about this movie because of the ""love triangle"" angle that got played up (by the media? by marketing? i'm honestly not sure where this came from) that...honestly isn't even really present in the movie at all? Plus concerns because of the writers. GOD WE WERE SO WRONG. 

- The soundtrack was INSANELY good. I don't think the licensed / pop music included was as impactful as it was in the first movie (there was no What's Up Danger for this movie, but now I understand why) - it was still good, it just didn't have that umph. But Daniel Pemberton with the original score? Hoooooly shit. He picked up the slack where the licensed music left holes - or rather, the filmmakers let him go wild and let him shine OVER the licensed stuff, which was honestly a perfect choice. Pemberton's score took themes from the first movie and wove them into new ones, elevated them into brand new mixes that still held the spirit of the original, GOD it was ear candy the whole time. There are so many reasons to watch this movie again but for me I need to just LISTEN to it again if nothing else.

- Animation has, for a long time, been seen as ""just a kids' genre"". This is false. As many have said, but especially Guillermo del Toro most recently, animation is not a genre, it's a medium. It is not just for kids. THIS. MOVIE. SHOWS. THAT. More and more ""kids"" movies these days are ""getting away"" with swearing, and in this one I counted multiple instances of hell and damn, two uses of ass, and a shit. I know swearing doesn't equal maturity but to me it speaks to the fact that they're not playing around. This movie is for everyone, and yeah kids will be entertained by the bright colors, but honestly they're not gonna get it!

- Beyond the language this movie has a lot of mature themes and things to say about choice and what you choose to do with your life. It's taking what the first movie did and expanding on those themes in new ways that are only possible if you treat your audience like adults. It's incredible and mature and so so so lovingly made and written and I honestly couldn't be happier with the way this turned out. I'm overjoyed we got one of these at all and to think the second one blew the original out of the water - a hard act to follow and an even harder one to improve upon. 

It's so hard to process my thoughts on this. As soon as the title card flashed at the end my theater erupted and I was right there with them. I honestly started crying because I was just so so happy. I knew about the Part 1 / Part 2 thing but I did actually forget, and at the time thought they dropped the title because a Part 2 was up in the air and they didn't want to bank on it so early. I thought this would be like the first movie - a neatly wrapped up story that didn't hinge on a sequel but would leave the potential opening for one if it did well enough. I'm so glad I was wrong and I can't wait to see what they do next.",2023-06-02
"It was a ton of fun and a worthy sequel but I don't think its better than the first. Really feel you could cut about 10-15 minutes and really get the pacing down pat, though admittedly you would be cutting good stuff. To sound like a wanker for a sec, it just felt a bit self indulgent at times compared to first one.

Still an incredible movie that i'm happily going to see a couple more times.",2023-06-02
"Love that they continued to prominently feature the [musical motifs](https://youtu.be/ozbKHKntpCc) for the spider characters and the hero’s journey from the first movie. I was geeking out every time I noticed them.

Not only that, but the more punk soundtrack that accompanied Gwen was just beyond excellent. The music in these movies is so damn good!",2023-06-02
"LOVED this movie, that scene where Miles said “Nah, Imma do my own thing” had me shook. 

I thought Hobie was gonna be the stereotypical  rival for Gwens interest, but he really won me over with his quips and morals. Love that he told Miles how to better use his electric blast thingy and Miles proceeded to use it to escape the cage and blast Miguel

Really loved the gang reassembling at the end, with the spider people from the previous movie and this one teaming up to help Miles

Although a quick question, did Miguel and co go to Earth 42 or Miles earth? Since the scene where they were waiting for Miles and when Miles was running home looked quite similar and were both in the rain.

Overall, enjoyed the hell out of this movie and cannot wait for the next one",2023-06-02
"Amazing film, much better written than nwh.",2023-06-02
"Anyone know the name of the chill rap song that plays before Gwen and miles have their upside down talk over the city?

I don’t think it’s a part of the soundtrack released",2023-06-02
"Did anyone else enjoy 2099's musical motif? It calls back to the 90s Spider-Man Unlimited theme. Damn, I'm starting to feel my age with that one.",2023-06-02
"Loved it.  Need to watch it again as I'm sure I missed a bunch of references here and there.

Five minutes before the ending I remembered this was part 1 of 2 and I was both mad and excited by it.

Even Spectacular Spider-Man popped in.

Q: Why was the father (Jeff Davis) wearing a MORALES name badge at the beginning?",2023-06-02

Can't wait for the sequel !",2023-06-02

Haven’t seen it yet but would someone who has mind letting me know if this is too scary for a five year old who has seen the first one at home but was pretty close to not being able to handle the opening scene when >!Peter dies!<. Anything that harrowing this time around?,2023-06-02

"The Spider-Verse team is really 2/2 so far. This was such a great movie in so many different ways. Definitely seems like it's the ""Empire"" of the trilogy. It's darker and doesn't end on a happy note, but there are sparks of hope for the next installment. I can't wait to see what they have in store next...",2023-06-03
"Great, no, fantastic movie. Top 3 animated films in my book. Something I don’t get though. If Miles is this O.G anomaly, to the point where his version of Spider-Man shouldn’t even exist. Why does his life/story have to be held to the canon events. I.e his uncle dying, his police captain dad having to die? He’s an anomaly. His very existence shows that they aren’t defined by the “script”? Maybe that’ll be a plot point in the next film? I feel like this should be obvious tho lol",2023-06-03

"Great watch. Only think I didn’t like was that they went the  “villain makes a little too much sense so we have to make him lose control and beat up the hero” route with Miguel. Also is every spider man evil now except Miles & co?  Obviously we don’t know what happens in the next film, just thoughts based on this one.",2023-06-03

"Incredible film that absolutely lived up to the first 

The visuals were off the charts, just a complete eyegasm and a masterpiece. I can’t think of any other film that competes visually

The plot of the first film is tighter and better as a stand-alone; but the overarching story this creates is excellent",2023-06-04

My only gripe…unless I missed it was that there was no Japanese Spiderman!! :( 

I was hoping we’d see a Mech or something in the background!!!",2023-06-04

Didn't realize A$AP Rocky is Earth-42 Miles,2023-06-04
"This was fun to watch. There were some slow moments that dragged on a bit too much. Some tropes should've been moved along quicker and the movie could've been shortened a bit. But the plot was great, animation and artstyle was incredible, cultural and movie references were great. Overall a 9/10.",2023-06-04
"Loved it. Now I have to watch the sequel. I am so disappointed in myself for not catching up on Miles being in the wrong universe, the spider from wrong universe motif has been written all over the wall. For someone who usually sees plot twists ahead of time, I am blind sighted this time around. 

The visuals and sounds are on point; this is one of those films of which the presentation and styles are so well made, to the point that the plot and characterization do not take the entirety of my focus. And no, I am not saying the movie is style over substances, because both the style and substances are spectacular. The movie is a full package.

The movie is emotional, touching while remaining to be hopeful and light hearted. If you are an adult like me, there are some very strong themes to enjoy, especially if you are a parent, or someone who struggles between maintaining the status quo due to pragmatic realism birthed by experience (Miguel) and optimistic idealism due to hope and faith (Miles). If you are someone whose interests are more about style, art, and music, then the movie is visually stunning and the music used are enchanting as well. This movie has something for anyone to enjoy.",2023-06-04
Good lord. As of 4600 ish votes the median rating is 10.,2023-06-04
"Absolutely stellar movie, even better than the first. I adored the different distinct art styles of each major character and their worlds. The opening with Gwen and her more impressionist world, with the colors bleeding and representing her emotional state, was a great choice. I loved Spider-Punk's cut and paste looks, reminiscent of so many photocopied punk zines from over the years.

I also found The Spot's evolving design really intriguing. When we first meet him, you can see pencil outlines, as if he's not yet finished. So when he goes from ""villain of the week"" to an eldritch abomination, it's so very striking.

The humor and action all played a role in telling the story; I could feel the care put into each scene and I honestly didn't realize two hours had passed. I'm honestly quite burned out on superhero films; nothing that's come out in the last few years (or scheduled for release this year) has captured my attention. But *Across The Spider-Verse* had me psyched from the first teaser. I can't wait to see the end of this trilogy; I feel confident that it will stick the landing.",2023-06-04
"Personally I think the ""Canon event"" concept works better in time travel stories than AU ones. 

Like I can see Brainiac 5 trying to stop Flash from saving Krypton from blowing up because otherwise there is no Superman and therefore no JLA or legion . That's a pretty straightforward cause and effect. But here they have to add The Universe explodes if Stacy doesn't die as an external cosmic punishment to make the plot work.",2023-06-05
"Visually stunning as expected. Pretty much every shot was gorgeous, easily the best looking movie of the year.
I guess my one complaint is the central dilemma. About how Spider-Man  is defined by tragedy and canon. Its absolutely a callout to various writers keeping Peter stuck in a permanent state of depression and how Spider-Man can and should evolve beyond certain set pieces. And of course Miles was never going to be okay with the fact that his father's death HAD to happen. I my issue is with how many Spider-Men/Spider-Women WERE okay with that fact.

Like, obviously not all the spider people were Peter Parker, and not all of those Peters may be the most upstanding Spider-Man, but I have a hard time believing that many Peter Parkers agreed with the idea that ""some people just have to die for the greater good.

For Example, you are telling me PS4 Spider-Man, who has a version of Miles on his world, and saw that version of Miles also lose his Father, saw what Miguel and the others were doing about Their Miles and was like, ""alright, seems cool to me?"" I can't accept that.",2023-06-05

"I'm so happy they tied in the Prowler-Miles into this. One tiny moment I loved in ""Into the Spiderverse"" was Miles's spider-sense changing colors from purple/green to red/blue when first meeting Peter Parker. While this did get Peter killed, it was also the incident that turned Miles onto the path of Spiderman rather than Prowler. But with Part 2, we'll get to see what it would have been like if that hadn't happened.",2023-06-05
"I've been hearing that there's an Evangelion reference regarding Peni, what's the reference?",2023-06-05
"Honestly, no one in this movie was unlikeable to me. I understood everyone's point of view, be it Miguel's crushing need for every Spider-Man to ""stick to the script"" because of his own failure, Miles' persistence to save his father and do his own thing, Gwen's uncomfortable middle ground seeing Miles.

One other thing, the original songs, just like the first movie, were amazing. I'm listening to it on Spotify at this very moment

I loved it, and I will be happy to walk into the theaters next year to see Part 2",2023-06-05

"I didn’t like spider punk in the beginning, but by the end, he was one of my favourite characters. His little plants around the story to bring the original group back together were fantastic. 

One thing I was thinking too was, could Miguel also be an anomaly? We didn’t get a massive delve into his past. Who was his captain? Why isn’t he funny? He wasn’t bitten by a spider, he active injects himself with an agent that makes him Spider-Man. Was there a Peter Parker in his universe that died?

Also is the universe being destroyed by an anomaly the same as an incursion in the MCU?",2023-06-05
"Beautiful film. I came for the visuals and I was not disappointed. They really went wild and abstract with the backgrounds.

All the characters are perfectly balanced. Gwen is great, Miles is a boss, Miguel is a beast, Jessica is a badass. Hobie was lots of fun and Peter is still the best version of the character in any movie. Comics fans should be over the moon with his portrayal. Even more, all the references to the actual comics stories and all the different Spidermen were a real treat. Ben Reilly was a joke character but still really well done. They even threw in the one-off costume from one of my favorite Spidey stories.

The music wasn't as good. The pacing didn't have that *snap* that gave the first movie so much energy. I missed that. The emotional family stuff was done well for the most part, but for the sake of pacing, I would cut about ten minutes of it. All the canon stuff is kind of a desperate contrivance but they still managed to beat out a better Spiderverse story than what's in the comics. I understand they had sequel setup work to do in the end but it really should have wrapped up quickly after the third act chase. 

My biggest problem is the pacing and that's the one thing keeping Across the Spiderverse from being better than the first movie.",2023-06-05

"I highly doubt anyone will see this but I'm really starving out here for my sanity. There was this lo-fi like sound/song that was happening during Gwen's Story that happens probably within the first 10 to 15 minutes of the story. I just felt so immersed and loved every inch and fiber of what I was hearing that I'm looking for any answers to find it but my own powers I cannot find anything, definitely a skill issue on my part.

If someone can help me isolate and/or find this sound please respond I would love to hear it again.  


Even if it's a ripped copy of the Entire Gwen scene and you're able to help me watch it again I'd love that, just so I could try to find that song/sound. Thank you",2023-06-06

"——————- SPOILER ——————-

My theory on what could happen in Beyond the Spider Verse:

Miles lands in earth-42 where the spider that bite him is from. He is then captured by a variant of himself and at first glance it made it seem like he was the villain on earth-42, but if you notice some details of earth-42 it’s kind of like an inverted version of the earth miles is from. 

When he tells his story to his variant he mentions specifically “OUR Dad” and his variant corrects him by saying “No Your Dad”. It’s important because it seems like the variant didn’t like his dad or despised him in a way, it’s possible that his dad in earth-42 was a dirty cop helping the sinister 6 (crime group who run the show in this reality) and variant Miles ended up killing him. Now variant miles thinks that all versions of his dad are evil or corrupt. This would imply that variant miles is kind of an Anti-Hero with the prowler alter-ego and could be on a dark path. 

During the into the spider verse movie a miserable Peter b Parker came to help a misguided Miles Morales and the relationship themes amongst the two was very mentor like. I believe this could also be the same dynamic between Miles(earth-1610) and his variant (earth-42). In a way his variant could very well be the answer to the solution he’s looking for regarding a potential error in canon events.",2023-06-07
"I'm guessing they'll touch on it in the sequel since they drew attention to it, but what was up with Miguel injecting himself with that little gun?

I mean, if someone wanted to get rid of Spiderman for good, he would make it so they are all in the same place.

They also wouldn't know any better, to them, he is just another Spiderman after all.

-	2099’s universe already had a peter parker right? and he wasn’t bitten by a spider either, so i think it’s funny that he’s giving miles shit for that.

"Based on what I can gather so far from it both sides Miles and Miguel are right and wrong in their own ways.

Miles in that you really shouldn't just stand around and let something happen without trying anything.

While Miguel is right to put the safety of the greater whole over what would ultimately be a selfish desire.

I can see where Miguel is coming from in his really hellbent drive to stop Miles from trying to defy what can be considered destiny at this point being one hell of a bad idea since as most other media has shown that doesn't just bend over and let the the hero win regardless of their choice improbable or how ridiculous or nonsensical it would be in reality defying it in a way it didn't like and you're probably gonna wind up making things worse.

Some holes I found in the whole Gwen's dad argument is that in her case her dad is just no longer the captain she may lose.

She just winded up replacing the target not removing the event itself.

What's to say who will replace him in his role isn't someone she's either equally as close to or will grow too.

Or he winds up getting back to the role later on due to unforseen and uncontrollable circumstances.

Canon events are describe as less things that are gonna happen immediately and more like an eventuality.

So by all means using her as an example doesn't work as a way to say it can be stopped more like delayed.

Another one is the whole Miles and the one who was supposed to be bitten universes not tearing themselves apart.

Yeah if you look at it and focus on them not tearing apart it looks like proof that Miles maybe right.

But then if you actually think about it instead it becomes obvious what happened instead was just a simple role swap.

Miles already had the makings of becoming the Prowler of his universe so the opposite can be inferred that his counterpart had the makings of becoming Spiderman instead.

But because of the mix up the universe instead worked with what it has it just role swapped them hence why it wasn't tearing itself apart.

Yes we know there are holes in Miguel's working theory but so far all we've seen is Mile's not so much as proving them wrong and more doing a bit of both.

They can be altered but so far everytime he tried there was some disastrous results Indian spiderman (Sorry forgot her name) universe being destabilized by The Spot is prime example so far.

Honestly at this point I hope the third movie acts more of a wake up call for Miles while also being one for Miguel.

Miles in that he gets to finally realize that choices and actions can have consequences even if they were done with the best of intentions since some of the greatest atrocities in history were done with just that the best of intentions and you have to take accountability and responsibity for them whether you intended it or not.

Miguel in that no he doesn't have to try and shoulder the responsibility by himself there are people who are willing to help him with it because the more he tries the more his starting to buckle under the pressure.

I've found it weird also that most argue Tom Spiderman would side with Miles.

If anything he'd side with both of them and try and get them to understand each other.

Since at this point his walked in both of their shoes quite literally.

He's been where Miles was at in having the childish belief his invincible and can accomplish anything and because his doing the right thing.

Doing just as Miles did almost destroyed his universe only to be averted and the consequence being it got his Aunt May to die by the end of it.

And his been where like Miguel he's has in that he has to make the choices that caused him the most pain in the end with him erasing himself from everyone's mind just to keep them safe and keep his universe from being torn apart.",2023-06-18
"The movie was amazing, in terms of plot, art style, direction, animation, dialogues - everything. 

However I am still not getting one thing - what is the intent of Universe 42's Prowler to hold back miles in their universe. Maybe that miles wants to take place of our miles in 6016 to meet his dad?",2023-06-19
"Okay, so I could definitely be wrong and this is more a question than me pointing out a plothole but here we go -

So we know that the spider that bit Miles in into the spiderverse was from earth 42. We know it altered something in him because the ho home machine retinal scans him to be from earth 42 and sent him there. 

We know that people from the wrong universe glitch in a different universe without a watch or a band that stabilised them. 

If Miles is from Earth 42 according to the DNA scans how come he doesn't glitch when he's from whatever earth he actually is from? (I've forgotten the number)",2023-06-23
"I have a theory (warning, spoilers ahead) …

The reason why the universe Miguel visited got destroyed isn’t because he stopped a canon event. It’s because he stole his doppelgänger’s family without even telling the family that person died. He was trying to replace a dead guy which is unconscionable and goes against what Spiderman would do. That’s why that universe was swallowed by a black hole, because Miguel did something wrong and violated the laws of the Spider-verse.

Every-time a Spiderman does something with bad intentions, a blackhole appears. I think all those other spider-people in Miguel’s universe are creating more blackholes by their inaction. They are willingly letting people die and even abetting their deaths for the sake of preserving canon events. 

Spiderman’s character isn’t designed to be like that. If there’s a chance he can save people, he will take it. He will try to save everyone, instead of sacrificing one person to save the rest of the world. He doesn’t pick and chose who dies. That’s why Miles saving his father won’t destroy his universe.",2023-06-26

"I have questions in no particular order.

\- Why did the Indian Spiderman know about the society when his ""canon event"" didn't even happen yet?

\- If the whole Spot thing is ""not canon"" then why was the Indian captain supposed to die there?

\- Why did they even bother going to the Indian's spiderman's world in the first place? If they did manage to stop the Spot in time then the captain wouldn't have been in danger either, thus he wouldn't need to be saved. Thus, causing an anomaly. This whole ordeal makes 0 sense to me.

\- If Miles is an anomaly, then why is his universe not already on the verge of destruction like the Indian spiderman's universe is after saving the captain? Saving the Captain immediatly caused the world to almost to crubme. But Miles become Spiderman which was not supposed to happen has no effect on the intregry of the universe? Huh?

... I can totally see Miles thinking, 'Sure, you like being around me. Enough to stay the fuck away from me for 16 months.'

"This movie made me feel old and I'm just in my early 30s. My eyes and head hurt from all the visual overload. 

Everytime there's a fight, it's like there's something going on in every corner of the screen every nano second. I love the choreography and creativity but I don't know where to focus because everything is happening too fast, with texts and info popping up in between. I love the unique and gorgeous artstyles in every universe but most of them are a blast of contrasting color and nonstop imagery. If I watched this in a theater, I probably would've gotten a seizure with Hobie's backstory. I feel like this was animated with a lethal dose of ADHD medication.

Still tho I freakin loved this movie. Probably the best movie (and trilogy) for me ever since super hero movies started dipping in the multiverse. Short and concise but also heartfelt stories for the supporting cast. The universes are actually explored and given life. Plot twists that are cleverly hinted on early, even on the first movie. And my personal favorite is that there's none of that overdone, tension-breaking, cheap jokes from the MCU. Every funny and emotional scene here landed for me. 

It's not only a great superhero movie, it's also a great Family Movie. I hope they don't rush the 3rd one and give the animators proper breaks and compensation. I'm hopeful that this trilogy is shaping up to be one of the best superhero AND animated movies of all time.",2023-08-09

"Late to the party and no one will probably read this. I feel like I’m getting old.

Other times so much was happening I couldn’t concentrate on the scene, like the first fight scenes with the Spot where it was difficult to see how exactly they were fighting.

I don’t remember feeling the same way with the first one. No issues whatsoever with everything else other than the weird sound mix as others mentioned. I agree with the movie’s rating, definitely an excellent film.

Maybe I just need to rewatch it earlier in the day when my eyes aren’t tired from work yet.",2023-08-24
"When I first heard of ""Into the spider-verse"" I never gave it my attention simply because it was ""animated"".

Oh boy was I a big idiot for thinking that. These two movies are the best fucking thing I watched in years.

Plot , characters , graphics,VA, you name it, it's all so good.

The one piece of criticism I can offer is the fact that some scenes tend to have too much going on I feel like it's effort that goes unappreciated because your eyes can't catch up to it. (Maybe my poor ability to concentrate when too much is going on has to do with it). But that is in no way disturbing the experience ofc . I just , don't want the talented people behind the animations to burn out working on details people may not notice , have some deserved rest you know and I do hope they're being paid well for the quality I've seen.

This movie is just amazing 🔥.",2023-09-03
I actually had difficulty understanding the movie due to rapid dialogue and strange pacing.  Far cry from the first movie in terms of quality in my view.  A challenge most sequels fail at.  By the end I was left feeling bland and uncaring.  I'm not very invested in how this all ends.,2023-11-06

"It seems like I'm in the minority on this one but I was disappointed by this movie. The visuals were just too overwhelming at times (that first battle between Vulture and Gwen/Miguel/Jess was particularly hard to follow) and the sound mixing was awful, though I think that was partially my theater's fault, they seemed to crank up the volume way too high early in. But the main reason I'm disappointed is because of the ending. I'm ok with a cliffhanger ending, but not when it doesn't feel like an ending at all. There is no resolution, there is no completion of Miles' arc. Infinity War is what a cliffhanger ending should be: a movie that gives us a proper ending, and a resolution to the main character's journey: it still functions on its own as its own individual movie that doesn't need Endgame to be complete. This movie doesn't function at all as its own film, especially when the first half of this movie is basically all setup. I think I will like this film more when Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out and the story is actually complete, but right now I'm frustrated at how incomplete this was.",2023-06-05
"Let me preface this by saying that I fully understand that I'm in the minority on this.

The ending really took the wind out of the sails for me. I knew it was a two-parter going in, but I was incredibly dissatisfied with the actual cliffhanger. Nothing happens and there's no real immediate threat. Miles is the wrong universe? Not a problem. There's hundreds of Spider-People who can travel to any dimension with the press of a button and they're all looking for him. Gwen was able to survive in his world for a week in ITSV, so the glitching isn't an issue. Miguel and his crew want to stop Miles? Not an issue. He already single-handedly defeated them all and they are shown to be mostly idiots. Even the main villain is a non-threat. Despite looking extremely cool, he does nothing to solidify himself as an actual danger. He's such a non-threat that the movie completely ignores him for the entire third act.

People keep comparing it to Empire Strikes Back or Infinity War, but I don't think that's true. Empire builds to Luke confronting Vader. That's what he's training for and why Vader is building his trap. Infinity War revolves entirely around Thanos's snap and ends with him completing his goal. Those movies, Two Towers, Back to the Future Part 2 - they all give the characters a clear mission at the start and conclude that particular story. This just stops halfway, not because it's a good stopping point but because they ran out the clock.

Again, just to be clear, I loved this movie and I'll see Beyond opening night, but that cliffhanger absolutely missed the mark for me.",2023-06-06

"There are things in this movie that are absolutely amazing. The animation is even better than ITSV (the stuff in Gwen’s universe and in Nueva York particularly), Hobie is an amazing new character, I love Gwen’s arc with her dad, the structural and thematic writing were good.

But I really did not enjoy watching it. Most of the movie that isn’t the Pre-Credits sequence with Gwen and the Nueva York sequence did not really work for me. The pacing felt WAY off, I did not like Miles, I did not like his Dad. The dialogue writing and performances on those characters felt weirdly off. The ending “falling action” was bizarre and it felt like they added climactic music and chopped that part up to make it feel like an ending but it ended up feeling like a bad music video.

Also oh my god the sound mix????? What the fuck was going on - how did this release in that state?

I’m gonna wait til I see the next one to see if this pays off and try a rewatch. I hope so but honestly a really frustrating watch because it should have been amazing.",2023-06-04
First one was way better. This doesn’t even come close except for animation and style. Yes animation is mind blowing and gets even better with this one. But in terms of story and plot this one felt very lazy writing and cliche cookie cutter characters. The Indian version was a complete stereotype character. And it felt too long. They could easily cut 45 mins to an hour and it wouldn’t change anything. Disappointed overall!,2023-06-05
"The more I think about this movie the less it makes any sense.

The main conflict is between Miguel, who wants to allow Miles' dad to die and preserve the canon, versus Miles, who wants to save his dad no matter what. Except, every spiderman obviously *tries* to save their universe's Captain, so Miles trying to save his own universe's Captain wouldn't even be a problem, he'd just fail. Pavi tries to save Captain Singh and is going to fail, it is the interference of other universe Spidermen (Miles) that breaks canon.

So Miguel's plan to trap Miles and make sure he can't be involved in his own universe's canon event makes no sense. Maybe you could argue that Miguel is either crazy or evil, or has hidden motives, etc. But he also convinces hundreds of other spidermen to go along with this nonsense, as shown in the ""intervention"" scene, so that doesn't even work to fix the plot hole.

Also, Miguel's plan must have been hatched sometime during the Mumbattan section, because directly before that Gwen is explicitly told *not* to interfere with Miles. What about the intervening events changed things so dramatically? I can't begin to guess and the movie certainly doesn't offer even a word of explanation.

So those are the actual plot holes. I would say there is also a huge storytelling problem because the main issue, the canon breaking, is completely abstract and imaginary. It's literally, ""our computer models are telling us to do this"". This is just, what the hell. Incredibly weak storytelling. Imagine if, instead of a big scary Death Star that we see blow up a whole planet in the first act, Star Wars was all about ""our computer models show that the Empire will win unless we follow the invisible Way of the Force, which has no physical manifestation and is not spelled out clearly in any way.""",2023-06-04

Visually it was stunning. So many art styles in one movies (including live action).

Soundtrack…fantastic, one of the highlights of the movie.

I’m looking forward to the next one though, and I’ll defo watch this again at some point.",2023-06-05
"Hmm.. So just want to vent abit here. The movie is great animation and music wise, however i have so many bones to pick with the story and the way it ended. I feel like half of it is definitely due to the feeling the movie left me with the to be continue thing, but I also just hate how they characterize every other spiderman in this movie. Like... 2099 make sense, he tried to break the so called canon event himself and suffer the consequences of it, so it make sense that he have a personal feelings towards said issue. But I cant for the life of me believed that the rest of the spidy, least of all Peter B Parker and Gwen would ever agreed to ""not try"" again when they could have save someone, especially if that someone is Miles's father. Granted they make their own team in the end against the other spidy and all but they should have never even agreed with it to begin with. Also the idea of canon event in itself is stupid. Like we see how easily it can ""break"" just because Gwen dad decided to not be a cop anymore, and you cant tell me across an infinite universe that doesn't happen at all until Gwen and Miles turn. On that topic if 2099 called Miles an anomaly why would he even be so sure that Miles would follow all other spider in their canon event? Also why would a multiverse be a thing if all event is supposed to playout the same anyway? Are all of them expected to go down the zombie path just because 1 zombieverse existed somewhere? Or maybe all universe will be destroyed by Dr Strange because he did it in multiple universe? They even reference the MCU Strange event so is the canon rule only applied to spidy or what?

But again i guess im just feeling so mad at all these details mainly because of the to be continue thing, and i would have overlooked alot of them without that thing, so who knows...",2023-06-06

At the start of the movie, group next to me starts screaming “ARE YOU ALL READY FOR THIS????”  Then someone behind us says “shut up” and the kid next to me says “f you loser” and I thought I was about to experience a full blown brawl. 

At the end of the movie, all I hear is disappointment and people throwing up their arms. Kid to the other side of me yells “I really paid $20 for that garbage?” Also, I can’t forget how everyone around me was on their phone for what feels like half the movie. 

I had such an incredible time other than that and would do anything to watch it again but with no one else in the theater. I feel like the younger generation does not have a clue how to act in a theater or just simply doesn’t care",2023-06-04
The Spot going from villain of the week committing low level theft to a multiversal eldritch god that probably not even an Infinity Gauntlet could take care of was a delight to watch.,2023-06-04
Literally didn’t feel like 2 hours at all. Now I’m going to spend my entire summer rewatching this movie and agonize over waiting for Beyond The Spiderverse. That cliffhanger had me going insane,2023-06-04
"That was the best shot, the best scored, and the prettiest movie I have EVER seen. 

The only things it loses points on is the beginning fight with the vulture, as much as I loved it, did go on for a bit too long. That, and there were just a few (like, 3-5) too many jokes placed at bad moments. The one that stuck out the most was when Miguel was explaining all this heavy shit to Miles and Spider-Punk cuts in with a one-liner that kills the mood ever so slightly.

Overall: 9.6/10",2023-06-05
"This movie proved that there is no superhero fatigue, only bad movie fatigue.

There are *so many* variants of so many characters, and just as many locations. Yet all the same, the movie remains concise and engaging. The duration is the only element that I had an issue with. Granted, it's been a while since the first movie, but all the same, most character introductions and recaps were unnecessary. And many dialogue scenes were far too long.

EDIT: Spelling.",2023-06-05
"Late to the party but I just got out of the theater and wow. Overall I loved it.

Pros:

- That was the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen. You could take a still image of ANY moment in this movie and it would be just incredible art. 

- the story was great. It hit typical super hero beats while being its own thing. 

- the music fit very well

- the different spidies were dope

Cons:

- the ending… what a tease. People in my theater literally wtf’d out loud. It was so abrupt. 2 hours of build up for it to just end like that man… 

- the mixing was awful. I thought it was just my theater but apparently it wasn’t that. The dialogue was low, the music not loud but louder than the dialogue. They really need to do something about it because it was really distracting at first how quiet this movie was.

- I’m torn on how I feel about the villain. I like the on the nose theme of him and it was cool how he evolves throughout the movie, but we never get to see that pay off (which you can kind of blame the ending for)

Anyways, solid 9/10 for me. If this movie was 3 hours with the last 40 dedicated to the ending it would be been even better.",2023-06-05
"Utterly amazing film from beginning to end. Explored the tropes of being a superhero and the entire spider-man mythos while still being visually fantastic, full of action and lots of fun. 

It's my favourite film of the year and if the finale is anything like the first two it's going to be a classic cinema trilogy up there with Star Wars and LOTR.",2023-06-05
"Well that was a goddamn work of art. Gwen’s world is the most beautiful animation I have probably seen. 

Only small gripes for me is I felt the movie was a slight bit too long, and I also felt like Spot’s origin reminded me of Jamie Foxx’s Electro in TASM 2. The nerdy guy who wants to be noticed or appreciated by Spiderman to the villain who wants to destroy Spiderman for casting him aside. Clearly, Spot is better but that parallel was weird for me.",2023-06-05
"Great movie, got some criticisms i haven't seen anybody mention though 

\- **Sound** **mix**, i don't know if this is IMAX specific but the sound mix was the worst i've personally experienced in a movie theatre 

The music was booming, the action fx were soft and the voices were even softer - it felt like my brain was an ai taking sentence fragments and formulating the rest. 

\- The first 1/4 of the movie with Gwen really dragged for me, again maybe because of the mix i wasn't as immersed but while it was interesting it felt wayy too slow

\- Specific nitpick but i thought the scene where Gwen comes out of Miles room was weird, his parents really didn't react enough for me lol the girl just comes out of his room, tells them she came through the window and Miles is missing

\- Also i loathed every second of ""the dot"" he was just really annoying, a cool villain idea but was so annoying and i was very happy his screen time was like 25%",2023-06-07
"Anyone else think that Gwen will die in the next movie? I feel like the movie foreshadowed that Miles' parents will be saved but Gwen won't survive. 

They gave her closure with her dad in this movie, and added foreshadowing by telling us nothing good happens to Gwen and Spiderman. Also, her telling her dad she'll be right back kinda sealed it for me.",2023-06-07
"Definitely enjoyed the first more could definitely tell this movie was made by a different director, the third act pacing was abit all over the place and too long imo and i wish got more from 2099, but i loved everything else about this movie especially the soundtrack and visuals",2023-06-17
One thing I was confused about was Miles not using his invisibility when he was getting chased by the spiderman army in Nueva York. Did I miss a crucial piece of info here?,2023-06-02
I think I like the 1st one more.  There was too much family talk growing up bs and the 1st had plenty of that don't get me wrong.....I dunno it was alright not enough action in my opinion,2023-06-06
Great film. But disappointed with the music. Then again the first one set the standard so high it was impossible to match up. Especially with Sunflower and Whats up danger. Felt the film was missing that vibe song that went great with the story. Oh well hoping for that in the next film though.,2023-06-06
"I loved most of movie

&#x200B;

But Seeing ALL the spider-men, but miles go ""yea we just let them die and we are gunna stop you from trying"" was the most un spider-man thing I have seen in my life, Actually a bunch of spider-man teaming up together to do it? even worse, Spider-men are supposed to do the right thing no matter what and find a way to fix the consequences cause thats who they work

I mean shit even OG spider-man tries to stop him for a bit, the fuck?

&#x200B;

So anyways 

Fucking hated that",2023-06-06
"The movie was good but not 9/10 good, it was not as good as the first one.


The visuals were again very good although at certain times there were far too many shit happening in very little time which was annoying to watch. Other than that 10/10. 

The story however, the story suffered a bit, my best guess it's because they made it into a two part series which I didn't knew about before going to see it. 

It felt like often times we were dragging on and on without going anywhere, miles has the same talk with his parents like 3-4 times and I seriously don't understand why he thinks that his parents will not love him if he tells them he is Spiderman. 

Gwen is scared because her father hates spiderwoman and hunts her down, but Miles? His dad and law enforcement have a good relationship with miles as Spiderman and the previous Spiderman has left a good legacy for the people. So their struggle should be, his parents worrying about his safety and wanting him to stop doing it. 

The spider lady being very pregnant and on a bike should not have been on the main Spiderman 2099 team but just another background Spiderman. It just looks so silly. 

Finally I can't help but notice that Peter B Parker is still kinda a joke, sure he did get to fight his demons, make up with mj and seemingly have a nice life but why does he have to walk around with a pink robe and have his kid with him? Can't mj look out for the kid while her husband is busy saving the multiverse? 

Feels like they try to keep the the one that looks the more like the OG Spiderman as a joke in fear of him stealing miles' thunder. If the team of Spiderman was actually a small elite force as Gwen first said (thus no pregnant lady cmon) I could understand our boy from 616 not being there, but then we find out that literally every dimension's spiderman is over there so where is the OG??? 

Also the web stuff was kinda silly for me, Miguel was able to track 5he webbof destiny and see that mile's father was bound to die in 2 days, so you are telling me that dude can literally see the future? How about going a bit past that point to see how events play out?

Also web of destine and shit but madam web nowhere to be seen... Sad.",2023-06-09
Animation saved the movie. Pretty mid movie over all. First one was significantly better,2023-06-11
"Animation was great, but I couldn't help but feel with all of the different Spidermen it kind of cheapens the character itself - like why should I care about Miles Morales if there's another million universes with other Spidermen? The plot was also nothing special imo; those saying this is the greatest superhero film of all time are sprouting hyperbole.

**Overall rating for Across the Spider-Verse (2023): 7/10. Amazing animation but personally wasn't invested in the characters.**",2023-06-11
I can't be the only one who saw the massive trans imagery in Gwen's entire universe?,2023-06-03
"Am I the only one who is of the opinion that Miguel O'Hara was actually right all along and he really is the good guy and should be the leader? 

Because going through all these comments it looks like everyone is clearly on Miles' side. Even though he's risking the destruction of a whole universe. 

It may just be me, but I hate the trope of much lovey-dovey little feelings and emotions taking precedence over the perseverance of the UNIVERSE!

The story makes it very obvious that disrupting a canon event can easily snowball into destroying the universe eventually. 

So at the cost of 1 single person's life we should risk all of existence? What an awful idea. Another way of thinking about this is say that you know that you are about to approach a fork in the road. 1 direction leads to a non-zero (albeit an unquantified) chance that the entire universe will eventually end at the end of this road. Meanwhile, the other direction leads to a ZERO chance that this will happen. But in order to take the second option you must pay the price of 1 life. 

What a cheap and low price. That's a steal. Almost literally!

For sure it's not fun and very sad for the immediate circle of the 1 life that's sacrificed, but what you gain in return easily justifies the cost in such mind boggingly and nigh-incomprehensibly huge ways that this is a no-brainer. 

Also, Miles (and nobody else here) seems to realize that he's not actually saving his dad...by stopping The Spot from killing his dad he may very well guarantee that the whole universe dies (the one where his dad dies with it, and even his mom too, lol!) so he's literally doing nothing actually. 

Don't know the name of this trope, but it needs to die already.",2023-06-07
"OH DAMN DONALD GLOVER IS CONFIRMED MCU PROWLER. So the Hypno Hustler Movie is bullshit right? It’s really a Prowler movie? 

Uh yeah I’m fulfilled and happy and my life is wonderful. And I still have another movie left. Just fucking visual splendor ramped up to 11. The vertical train sequence was a thing of beauty. It’s the Empire Strikes Back of Spider Man movies. Breaking everyone down to the lowest low. Straining the relationship between not just Miles and Gwen, but Peter B too. A Spiderdad figure, mentor, and now literally a Spider dad. Mayday is adorable. 

But the best part is really the imposter syndrome that’s dropped on Miles. Pulling apart the confidence he built in Into with the reveal that he’s the only Miles in the Spiderverse because the spider was an anomaly. The recap sequence with him swinging through everything he’s gone though is a beauty. With the confidence to end it on THAT? With a dark mirror held up to Miles of the fact that in Earth-42 Jefferson’s death makes him the Prowler? Balllsy, very interesting, can’t wait to see where we pick up. 

And on a personal note, it’s hit my heart so hard to see my guy Miguel O’Hara in this. There was the joy in the first and this movie of seeing Miles speak Spanish and a little Spanglish with his mom. Now I get that AND the Spiderman I grew up reading on the big screen being hilarious in Spanish and straight up saying “Ay Coño!”. There’s power in representation and I just as elated as I was the first time around. They even kept him as the 90’s Edgelord!

9.5/10, but I’m confident it’ll be a 10 when combined with Beyond. This is two halves of a great story.",2023-06-02
"I really wanted to love this movie but I just could not get on with it. While I enjoyed the awesome art style and music even more than I did in the first one, I felt the plot to be muddled, the pacing was well out of whack and the writing was weak. Lots of trite repetitive dialogue and eye-rolling quips and then the ending was the cherry on top for my shit sundae.

Still tho, looking forward to the next one as I'm really interested in the villains they set up and I'm expecting it to be more focussed.",2023-06-05

Each lord of the ring movie or Star Wars movie had a beginning, middle and end. This Spider-Man had no end.",2023-06-02
"This movie kinda ruins the principles of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is meant to be someone that tries and save everyone no matter the consequences. But then we see a group of Spider-Man that we do know( Insomniac, Spectacular, the gang from the previous movie) and they just let people die cause they ‘have to’. And they’re all ok with it( I mean they got some slight conflicting feelings but they do it and do it often) but it’s a good movie I just hope the next movie we see miles be a bit more aggressive to them and call their actions out and they don’t make a joke about it.",2023-06-03
"Just finished watching it. I liked it overall but it got to be too much in some places. Just so jarring and sporadic. And the ending really came out of nowhere. What’s the third movie going to be?

Also I’m pretty much multiversed out after this.",2023-06-04

I’m way more worried about Miles’s mom than I am his dad,2023-06-02
"I think the track of the second movie seems abundantly clear, and that makes me even more excited. Miles defeats himself in a symbolic battle, just in time for Miles' friends to arrive and see the outcome of this battle. The two battling Spiderpeople teams converge in Miles universe as the Spot begins his attack. Miles saves his father despite the other teams best effort to stop him and guess what -- they were wrong. The Spider-people team up and take down The Spot, not without a couple casualties probably. Gwen and Miles proclaim their love, Miles tells his parents the truth, and the Spider people are no longer dedicated to protecting the canon but protecting as many lives as they can, no matter what. Something like that. 

Also, one random prediction: Hobie is gay! The air of the ""love triangle"" is taken out when we realize that Hobie is gay and his support for Gwen has nothing to do with any romantic feelings between them. Just seems like a weird joke they'd do on Miles that he'd been jealous for no reason.",2023-06-02
"my whole theater groaned at the cliffhanger.

6/10 for me. Enjoyed it more than the first but I guess these movies just aren’t for me unfortunately.,2023-06-02
"My favorite theme of the film was this idea that miles IS SPIDER-MAN. Harkening back to when he was first announced, all of the racism, backlash, anger. It was so odd to see all that play out, and then miles goes on to be beloved and the rest is history. 

But that idea that, no one wanted him to be spider-man, he was NEVER supposed to be spider-man… and it doesn’t matter cause he’s just gonna be his own spider-man anyways. 

Beautiful and a true love letter to miles morales.",2023-06-02
Hobie is truly the iciest mf in the whole movie.,2023-06-02
"Everyone be talking about Hobie which is fair but goddamn Pavitr Prabhakar stole the entire show for me. When I was walking home after the film all I could think about was the sounds and colours of Mumbaihattan, he's just so fun and talky and witty and his design looks fucking sick. I was so sad he wasn't as featured going on, but...

Not as sad as the noticeable lack of a certain emissary from hell :(",2023-06-02

"As someone who was disappointed with Spyder-Byte, and her being the only Black woman Spider-Woman in the comics - her depiction and backstory was much improved here.

Jessica Drew was amazing too, and it was quite the relief to see bw be an active non-vr Spider-Woman with actual powers. I feel the comics always dropped the ball on that. The same way they never let Miles and Miguel interact.

Hobie was an absolute delight.

And Scarlet Spider had be cackling. I need a scene with him and Spider-Man Noir in the next one.

I really liked the callback to the glitching spider of the first film.

The second film can't land fast enough eventhough I've got to rewatch this one at least another three times.

This definitely deserves a second best animation Oscar.",2023-06-02
"I quite liked the movie. That aside I really think the story had more problems than Spot's spots. So you are telling somehow Miguel is the bad guy here? Every word he said aside from the angry YOU ARE A MISTAKE, was the absolute truth. Miles is acting like a total dumb teenager (which is admiteddly fitting). And the India scene where they act like saving the police officer was so important while the fallen Alchemax building rips through several skyscrapers killing possibly thousands and they save what 20-30 people? Could go on but don't want to sound overly negative.",2023-06-02
"Did anyone else think the scene where Gwen and Miles keep thinking ""Shoot' while watching the hologram showing how Spot gained further powers was an homage to the famous scene in[ the Wire where the two detectives work a crime scene and only say ""fuck""?](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3n34oj)",2023-06-03
"Really great overall, though I preferred the first one. The animation was just as good as the original, as was the voice cast, script, direction and music. I loved the Spot, he was a much more effective villain than Kingpin and probably my favourite character in the film overall, managing to strike a great balance between being humorous and being threatening. I also really liked Miguel, Spider-Man India and Peter B. Lots of great easter eggs and references as well.

As for weaknesses, I thought the sound mixing made dialogue quite hard to hear, and the animation, while beautiful, was a bit too frenetic to follow during fight scenes, though neither of these were a deal breaker. My biggest issue with the film is its plot, which is a substantial downgrade compared to the first. Putting aside that most of it is just set-up and exposition for the next film, resulting in pacing issues and flabbiness compared to the much tighter plot of the first film, how the film handles the >!""canon"" concept is a complete misunderstanding of Spider-Man as a character. It was especially egregious to see Peter essentially refer to Uncle Ben as a necessary sacrifice. There is just no way Peter, or any other Spider-Man, would just stand aside and let people die. They would try and save everyone, and even if they failed, they would try again, and again, until they succeeded. Miles was the only one to act in character on that point, which is pretty eye-rolling. If your plot requires you to character assassinate most of your main cast in order for it to work, it needs a re-think, and if the whole canon aspect turns out to be nonsense in the third film (as I suspect it will), then all but one of the Spider-Men in the multiverse have been made accessories to murder. Abysmal.!<

Still, as I said, overall, the ride was very enjoyable, despite the plot issues. I'm looking forward to the final instalment, hopefully it will address some of the problems here.",2023-06-03
"I watched this movie in motion activated seats, and the cold open with Gwen ramping up the intensity on the drums was incredible. Each time she slammed the drums, the seat shook in response. The audio of her monologue and the imagery on the screen paired with the motion from the seats made for a unforgettably gripping intro. 

And that was just the first 3 minutes.",2023-06-03

"About halfway through the movie I was thinking to myself ""Huh, the pacing is kinda slow. How are they going to fit a big fight scene and ending in?""

I guess the answer is they don't. I feel like this really didn't need to be a two-parter, and not knowing before hand seeing the ""To be continued"" crawl kinda soured my experience of the movie. Which sucks, because the visuals were absolutely fantastic.",2023-06-04
"As great as Into the Spiderverse was, I went in with low expectations (it's a sequel, after all).

"Loved the movie, but a minor criticism: it felt kind of unbelievable that Miles managed to evade what appeared to be literally hundreds of Spider-People, many of whom are surely far more experienced than him, for so long, and in territory they’re all familiar with. The whole chase scene was incredibly cool and emotionally resonant, so I don’t care that much, but it felt a bit odd.",2023-06-05
I cannot be the only one that had trouble understanding what Spider-Punk was saying for a good chunk of his screen time. 🤣 Not bashing Daniel Kaluuya at all his performance was great and the movie is a 10/10 but I just couldn’t handle his heavy accent.

I loved her in the prologue but when she reappeared in the plot she lost all her charm and wlseemed like a different character.

"I feel like I'm the only one who is holding back a rating or review until this story is complete.  I guess one could argue, if this was a TV series, one would rate each episode.  But this movie didn't make an attempt at telling you this was going to be multiple movies.  I heard that in some news articles a few years ago, it was mentioned but that's a long time ago and it wasn't highly advertised.  I wish movies just put a Part 1 or Volume 1 at the beginning so we know what we're in for.  I have that feeling lied to feeling atm.

I blame Matrix Reloaded for the trend/cash grab.  I think others are saying this is like Empire Strikes Back.  I also heard Dune at least put a Part 1 in their movie.

Great movie though.  Except the ending.  Cliffhanger was a bit melodramatic for my taste.",2023-06-10

It’s pacing wasnt the best. The beginning (before miles goes through the portal) went on for so long. The chase scene >!(the one with the spider-men)!< felt like it lasted forever too.,2023-06-04
"I wish I had been warned about all the flashing lights and overly bright colors/quick image shifts.  I love Miles Morales story line, everything MCU, and Spider-Man.  But I was sick as a dog after the movie with a blistering migraine and almost vomiting.  I had to go to bed which I never do!  I don’t have epilepsy or any other disorders except I do get motion sickness.  I wish the studio had not used so many visual effects.  I could not even watch the movie hardly, just peeking at times.  Thank goodness for Reddit and videos that break down the movie so I can listen to the plot line and the things I just could not watch.",2023-06-06
"I don't know if I'm misinterpreting it, but I kind of fundamentally disagree with the core conflict of the movie.

Miguel wants to ensure that Miles' father dies, as per it being a canon event. Miguel accepts the fact that Spider-Man always loses someone close to him, and it should always happen no matter how bad it is. Otherwise the multiverse will unravel and everyone will die.

Obviously, Miles doesn't want that to happen and believes that it's possible to save both his father and the multiverse. Thus Miles attempts to do that.

And what Miles is doing is *the most Spider-Man choice* to ever be made. So I don't understand how Miguel or literally every other Spider-Man in the multiverse doesn't understand where Miles is coming from. Every single Spider-Man should try and save everyone possible, because that's what Spider-Man does. Even if that attempt is in vain, Spider-Man wouldn't care and he would try anyways.

It honestly really took me out of the movie, so can someone explain to me why my reasoning is wrong?",2023-06-07

So was I supposed to know this was a part 1.  That ending was jarring,2023-06-04
I’m just super confused how this is going to go into another two and half hour movie. They literally ended during the rising action.,2023-06-04
"I am very conflicted about this movie.

On the one hand, I agree with what most people have already said: the animation is beautiful, the jokes land, Hobie is great, etc.

On the other...

1. Gwen, Peter B, and Peni (not to mention Spectacular Spider-Man) joining up with Miguel seemed VERY out of character for them. Actually, the fact that Miguel had so many allies at all just didn't make sense to me. Miguel really has no concrete proof that him living in another universe caused that universe to collapse. I just can't see most Spider-people, who tend to be scientifically inclined, believing the theory of one guy based on one incident. That's bad science. The only Spider-people I could see allying with him are young, relatively inexperienced ones who had just been through one of the ""canon"" events where they lost a loved one, and whose grief was clouding their senses. Miguel's theory would at least make their losses mean something in their eyes.
2. I just can't believe that after everything Miles has been through with Peter B and Gwen, that they would keep so much from him and think that his father dying is the right thing, and that Gwen was willing to let her own father die. It bothered me so much that I'm seriously on the fence about whether or not that ruined their characters for me.
3. There were references that you wouldn't understand if you hadn't seen the latest live-action Marvel movies from the MCU and Sony. I know the Spiderverse movies are a celebration of Spider-Man and all his incarnations, but to me, they're also a celebration of animation and its various styles, and giving screen time to live-action characters, however brief, felt like an insult. We already got Tobey and Andrew in No Way Home; we don't need to see them here. I'm praying that they and Tom don't show up in the sequel. 
4. Why in god's name did they have Jessica Drew participate in fight scenes while she was pregnant? Does Miguel not allow maternity leave or what? Working while pregnant is one thing, but if your work is inherently dangerous, then doing so puts your baby in harm's way. I just can't believe that no one on the writing team thought that was a bad idea.",2023-06-08
"Visually it's a mess compared to the first one. Felt like every shot had 30 different things going on, it gets genuinely exhausting after a while.",2023-06-08
"Obviously the animation is beautiful, but man by the end of this it felt like I watched the first act of a movie. I couldn’t believe that was it. And did anyone else keep getting that “this is the end of the movie” feeling multiple times during the last 20 minutes? Scene that ends in swelling music, than another scene that ends in swelling music, than another scene that ends in swelling music. Jesus. Idk the first movie is masterpiece to me but this is the most incomplete part 1 I’ve ever watched. Also where the hell was supaidaman? I thought I read a while ago that he was supposed to be in this",2023-06-09

"#**A master class in story telling and animation, once again.**

How do you follow up one of the most when’re defining, character defining animated films of the last decade?

Somehow they did it. You care about the characters behind the mask, their plights, give them more depth, and elevate the personal stakes. 

Despite being a fantastical setting, everything feels personal, real, and relatable. 

Banger soundtrack, banger animation, the perfect amount of Spidey fan service. 

Goddamn. They did it again folks. 

Us Spidey fans are eating good again with the PS5 game too!

"Miles choosing to save everyone, and not choose one over the other compared to how O'Hara and the Spider-Society are subservient to that multiversal destiny is a great distinction in how he is a better superhero than the rest of them.

Miles will be able to save his dad because he’s not supposed to be spiderman which means he can write his own future. Feels a little too simple though,2023-06-02
"Fantastic movie overall. I need to see it frame by frame because there is so many fun callbacks to all Spider-Men. Starting with the obvious: 

- Spider-Man 2099 mentioning Tom Holland and Dr. Strange’s almost universe ending incursion.
- Mrs. Chen from Venom making a cameo.
- Donald Glover as the Prowler/Aaron Davis which was established in Homecoming.
- Spider-Man PS4 cameo x 3 (Ganke playing it on his PC, between the two other game ones, point meme)
- Andrew Garfield cameo to Gwen Stacey’s dad dying.
- Spectacular Spider-man telling Miles they all had to sacrifice something.
- Tobey Maguire cameo with Uncle Ben just dead in the corner. 
- Alfred Molina voice over the original Doc Ock comic design. 
- JK Simmons JJJ voice for several news reports.

And so so much more I am missing. Man these two movies do a really good job with Miles. Whatever Sony has planned for a live action movie has a really high bar to reach.

Personally I think they should just have him step into Secret Wars as a cameo but a lot of people don’t think that’ll make sense even if it is Beyond the Spider-Verse. We’ll see though!",2023-06-02

"The movie is magical script wise but what absolutely floored me was the style and choices in animation. 

Like how it just drastically changed from frame to frame within a dialogue scene. What a killer choice to just “do their own thing” and it really made the style stand out.

Each character determined what animation style was needed. 

Especially the scenes with Gwen and her father! Just wow. Absolutely love this movie.",2023-06-02

"Just came back from the cinema with the biggest smile I can have. 

What an amazing movie, full of tiny amazing details, nods to almost every single Spider-Man character created, to the MCU.

The animation is even better than the first one. I loved Gwen's universe style, like a waterpaint that changed colors.

Schwartzmann stole the movie for me as the bad guy being a goofy normal guy, turning into a Thanos level menace guy.

Can't wait for Part 2. 10/10",2023-06-02
"JK Simmons as JJJ is a nexus event confirmed!

Loved the movie, feel like I need a 2nd and maybe 3rd viewing in order to determine if I like it as much or more than the 1st one.

Started off a bit slower and more *backstory* heavy than I would've prefered, but once it got going, holy shit did it get going. Miles' escape was probably the most exhilarating scene I've seen in years.

The humor in this puts every other Marvel property to shame IMO, and this is coming from a big MCU fan. Simply elite comedic writing.",2023-06-02

"This movie broke me in a way that needed to be broken. 

I don’t know if I can speak for anyone else, but I got very attached to the first movie and the characters within them but only as they existed there. Gwen and Peter B weren’t entities, merely engines to push Miles forward, never given a hard enough spotlight to expose their flaws. It took me a good half-hour of sitting on the movie to realize the weird feeling in my gut was the same betrayal Miles felt, that two characters I love would hear Miguel talk about Miles in such a way and agree. 

And it made sense! They did it in a way that made sense! The movie’s approach to nihilism, how the inevitability of bad must also mean the embrace of bad, is perfectly reflected in the two of them. 

Man, what a needed gut punch",2023-06-02
Honestly Sony should stick to doing animated spider-man movies while Marvel studios should stick to doing live action ones,2023-06-02
"It is a nearly perfect movie. The only issue I have with it is that unlike every other movie that is split into two parts, this one doesn't feel like a movie of its own. 

It feels like it ends right after the seconds act.

Which I get it, it's a long movie with a long story. But it feels like it ends halfway through.",2023-06-02
"So I definitely remember this was announced as two-parter but I was still a bit underwhelmed by the end, mostly unresolved but still found the entire movie thoroughly engaging and fun all the way. Whole theater definitely let out a resounding “mmmmmchttt”

The opener was a great contrast to ITSV and Gwen’s world and animation are strikingly gorgeous. The layers of Easter eggs were also something else. Sony have actually done a decent job at maintaining their canon here and seeing little nods here and there at both the Venom-verse and MCU, among countless others, were very gratifying and a bit of a relief to see. The tying of the “canon moments” and seeing lines of Spider-Men from Andrew and Tobey down to Gwen and Miles. It was fan service but fan service that literally ties the story together and couldn’t be done better. The actual Donald Glover in Prowler costume! 

The new Spider people were fantastic really I couldn’t get enough of them, especially Punk and India. The implication of Miles’ bite, which in hindsight is brilliant when you look back at the spider in ITSV. All time stand out though for me is the LEGO MARVEL UNIVERSE LMAO “You’re one of our best.” literally had me crying. This movie is what Multiverse of Madness needed to be.

For all the missteps Sony have had this movie really gave me faith they have a better understanding of what fans want to see, and fingers crossed they keep this momentum with Madame Webb and Kraven. I’d love to see them take the limitations of what they can or can’t work with and extend them into the stories, i.e. if the Spider Society operates concurrent to the TVA or not, Michael Keaton’s Vulture being another anomaly in the wind, the symbiote “hive-mind” etc",2023-06-02
"I had no idea this was only part 1 and had no idea 2hrs flew by.  The pacing in this movie was incredible, was never bored and it felt so fast. I still can't believe it was 2+hrs.",2023-06-02
"Honestly better than I could've dreamed of. It was somehow even more inventive than the first movie, in all the right ways. The visuals, the emotions, the characters, it was all done so well. It was just perfect and I would've been ready to rewatch it right away if I could.",2023-06-02

Can someone tell me what Gwen asked Jessica Drew to do to her in the Vulture fight?,2023-06-02
"Just got out of the movie. I am blown away. As a lifelong spider-man fan this movie provided fan service in every way possible. But, fan service aside, just like (into the spider-verse) it was a fresh story that had godly animation, emotional arcs, themes about identity and becoming your own spider-man as well as fantastic voice acting.

When the movie was over I was in shock because I was ready to watch another two hours. When the “to be continued” came up it caught me so off guard. I CANNOT WAIT A 
YEAR. I feel like it’s hard to compare this movie to the first one because the overarching story is not over yet, but what is on pace to accomplish can and I can confidently say will be incredible.",2023-06-02
"So it looks like I’ll be in the minority here, but I thought this movie had some serious pacing issues. I keep asking myself if the movie really needed its slow first act to justify all the big big moments in the second half, and the answer I keep reaching is… no. Not after a whole first movie to build the relationships we end up seeing. 

I personally think the first half dragged a lot, it felt too slow. Making the unadvertised TBC at the end all the more infuriating. Then again, the fact that I was dying to see more means they did a damn good job.

Overall a good movie, but with frustrating pacing for what ultimately seems like a move to get more cash out of a third movie. But I did still love it.

Also I don’t understand why Miles has to have *two* awful life tragedies? Do they ever explain that? It doesn’t make sense to me for him to have an extra canon event…",2023-06-02
The animators must have really liked that Gwen ponytail look. They made every excuse to have her be upside down.,2023-06-02
"If Into the Spider-Verse was about, Anyone can wear the Mask, then Across the Spider-Verse is about what it means to dawn the mask; dare I say the responsibility of the mask. What it means to be Spider-Man. The responsibility of it all. The mantle of Spider-Man weighs Miles down. The impact of it all, is it too much? Across the Spider-Verse is a phenomenal movie. Not just a great Spider-Man movie, but overall, an Amazing movie. It asks if pain and loss is essential for one's character growth and if that's just a part of life we have to accept. Everyone is saying this and that's because it's true, but this movie blows the animation out of the water, even compared the 1st one, which is saying something! It's just jaw droppingly gorgeous and I need it to be surgically fueled into my bloodstream. Take everything out of Art Museums and replace it with screen caps of this film. This is art and Animation is Cinema. I think it's easily got the 2023 Oscar for Best Animated and should be nominated for Best Picture even. This movie is about more than Spider-Man. It's about the human experience. I love how much time we get to spend with Miles, not Spider-Man, but Miles himself. It feels like something that wouldn't happen these days. ""It's a Spider-Man movie, get on with the Spider-Maning!"" But that's just it, the character of Miles/Peter - the human side of it, is so ingrained into the character of Spider-Man. It feels very akin to Spider-Man 2 in that way. On the review end of it all, it does start a bit slow, but there's so much to set up, it's understandable. It builds on the characters you know and loved from the first movie while introducing new characters that you'll come to love. It is the perfect sequel to Into the Spider-Verse. Some might not love what this movie does - but it does what it needs to do to get us to where we need to be for Beyond the Spider-Verse. But once it starts going, it doesn't stop! The soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton is once again, spectacular. The music as well is great by Metro Booming. And if you want Easter Eggs, it's got plenty. And the big question of it all, is it the best Spider-Man movie? I really need to see it again, but dare I say yes? Across the Spider-Verse understands the character of Spider-Man and the humanity of the characters on a core level. The mortality of it. This is the quintessential Spider-Man movie. If this is the standard of quality, I am over the moon excited for the finale, Beyond the Spider-Verse. I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie and cannot wait to see it a million more times.",2023-06-02
Very good to great movie (need to watch again to catch all the jokes). Obviously very visually impressive. The story takes some twists but I’m excited for part 2. I definitely would’ve enjoyed this one more if I knew it was a part 1. Also 25 minute prologue on a long ass movie is not what’s up.,2023-06-02
I think I spoiled myself on many of the jokes just by watching the sheer amount of trailers out there. They unfortunately cut out the Mario Kart joke.,2023-06-02

"Saw it in imax yesterday and it was something else, everything about  it was amazing and the visuals where the cherry on top. 

Haven’t been interested in the live action comic book movies for years so it’s great to still have an alternative with a lot of care and a lot of heart. Also great to that Yuri Lowenthal got a speaking cameo all be it very brief.

"Loved the movie, one of the best pieces of cinema I've ever seen. The ""to be continued"" was some bullshit though. I am 100% fine with them deciding that they couldn't tell the story in one movie, but call it ""Across the Spiderverse Part 1"" or something so I know it's just gonna dead-ass stop in the absolute middle of the story. Just seems weird for a trilogy to basically be movie 1 then movie 2 parts 1 + 2. 

Still, can't complain too much as it was truly fantastic. During the massive chase scene I got a feeling of awesomeness overload that I've only ever gotten from 2 other films - Mad Max Fury Road and the first Avengers film. 

Lego Spider Man was so fucking funny too. Much preferred this cast of alternative Spiders to the first film (still hate the stupid Spider-Pig thing).",2023-06-02
"I FUCKING love this movie. All I hope (considering this trilogy has been about multiverses and all) is that we get symbiotes into the mix as well, Venom I feel is integral to Spider-man. Like for example, earth 42 has no spider man, instead it has a Prowler. What if that earths Peter finds the symbiote, and uses it to be 'spider-man'. Idk, I just want to see a little bit of venom or maybe even a carnage easter egg",2023-06-02
"The magic of this movie is being able to flesh out multiple people in this ridiculously large cast of characters. Even with his limited runtime, I’m so happy at how much they were able to get out of The Spot, and I’m thoroughly invested in seeing how that plot line plays out. Also, the focus on Gwen’s story throughout the film was a nice change of pace and felt much needed since she’s basically the secondary protagonist.

The story also has an amazing set up that is super creative, taking full advantage of this Spider-Verse premise. It’s extremely compelling, but it’s main conflict is introduced about halfway into the film, which brings me to my biggest criticism.

The only real issue I have with this movie is that it feels like a part 1. This is just not a complete movie, and despite ending on such a high note, it’s not a satisfying cliffhanger. It’s like I just pressed pause halfway through a movie so that I could continue it later. Despite this, I think it’s better than something like Dune, because I’m already invested in this world so I’m more than willing to deal with half a story for a payoff.

It helps that this movie is so well paced. I barely felt those 2 and a half hours fly by. It was filled with engaging emotional beats, great action and humor, and some of the most stunning animation I’ve ever seen. Seriously, this might be the most gorgeous movie I’ve ever seen in a theater.

I guess a minor nitpick is some of the cameos, specifically that store owner from Venom. It’s cute but reminded me of some cheap fan service from No Way Home instead of being natural additions to the film. Same with that Donald Glover cameo.

Overall, this is a great fucking movie and I love it a lot, but I do think it is weaker than the first movie, but it’s also just half a movie (mainly setup). However, if BTSV is on the level of this movie, then I think this might end up being a better film than ITSV.

There was a bit too much back and forth in the first half but the second half was great, but maybe not as a great if you're not a spider nerd. My girlfriend didn't understand most of the references and it started to grate on her a bit lol, and she's a casual spider man fan too.

For starters, I absolutely loved this movie so much. Of course, the animation is top tier. I can go on and on about this, so let me boil it down into dot points

● The whole story telling with ohara explaining to miles he was the first anomaly and with the 
42 spider. insane OMG AND THEN GOING TO THE UNIVERSE THE SPIDER WAS CREATED WITHOUT A SPIDERMAN

I didn’t see the first one and was bored yesterday so I figured i’d go see this movie. I thought it was an excellent film with beautiful animation and colors — and I see why the animators of Puss in Boots replicated it. The part where Gwen was talking to her father right before she leaves again was animated extremely well and the lines were very touching. 

Knowing what i’ve heard about the first movie I was able to piece together everything that was going on pretty quickly and enjoy the film.

EDIT: I’m reading a lot of comments on this post and i’m seeing more people had problems with the sound mixing in their theater. I was wondering about that myself because the part where Gwen was drumming at the beginning was hard to hear her lines over the drums. I’m glad I wasn’t the only one. Hopefully Sony can fix that real quick and send it back out to the theaters.",2023-06-02

I looked at the time right before the movie ended and was wondering how they were going to wrap everything up as we were well past the 2 hour mark. So pissed I have to wait for part 2 but God damn was that a fantastic movie!,2023-06-02

I thought it was the best Spiderman story ever, even more than the cartoon and movie I grew up with, with such an incredible twist to the plot.

And across the spiderverse topped the game in animation. personally I think the first movie is slightly, just ever so slightly better because the plot is more self contained, but the larger universe, with Gwen taking a bigger role is very interesting as well.

I absolutely cannot wait the next movie to come.",2023-06-02

The story was quite interesting too and the Spot is definitely one of the more interesting super-villains I've seen.

I enjoyed this even more than the first one. They really stepped up the visuals in this one.",2023-06-02
"I enjoyed the movie, but I was confused by the story. Why was Miles’ world still fine if he was an anomaly that shouldn’t exist as spider man? Miguel said that his Peter was not meant to die and the spider that bit Miles came from Earth 42, but no one asked why Miles’ universe was not affected by the glitch. Did Miguel stop it from getting worse? Did Miles fix it in the first movie by shutting down the machine? I don't remember it well. (I should go back to watch the first one again)

Also, did Miles have to become the Prowler in every universe he was in? Or did he become Prowler only because his world had no Spider-Man? Do the comics have any clues about this?

I don't know what they want to do with the story in the next part, but I think the idea of Miles being a villain by default makes it so interesting. It makes Miles Morales (Spider-Man) even more unique.",2023-06-02

"The sound of the dialogue at my theater was a little low...not sure if others had that problem. 

But anyways I think I understood Miguel's speech about the canon event. What I didn't understand is why it was necessary to let Miles' father die. Didn't Miles already have his canon event with his uncle (even though he wasn't supposed to be Spider-Man since the spider that bit him wasn't from his universe)?",2023-06-02

"super great film. I had a blast end to end, though I was a bit annoyed that it drops into a cliffhanger.

cementing this film, the mcu, and every other side story including the videogames  in to a shared multiverse was really cool.  rolling all of their shared backstory elements in to the ""canon events"" was a fun way to explain the similarities. Miles, Peter, gwen, other peter, etc. keep explaining this backstory that they all share in some form or another, it keeps happening over and over. Maybe it's time to break the cycle, maybe it's not. it makes for a compelling conflict

Every frame is made with such attention to detail and passion, it's incredible. several times I got emotional thinking about the artistic and creative love put in to this project. I was worried it would be a copy of the previous movie in terms of style, but they took it to a whole new level. Mumbattan was so fun and unique, Gwen's water color world was beautiful, lego peter is a credit to the Spider-bureau.

I kinda wished for more of the multiversal details like how ""Hammer Space"" was one of vulture's traits. It made the fight seem like a videogame fight in a really cool way. What other traits to other universes get? We see a 2d spiderman, so i guess that's one.

somehow poe dameron managed to make it through the movie without becoming a full-on villain (despite almost eating vulture for lunch). he never really crossed the line at any point. he's just very zealous.",2023-06-02
This is one of the most beautiful movies I’ve ever seen. Just the opening 10 minutes with Gwen and the Renaissance Vulture was breathtaking.,2023-06-02
"This might seem like a dumb question but...  


Did the MCU Spider-Man just cause multiple canonical disruptions by saving all those villains in NWH considering their fate was to die. Can't imagine Miguel would let a big event like that just slide. Would be very intresting if they could adress that in the sequel",2023-06-02
"Love the movie!! Just have a quick question because I’m confused and there was so much information to process on the first watch:

How did Spot know Miles’ true identity and who his dad was? I’m referring to the scene where Spot goes to the next particle collider thing and gets even more powerful and Miles had the vision of Spot attacking and killing his father. And Spot kept saying something like “now I’m gonna destroy everything and everyone you love” and Miles keeps seeing the vision of him showing up to kill his dad.

I definitely missed something because I don’t know how Spot knew that Spider-Man was Miles Morales (and thus knew which family members of Miles he could target)",2023-06-02
What's crazy to me is that this whole movie is a set up for what comes next but it doesn't feel like a set up. They did such a good job of moving all the pieces of the story forward without making it boring,2023-06-02
Great movie but the fact that's its a part 1 hurts it. Doesn't feel finished on its own. No flaws other than that,2023-06-02
When Gwen and miles start to realize that miles is in the original earth 42 spider and miles isnt on his earth was just crazy and when the scenes was cutting back and forth to their perspectives 😫😫 I love this movie,2023-06-02
"After watching the movie I only have one question in my brain

What the fuck, is that allowed?!",2023-06-02
"I think there's a very obvious set-up that Miguel is wrong about things. He has to be. Because that's what Miles is set out to prove. I don't think it was merely ""changing the canon"" that destroyed his universe, but something specific to how he did it - pulling a Rick Sanchez and taking the place of his counterpart, something akin to what we heard of in Multiverse of Madness. 

One potential issue with this is Spider-India's universe being in danger, but that might just be (at least partly) because of the Spot's presence - I'd have to rewatch the film (which I plan to) and probably wait for the sequel, too. So I'm waiting to see how things play out.

We do know (or it's heavily implied that) Gwen's dad didn't have to die; he was saved indirectly by Gwen revealing her identity and him subsequently quitting his job, and the universe seems alright. So if something like that works, there has to be some way in which Miguel is wrong - at least, that's what I think. 

Maybe it won't be exactly how I envision it; perhaps it's a broader issue than what Miguel specifically did - he does imply there have been multiple cases after all, and I doubt they were all life swaps. But I think ""you can't try to save these people, even if you know what'll happen beforehand, because their deaths have to happen"" will be flipped on its head. I don't think the answer will be what Miguel believes it is - the whole point is that Uncle Ben's death was preventable. It didn't have to happen. And the film is very much set up as a ""you have to defy what others tell you"" story - the narrative is clearly on Miles' side. 

But I also don't think it's necessarily out of character that, faced with the dilemma of letting one person die to save countless others, Peter…chooses to allow the individual to go. If there's really no other option. I think Spider-Man PS4 did this very well - of course, he set out to save everyone, but he got the cure too late, and ultimately chose to let his aunt die, which didn't strike me as out of character at all - instead, it encapsulated it. Ben Parker died because he didn't understand responsibility; May Parker died because he did. 

Given how high the stakes are, what the cost could be, and what Miguel showed of his experience...I don't think it's an unthinkable choice for their characters. Because even trying to defy that in the heat of the moment could, as far as they know, doom everyone in that universe; that's a tremendous risk, an understandable deterrent, and pretty demotivational, even to Spider-Man. But most importantly, to them, it doesn't look like there's any ""winning play"". That's the crucial bit. 

Comparing that to Green Goblin's bridge ultimatum in the first Spider-Man movie or Peter's choice to save the villains in No Way Home...while both were gambles, there was still a clear goal at the outset. But here? It looks like the options are mutually exclusive. 

But even so, I don't think Miles is the first to go against it - openly or otherwise. Others were probably just sent home forcefully or, like Spider-Punk, stayed a bit more discrete. Miles was just the first to openly defy it and actually escape. We see some who are visibly uncomfortable with it, hesitant, or on the fence - especially when listening to Miles' arguments and accusations. It's their hearts going against what their heads are telling them. 

But when it came down to it, Spider-India wanted to do both, just like Miles. And despite what Gwen says, I don't think she'd let her dad die without a fight. It's much easier to say you're with Miguel on this, but in the moment, the closer that decision is, it's much harder to follow through, especially with those close to you. Even among those trying to catch him, we see people hesitating, like the woman working the DNA teleporter. Plenty didn't, of course, but in fairness, most probably didn't even know what was happening.

And obviously, we know Gwen recruits people who switch over to help Miles, and I expect many more to follow in the future. In any case, I hope this idea is explored more in the sequel and that we see the perspectives of many more Spider-Folk. 

But again, I think it'll be revealed that the Spider-People are operating under the wrong principle; it's not one or the other, there is another way, and Miles will prove it to everyone.",2023-06-02

"I just saw it. Holy shit. This is the best superhero movie ever. Straight up. Everything about it was great. My only complaint is having to wait for nearly a year for the next one. I cannot wait. That ending was brutal. I really loved Gwen's character here, definitely the highlight imo. She was great in the first one, but here she was basically the main character. Her universe was incredible, with the pastel colors and the mood based changes. Her relationship with her dad was complex and well written. She kicks ass. She faces so much internal conflict throughout the movie. And she comes out strong by the end. Miguel was also great. I kinda feel for him, and don't entirely disagree with his points. The central conflicts in this film itself were really creative and interesting. They're complex issues where you can't really say one side is unequivocally wrong, and even the main villain is somewhat sympathetic and slowly grows to become a proper supervillain. We basically saw his origin story. The writing for the parents was another standout. There aren't many other films that nail the character relationships and dynamics this well. Miles was also good, but didn't really standout like he did in the first one. He was very well-written, and I like that the mom got more screentime here. I cannot tell how the sequel is going to go, and I wish I could skip ahead to it.",2023-06-02
I'm not sure if it was just me but did anyone else notice the sound mixing was off?

- Unreal film and a great watch.

- Definite audio mixing issues (as a soon to be graduate film student it was quite noticeable and should have had a bit more polish before release).

- Gwen was a great co-lead and her art style was beautiful.

- Loved how they gave Rio way more to do compared to ‘Into’.

- Dunno if it’s just me but I hope we get way more Peter B. Parker in ‘Beyond’ cuz Johnson is immaculate in that role and it felt like his smaller role in this film (for obvious reasons of it being Miles’ story now, the whole point of ‘into’) just lost some of the magic of the first film.",2023-06-02

"I’m really certain that it will be revealed that Miguel is wrong about what causes that dimension he lived in to fall apart. The whole canon thing doesn’t make sense to me, the idea that Spider-Man’s uncle has to die or else the entire universe falls apart is just dumb. I feel that dimension fell apart because Miguel was from a different dimension and being there too long caused some paradox to happen.

The only other example of a canon event causing a dimension to destabilise is when Miles saves the captain when he was supposed to die, but that doesn’t add up either. For one, that seemed clearly caused by The Dot, not what Miles did, and it also had immediate consequences unlike in Miguel’s situation in which it seemed to take much longer to happen.",2023-06-03

My biggest gripe is that Miguel's orgin wasn't really spoken about, which may have been intentional given how he's from a timeline where Spider-Man existed long ago, and his entire plan is counter to what Spider-Man at his core believes.

Especially if you know the comics and you see ""Ends of The Earth"" Spider-Man in his armor, that's like fresh off of his No One Dies storyline. Even if the ""canon"" events already happened to them I don't believe these Spider People would want to let someone die if they could prevent it. 

I'm happy Spectacular Spider-Man got the spotlight but at the same time he was pretty much saying, ""This innocent person has to die so many can live."" and that just doesn't go right with me. 

Aside from Gwen's team I really hope they show off Spider People who just flat out turned the guy down in thr next one.",2023-06-03

This movie however **does** feel like it requires the full attention of different spider-men, and that makes it so much better.

Also, 2099 was the best Spider-man, he stole every scene he was in and it was just because of how much of a presence he had. I know the story wants me to side with Miles, but Miguel has a very good point!",2023-06-03

"I LOVED this movie!  Gorgeous movie and Amazing Story!  I was only a bit confused about Canon Events and how they worked.  AND... lol Yeah probably Reading WAY too much into this.  Just Curious.  Maybe they will explain Canon Events better in the next one.  But, why did they go to Spider-Man India's Reality?  Yeah, The Spot is there... But with Miles they know way ahead of time a Canon Event is coming for Miles... Shouldn't they also already know this for Pavitr Prabhakar?  So risking stopping Canon Event would be way to risky even for going to after The Spot I would think.  (Though counter theory: Spot is creating New Canon Events that can't be predicted).   While, if I remember correctly, we are not out right told why Miles wasn't invited to the Spider-Society, I assumed because they knew the entire time a Canon Event was coming for him right?  I thought maybe it is because he is an Anomaly, but that should result in the Society going to him ASAP I would think.  So if it is because of the Canon Event, if they know all this stuff already, shouldn't they have not invited Spider-Man India?  And then this begs the question how many Canon events happens to a Spider-Person?  Because Miles was shown to already have one with Uncle Aaron, it would seem interacting with any other realities Spider-Person would be way too dangerous.  And lastly what I hope we could get more about:  Who's Canon Event did Miguel interfere with?  We saw what he did, just not to who's Canon Event (that 2099 Spidey was already dead).  Whoever his replacement was going to be... but yeah probably will never see that person",2023-06-03

"After seeing it again, one of the things that I personally love about the film is how it revealed so much, and yet so little. 

By the time they enter the lobby and you really start learning about the Spider-man multiverse concept, there are only 50 minutes left in the movie. It moves at such a breakneck pace that you don't even notice the runtime. When movies have me wishing they were longer, that's how I know it was a good film.",2023-06-03
Yall need to see this in IMAX laser screen. oh boy what a ride! Beautiful!,2023-06-03
When I saw the first trailer for the first film I thought oh that actually seems good. I had no idea it would ascend to this level of film making and animation and screenwriting,2023-06-03
"Theory: I came across a tweet (I will link it) pointing out two colors during Miles’s senses going from Green and Purple to Red and Blue, indicating that he was supposed to be Prowler all along, but he was influenced to become Spider-Man. 

It’s revealed in the film that Miles was a mistake, and that he wasn’t supposed to become Spider-Man. The end of the film shows another universe where Miles IS the Prowler. So could that mean it was a butterfly effect when the Miles we know ended up becoming Spider-Man, then the other one ended up becoming Prowler? I feel like that could be a reason why the evil Miles may want something to do with him. Just a theory!

I also think 20 mins somehow someway should've been cut. Definitely feel like it ran long. 

I loved the ""twist"" although I kind of saw it coming from the moment he got into his room. Also... This further affirms my assumption that ant man did not end up in his dimension after the quantumania conclusion. 

Also.... Loved the reverse gwen/peter death. Amazing bit of shadowing and animation to show him in a tattered spidey costume while she held him in her arms.",2023-06-04

"Very enjoyable film like the last one. I only had two gripes. One, I wasn't expecting there to be such a large cliff-hanger at the end of the film. Two, in a city of Spiderfolk, even one upholding multiversal law, I find it very surprising that more didn't defend/support Miles. I guess it was kind of a multiverse sized trolley problem, but i think more of the Spider-Men (Women, etc.) would of advocated for trying to save everyone. Other than that, the movie was a blast!",2023-06-04

"Finally got to see it tonight, and just wow. My instant gut reaction, is this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The humor hit, the emotions hit, the music hit, and the animation is easily the best looking I can remember. I easily could have sat through 5 hours of this, every voice actor nailed their roles...",2023-06-04
"Love this small detail during the credits.

During the sequence where Miles is trying to save his falling dad, Miguel/2099 is shown to be chasing him. Then suddenly in few short bursts, they change his color schemes to green and purple.

I love how it subconsciously reminds you of the Green goblin. How it implies that 2099 could be the ""green goblin"" to miles' gwen stacy, his dad. Small details like these make this movie even better!",2023-06-04

"This Movie definitely winning best animated movie of the year! It has so many Easter Egg that you'll have to watch it a second time to find them all. At least this movie has a better cliffhanger than a certain other movie cough cough ""Fast X""",2023-06-04
Really enjoyed this movie. The animation was phenomenal. It had a lot of heart and I loved the characters. Indian Spider Man was a hoot! Maybe a touch too long in runtime and I could tell this would end in a cliffhanger as there was way too much to be resolved by the 2 hour mark. Can't wait until the next one!,2023-06-04
"Saw it for the second time. 

My only lingering question is why isn't Spot glitching out like other villains who have gone across dimensions. Vulture earlier showed that they have the same glitch out as Spidermen without the wristwatches. Why is Spot seemingly the exception?",2023-06-04
That was the most beautifully animated movie I have ever seen.,2023-06-04
I don’t care for MCU at all but gave this a shot tonight. Best experience I’ve had in a theater in a while. The colors…. The details….. it feels like the product of spending an entire lifetime on little details especially considering the movie is 2 hours long,2023-06-04
This movie sounded and looked ridiculously good. It was distractingly stunning at points.,2023-06-04
"This movie was phenomenal. Looks great, the story and writing I think are good. Succeeds the 1st movie IMO. Also I wasn’t aware they stopped marketing this movie as 2 parts didn’t know many would be surprised by the ending.

"Fantastic movie. The visuals and art style were literally jaw dropping. I was in awe the entire time. The soundtrack and style was amazing too. 

The only critique i had is that the ending really slowed down the pacing. I knew there was a cliffhanger and I kept waiting for it to end….and it kept going. Don’t get me wrong I loved the reveals and twists at the end, but the pacing in the last 15 minutes was surprisingly sluggish compared to the breakneck speed of the rest of the movie. In any case can’t wait for part 2!",2023-06-04
I never would have imagined a bagel could foreshadow a multi-dimensional conflict,2023-06-04
"Watched this movie last night and fucking LOVED IT! I’m not a huge comic book person or anything, I mostly just watch the marvel movies, but I’ve loved the first spiderverse movie since I saw it when it came out, especially Gwen. I finally cosplayed her last year and of course wore my suit to the theater. I actually started reading her comics but realized it just wasn’t keeping my interest so I returned it to the library but luckily I had read far enough that the story with her dad and all that was familiar to me in this movie. I’m so happy we got more backstory on Gwen and just way more characterization this time around. She’s seriously my favorite. 

What else can be said that hasn’t already been said? The movie is gorgeous. The comic book art style is just as great as the first movie, but the melding of art styles between the different Spider-Man’s and universes was even better! All the new characters were amazing, and I got so excited to see the old crew come back just to get hit with the “to be continued.” It just shows how engaging this story is that I hadn’t even noticed we were at the end of the movie. I will say the dialogue is SO quick that I feel like I need to go back to catch everything. And there are stretches of the movie where it feels like nonstop action for 30 minutes. But overall just SO good.


My only issue with it is the plot kinda reminds me of Loki, which I hated. The TVA spends the whole show saying the timelines need to be put “right” to the way they were before and I never understood who got to make that call. Who says the story “has” to be that way? In this movie it’s Miguel saying these events, Uncle Ben dying or the police captain dying, are “canon” events that have to happen, but he never explains who gets to decide that or even how he determined it’s required, he just said he tried to replace a different version of him and he destroyed the universe. I have faith the conclusion will follow Miles’ line of thinking that he can “do both.” But I’m not sure if that means it will negate the entire concept of canon events to get there or if something will change in the story to get there such as how Gwen’s dad got “safe” by quitting his job, or maybe some technicality that will allow captain Morales to live. 

Which leads me to my questions about Earth 42. If Miles 42 is Prowler does that mean Uncle Aaron was meant to be this universe’s Spider-Man? That would be so cool. 

But also, I was thinking. If Miles wasn’t supposed to be Spider-Man at all and Peter Parker only died because the spider got in from the wrong universe through the collider, doesn’t that mean Captain Morales ISN’T supposed to die? Didn’t all the other captains have some connection to the Spider-Man in their universe? But until Miles was bit, he had nothing to do with the Peter Parker in his world…idk I’m just spitballing here. 

Anyway amazing film, can’t wait to see it again. My theater (NYC) was packed and very vocal throughout. As someone who only got into the MCU and Marvel post Endgame, this was my first theatrical experience that was anything close to what people described Infinity War and Endgame in theaters (also didn’t see NHW in theaters because I wasn’t caught up by then but I regret it cuz it looked sooo fun!) Lots of exclamations and loud laughter.",2023-06-04
"Better than the first by MILES.
Insane experience.",2023-06-04
That ending was everything. Jesus what a movie. Cannot wait for Beyond.,2023-06-04
"One thing I love about the movie is that despite the multiversal stakes where entire dimensions are threatened with destruction, it's very much a PERSONAL story for Miles and Gwen. I'm sure the next film will more focus on the actual threat of the Spot and/or whether Miguel's paranoia is justified or not, but the finale of this one is focused on Gwen's relationship with her dad and Miles encountering the dark image of what he could have become if not for the people in his life (his dad, Peter, etc.)",2023-06-04

"The 3rd movie is going to be WILD!!! Spot, Miguel, and Prowler Miles as the 3 main bad guys. I'm bummed about the cliff Hanger but such a great way to set up the final in the trilogy.

Love to see the growth of Miles and him not just going with the status-quo",2023-06-04
"I think we all are being to harsh on Miguel, because let's remember the things he has been through in a relatively short time, besides his own traumas and destroying that universe:

* The events of Intro the Spiderverse.

* The Scarlet Witch got her hands on the Darkholm and learned to dreamwalk, which seems to be just as dangerous and destructive as trying to physically take the place of your counterpart.

* Sylvie killed the One Who Remains.

* The events of No Way Home.

* And now around a year later from Intro, there are the events of this movie.

Not having a break, or at least a decent amount of sleep, is getting to him.",2023-06-04
"To me, objectively, the movie is a 10/10. They stepped up their game in the visual department, the acting's good, the story's good, the sound and score are good, it's all good really.

But I have one pet peeve with this movie that makes me, subjectively, torn between giving it a 9 or 8.5, and that is Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099.

This is my favorite alternate version of Spider-Man. I like his story, his setting, his look, he's just cool. And when I saw him teased at the end of the Into the Spider-Verse I was absolutely HYPED to see my favorite alternate spidey make his big screen debut. And what I got is what I can only describe as a Miguel O'Hara in name and looks only. He is no stranger to aggression, sure, but never have I seen, nor do I recall seeing him being this grim and aggressive.

Before you come in with ""bUt iN THe MovIe"" shut it I know, I watched it too, I understood the plot, I understood it all. My point is this: it's okay to take creative liberties with an adaptation in order to enhance and tell your story. Miles is an excellent example of this in the previous movie as his origin is very different from his comic book one, yet manages to still hit the same story beats as the original, even enhancing them too. But you also have to watch out as to not change a character so much when doing an adaptation in order to make them fit a certain role, which is what they did with 2099.

Him taking drugs (which is counter to what his origin is as he became a Spider-Man due to the fact that he was trying to get rid of a drug addiction that was imposed on him), him being so malicious towards Miles, saying he's a mistake, that he is an anomaly, that he doesn't deserve to be Spider-Man... I'm sorry but this is not the character I love. I was so excited to see him on the big screen, and what I got was... this?

Will he melow out in the next movie? Maybe. Will I be there to watch it next year? Yeah. But I'm still saddened because of this. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but this hit me deep.",2023-06-04
"This a 10/10 and I didn't they could but it's improved on the 1st and probably better than any other Spider-Man movie or Marvel IMO. The only scnee that could've been better was the San Francisco with the Chinese lady, I didn't know what was going on and I don't think anyone else did either.

Honestly can't wait to watch again, needed to sit forward and try to absorb all the different Spider-Man and Women when they all showed up. 

But, again IMO, the coolest one was Malala Windsor, if only for her namesake, thought it was a really nice Easter egg, I'm also assuming she was created for the movie.

Visually amazing, Gwens opening was just somethign else. The art style and direction were phenomenal and the action/comedy was always on point. Not many sequels are this good and Beyond is going to have to be something special. 

Was also really hoping for Tobey, Tom or Andrew to have a proper cameo. But we got to see a few of their scenes and Glover which was a surprise.",2023-06-04

Some of the monologues had me looking at my watch. I don't know. Like I said, I feel really weird about my experience. Perhaps it was overyhyped so I went in with too many expectations.",2023-06-04

Spot is an anomaly because he's in the wrong dimension and can disrupt the canon. However, now he's contributing to the canon because he's supposed to be the person to kill Miles' dad. The response I've gotten so far is that this doesn't matter because Miles' dad is going to die anyway. This implies that you *can* change the canon as long as you only change smaller details and the end result is unchanged, right? Was this rule established or is this just an assumption? Also, Gwen's dad is still going to die even though he retired?",2023-06-05

"After Spot goes into the collider and gets fully powered-up, he gains a kind of textured painting effect that reminded me of Loving Vincent.

Does anyone know if they actually achieved that effect the same way they did on Loving Vincent - by physically oil painting each frame? (Obviously they would have then had to composite it into the CG shots, but I'm wondering if there was there an initial painting stage that they did physically?)

As for the other art and animation styles used in the movie:

Between Renaissance Vulture and Spider-Punk, paper cut outs were the flashiest new animation gimmick. But I do feel like by giving us that Vulture scene so early, the film gave us its best visual idea right at the start of the film. This meant that when Hobie Brown turned up, he seemed like a variation on the same effect, rather than something completely new.",2023-06-05

"I just wanted to riff on some theories on how some things work out in the 3rd film (strap in):

I think the Spider-Verse falling apart, like in Mumbattan, is directly related to other Spider-people being involved while preventing canon events. I think Miguel lost his family in his home world and found the alternate version of himself with a family, where he went and killed himself. This obviously messed heavily with canon - one Spider-Man killing another. Meaning Miguel is the original anomaly

This would explain while Mumbattan falls apart, but not Earth-42. Getting bitten by a spider is a canon event and with Miles 42 not getting bitten because of a one in a million chance that his spider would be transported to another universe, he and his world survived. Unfortunately this meant that his destiny changed hence his transformation into The Prowler, a role that “in canon” falls to his Uncle Aaron. Everyone’s destiny changes

So Miles can save his father by himself, but that might mean that his mother or someone else has to die in exchange. Who knows?

As for Gwen, this would mean Miles would probably to her go, maybe in a pivotal scene where she she wants to give her life because that’s what destined to happen (“in every universe it doesn’t end well”)

This is where it gets hairy because Miles would then have to fight the Spot alone and I’m not sure how that happens. I’m not a writer

I spent most of this 3rd viewing thinking about this stuff. Who knows if any of it’s true but just wanted to riff on it",2023-06-12
"I barely found my doppelganger online before I watched this. He really looks like me just from different country. I said ""Hello"" & he welcomed me warmly. But then idk what to say, after 1 day then I found out he has cut our contact. I'm quite disappointed, it's like me from another universe don't want to keep contact with me. We only said Hello to each other.",2023-06-12
Movie was great but the sound mixing was awful. I thought I saw that they fixed it this weekend so wasn’t it expecting it to be that bad. I could barley hear Gwen’s intro over the drums. And a couple other scenes were hard to hear. Like the first one better still but I think the third will be the best and this one will be better to me after I see the third similar to how watching all three of the LOTR movies made each one better since it was one whole story.,2023-06-12
i have a question…okay so if miles isn’t supposed to be spider man and ISNT SPIDER MAN (as Miguel said) then why does it matter if his dad dies? because it’s not a canon event for miles??? he isn’t an actual spider-man… PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN IM SO CONFUSED??? like if IT IS a canon event then that means he’s SUPPOSED to be spider man but they kept saying he isn’t…,2023-06-12

"Just watched this a second time as one wasn't enough.

Firstly, I noticed Prowler Miles is an amputee, missing his right hand. I hope they dive a bit more into 42's backstory, was it normal until the spider was yoinked, or was it a hard left turn? Going from the end credits where they showed a younger version of miles being mirrored into both versions of miles gives me hope they'll pull a redemption story for the 42 universe.

Another, the opening scene of Gwen may be an intentional anachronism. In it she is wrestling with not being able to tell miles about the others. On the first viewing I thought it was just her coping with being forced back to her universe. But on the second viewing I noticed she is referencing what Miguel has told her about destiny. While the timing of the scene seems like it happens before being recruited, perhaps it happened while she was couch surfing, maybe joining the band via Hobie? From the sound of her talk with her dad, she quit bands regularly, so the band quitting she refers to is another one.",2023-06-13

"I am totally in love with this movie!

- Miguel considers Miles the ""original anomaly"", but that's not true. Miles comes from a universe where they would otherwise be no Spider-man. The Alchemax 42 spider ended up in his universe because of (pre)Spot's actions, and similarly, because of Kingpin's decisions.

- Miles wasn't responsible for the spider escaping it's original universe, Kingpin was. The collider would never have been made if Kingpin hadn't built it in the first place *trying to disrupt a canon event*. Kingpin becoming a criminal happens, his wife and son learn of it and get themselves killed fleeing from him in sheer terror. Kingpin then uses his vast wealth and resources to make the collider, because he's learned he can find his wife and son in another universe and go there/bring them here (I can't actually recall which one he specifically wanted to do).

- How does Mumbattan have a canon event caused by Spot that is somehow still a canon event? *Spot* causes the building to collapse, which imperils Captain Singh. The canon event here is that Singh is supposed to be crushed saving a child, but Miles stops it from happening, and Lyla informs Gwen that the ""Canon Event has been disrupted"". Spot can't both cause a canon event and also not be canon himself, ergo, Miles is also canon, despite what Miguel seems to think.

- Miles was *supposed* to be bitten by the Alchemax 42 spider and become his world's Spider-man, because if he didn't, then *other* actual canon events couldn't be canon. If Miles never becomes bitten, then Spot never happens, and then the canon event wouldn't happen. I'm not entirely sure how Miguel doesn't see this.

- We even *see* during the ""Uncle Bens"" scene, as all the Spiders are with their version of ""Uncle Ben"", the final one we see is Miles with Aaron. THAT IS A CANON EVENT. **If *that* is a canon event, how can Miles be an anomaly?**

- Are they foreshadowing Gwen's death? Not only do they cheekily re-enact her falling (only to be saved by Pavitir at the last second), but at some point, Miguel has explained/shown Gwen that ""most Gwens die"" if they fall in love with Spider-man. The way she says this tells me that Miguel might've shown her this in an attempt to ""scare her straight"" as it were, away from Miles. This is sneaky of Miguel and more than a bit manipulative if true, but considering how he feels about Miles, it could make some sense.

- Alternatively, does Miguel know/believe that Gwen *will* die and is this partially why he is so reluctant to let her join Spider-Society? Is he afraid people will get attached to her?

- Miguel might've caused the collapse of his alternate self's universe but not in the way he thinks, and he's likely totally misunderstood canon events entirely. I think he has the overall beats right for sure, and we see actual evidence of this too--but that doesn't mean Miguel is getting everything right about them, either. I firmly believe at this point that some canon *isn't* really canon but might seem like it. Who or what is determining what ""canon events"" are? Lyla? Someone else? Are they 100% without flaw or fault in their deductions of what is or isn't canon?

- This movie ties in so beautifully with the first one and we're getting so many callbacks to remind us of things in *Into the Spider-Verse* and even being shown scenes from it again in this one, so it's clearly all very important. 

Basically all of this is to say: I think most of this stuff will get explained in *Beyond* but it's really fun to think about how this will all tie up. I've never read the comics these are based on or anything.",2023-07-08
I really liked it probably more than the first one all though I did love the design of film noir spider man in the first one .,2023-07-08

Those that say Miguel is a villain should really rewatch the first 20mins of the movie and how he helped Gwen when she was at her lowest,2023-07-10
"Question about the whole canon event stuff: 

Can't Miles technically save his father, since its ""HIS"" universe that he's in? 

He saved someone else from someone else's universe, and that caused issues. 

Miguel Saved someone from an alternate universe resulting in issues.

If Miles (in his own universe) saves his father, then he should be fine, ofc the only argument is that none of it would've happened/he wouldn't be able to save his father if he wasn't spiderman, or the bite didn't happen, but then if that's the case, then anything abnormal to happen as the result of him becoming spiderman should've triggered something. with the character of Spiderman, any of them are technically brain-smart as fuck, so how come no one has figured this out???

One argument I can see working is that there exists a possibility that he would be able to save his father without finding out the exact way, and date his father would die from some outside-his-universe information, but the information alone could be what causes his universe to be destroyed if he saves him VS saving him without that information which wouldn't technically disrupt anything.",2023-07-11
"let's understand what happened, because a lot got thrown at me in this movie and I don't understand parts.

there are two universes where miles morales and his family exist.  in one universe, miles is meant to be spider man. in the other universe, blond peter parker is meant to be spiderman (and is spiderman).  but the radioactive spider was sent to blond peter parker's universe and turned the wrong miles into spiderman.  I remember the blond peter parker dying in the first movie, so now there is only miles morales spiderman in that universe.



each spider man universe adheres to mandatory canon events, or else it can't exist any more. so I feel like neither of these universes should be able to exist, because they've already messed stuff up. but for some reason they continue to exist, and in one of them, Miles goes on to be spider man while in the other one, spider man doesn't exist at all. isn't the fact that these universes continued ot exist proof that canon events can be disrupted without destroying the universe????   in any case I don't get why that universe's miles became a villain. he was supposed to become spider man. but for some reason miles inexplicably turns into an evil guy named prowler? wtf? maybe this is just because it's been 5 years since the first movie and I don't even know/remember why uncle aaron became the prowler.



why was the spider sent to another universe in the first place??? i think it has something to do with spot, the villain, who asserted that he ""made spiderman,"" but what exactly is the explanation? miles threw a bagel at him in the first movie, but he was already spiderman at that point, so IDK what that has to do with spot.",2023-07-12
"Rewatched the film and thought it was hilarious when Rio is absolutely against Princeton and Miles is like ""*New Jersey* is too far from *New York*???"" which, yeah Miles you're right NJ not that far, but Princeton is a rather long drive from Brooklyn LOL",2023-07-13
I can't explain it but miguel o'hara would hate CRT,2023-07-15

Overall loved it but I did have some issue with the pacing and ending. Considering how long it might be til we get the sequel I wish it had a more solid ending. Like it feels like it's building to the climax then it just ends. Very unsatisfying. I think the way they chose to split it also lead to some pacing issues after the intro until we get to the meat. It feels like they basically made a 4 hour movie that they just cut it into 2 rather Beyond the Spiderverse being a true sequel.,2023-08-07

"Not a frequent on Reddit but lately ive been so glad that ive been able to find a community for literally anything and everything, to an extent where the very first default reaction i had was to look up the subreddit for this movie as soon as the credits rolled and i couldn’t agree more that this was among the best animated movies ive seen all year, heck it actually takes movie of the year award for me, last year it was “everything everywhere all at once”, I’m basically a sucker for unexpected heartfelt genuine plots and this one takes the cake, I mean nothing was cheesy it was all well written/scripted, tremendously animated (a treat for adhd peeps) and plot twists got me on the edge throughout. Can’t wait for the trilogy finale (dunno if it is the finale as I’m sure they’ll milk the concept further but happy to drink that koolaid).

"I do think Miguel is a hypocrite. I mean, even if he's right, and Mile's dad's death is a canon event that no one can stop... but thats for Miles to decide. Even if miles was wrong helping pav (which is actually likely due to the spot), what happens in his universe is his job to fail or succeed at. By imprisoning Miles, the spiders are directly interfering with his universe, which they should allegedly be against.",2023-11-06

"I personally hated the art style. I hope they just go back to just drawing the backgrounds versus making it look like a child colored it in. I think they really dropped the ball when they introduced Miguel, he should have just smoked the vulture, rather than him need gwen and another spider woman. Doesn't really establish him as a BA, I mean, I know he is a male and media has a real issue establishing any male character as a BA. That's a job only for female characters now. I also think they spent alot of the movie embarrassing Miles. That being said that end twist was Sick! I loved the ""Canon"" premise. Spot was dope! I hope the next one is better.",2024-01-13
"I thought the movie was great, but not quite as great as the first one.

I also loved the implication that >!Evil Miles would've become Spider-Man had the spider not been transported to Good Miles's universe!<.",2023-06-03
"I guess I'm ADD or whatever because I didn't have any trouble keeping up with the fast paced animation. The story made little sense though. Miguel is basically Spider Thanos and all the other spidermen instantly back him up? I don't think so. They're trying to shoehorn in Infinity War where it isn't necessary. How about making Spot the sole threat? He's more than enough to justify multiverse collapse.

Also the final twist really undermines the point that you choose your own fate. Apparently the only thing separating hero Miles from villain Miles is whether or not his uncle or father dies first.",2023-06-06

"Cool movie all in all but I just wish it was a little more concise and finished the plot in 1 film. Or if that's really not possible, end it in a way similar to Infinity war where there's a conclusion (the heroes lose) even if there's clearly a part 2.

What I loved the most about the first film was that it simply tried to be a great film.",2023-06-03
"I personally still love the movie, (9/10) but I'm surprised that so many people are saying it's better than the first. I think there's clear things it did worse and it did better.

I think the parental relationship, animation and the dialogue during the slow scenes is much better, as is the villain. However, I think the one-liner quips is way more annoying and the humor is worse if at best on par with the first one. 

I think the pacing is worse too, I feel many scenes could've been shortened or cut and you actually could've had a final act instead of a cliffhanger by chopping off some scenes and making it 20 minute longer or something. I would've liked to see added scenes (like maybe Miles actually having a reaction to seeing his friends again) instead of seeing others.

Overall, I feel the movie has less emotion than the first one does. Uncle Aaron dying in Into The Spiderverse actually got something out of me, but I don't feel any very emotional scenes in this movie. I think the Gwen plotline with her dad is adequate, but it's no where near an emotional kick that the first one gives with Prowlers death. And though it may just be because the movie hasn't lasted in my memory enough, I think scenes overall are less impactful and memorable. You don't have a scene like Miles jumping off the building in the first one. I think the ending is also a poor thing, I'm surprised that I don't see more people take issue with it as I think the ending is very akin to Dune: Part One which many people had issues with.  (Dune does still have a worse ending though).

It may sound like I hate the movie, but it's still a great movie but I'm very surprised at the amount of people saying it's better than the first. I think it's a combination of a bit of recency bias and people not seeing the first in a while.",2023-06-03

Also the dialogue moved wayyy to fast, at least for me, I could barely even process what they said. I wish they would let the dialogue marinate for a bit.

"What I appreciated the most in this movie--especially with recent events in the comics-- is Miles' standing against the premise that Spider-man is defined by his suffering; which seems to be the direction that we're being pulled towards. 

Miguel and his all the Spider-people he recruits are connected by not just the web of life but their own shared trauma, Miles spits in the face of all that simply by existing because he hasn't (in their eyes) crossed that canon-event to inherit the Spider-man mantle. They're so fixated by this that they're failing to grasp the very crux of what makes Spider-man: responsibility. The responsibility to do what is right when you can--which is what Miles does at every crucial point in the movie. He tries to save Captain Singh, wants to save his father, because what do you do with great power? The multiversal Spiders *know* what will happen in each universe, and they have the power to stop it, but they're now taking a look at things from a ""greater good"" perspective, instead of what makes Spider-man truly a hero. 

The only real Spider-man in this movie, was Miles.

Omg I just realized sth crazy. The Avatar girl (who used the VR headset) was in Gwen’s crew at the end so Gwen must have thought she’s on their side. But wasn’t the reason she let Miles go was because she knew the machine would take him to the wrong universe ? Maybe that would be the plot twist in the next part ?

"I didn't catch this the first time around but Miguel intervened in Gwen's canon event when they first met. Just before Vulture flies out of the museum, he says that a canon event is coming.",2023-06-10
"For some reason, and maybe it's on porpoise, the discussion about who is right or wrong is too focus in Miles VS Miguel dilemma. But I think the movie plays us a little bit, in a good way, don’t get me wrong, with the idea of responsibility. Which is the central core of Spiderman as a character.

And in that scenario we need to talk about Gwen.

First of all, she struggles with his own reality / world. With her father, with her identity, with the people around her, and all because of her trauma; she blames herself because of the Peter Parker\`s dead of her universe. Even when she says the opposite, deep down it’s pretty clear that she doesn’t accept the fact that it was not fault, it was a tragedy. And in someway, scaping her universe (and from her own situation), going to the Spider Society and being with Miles, besides the feelings she has about him, is a way to scape from her trauma and own matters. She is unable to confront the pain, accepts the past and to carry on, instead she is constantly lying and acting irresponsibly.

First she uses the Spider Society and the Spider Woman’s trust to see Miles, instead of focusing the real threat and her original mission: The Spot. One of the anomalies that Kingpin’s collider created in the first movie, and ironically for being selfish too, Kingpin didn’t care about the consequences of playing God with the machine, the only one thing he cared about was meeting again with his family, even if they were not from his reality. Just like Miguel did.

Instead of focusing in her mission, to track the Spot for the Spider Society, she is messing around with Miles; something Miguel and Spider Woman told her NOT to do, because Earth-1610 is indeed altered. So at the end she is focusing in something important for her but not important for the others, even if she is not fully aware, once again responsibility issue here.

This situation goes on with Gwen lying to Spider Woman about how The Spot situation is getting out of control, because once again, she is not able to take full responsibility on her actions, at the point, because of her constant oversights and exposure, that Pavitr’s universe gets involved too. Creating a overpower Spot in the process.

In fact I think Miguel’s himself is not fully understanding the “canon”. Maybe it’s not about the trauma, or the tragic movie every Spiderman has to overcome, is about what leads to that moment and how that makes the individual understand the real value of responsibility or duty.

To me this is perfectly portrait in Marvel’s Spiderman videogame. When Peter DESIRES to save his aunt but he knows he can’t, even in range and crying.

I hope the next and final movie will explore this idea in the right direction. The consequences of the lack of responsibility and selfishness, like the trigger of the real hero.

I wouldn’t like to see a happy Disney ending, because Miles is somekind of genius and solves everything with the power of friendship and love. This saga doesn’t deserve that.",2023-06-16
"I didn't understand why Miles ending up in the wrong universe was supposed to be a twist. It was telegraphed multiple times with Spot talking about the spider, and we saw the scanner come up with Earth-42 when it scanned Miles!

When Miles first got on the machine, for a second I thought he was going to Earth-42 on purpose, since it's a world without a Spider-Man.",2023-06-18
Best movie in a while. Enough said,2023-06-18
"- That was good. A little long though.
- I didn't expect that ending for his to go to the wrong universe.
- Seeing Donald Glover/Childish Gambino was cool. I liked that reference.
- Ganke playing Insomnia Spider Man was hilarious. No one in the theater noticed it.
- Still loving the art style as well. Would honestly like a TV show or videogame in this art style.
- Really like the soundtrack as well. Not the rap music but the actual music score soundtrack.
- I hope the 3rd film is still slated for next year and not moved to 2025+",2023-06-18

"For me I was going into this expecting the Scarlet Spider to have a decent part but they made him a dumb comic relief character. They could have utilised his back story for depth giving these canon events he could have been a juxtaposition with a unique, alternate viewpoint given his tragic story. Surely the clone saga would’ve been a canon event or an anomaly so 2099 could’ve had beef with that. I wanted Ben to get some justice after recent comic runs like chasm but it was wishful thinking. It’s such a shame because his design was so clean and the art style was nailed it’s so sad that this was all for nothing. 

I enjoyed the cameos, there were several to enjoy my favourite was Spectacular Spider-Man that made me hope we could get Christopher Daniel Barnes Spidey in the next movie.  

As another commenter said on another thread the characterisation of Miguel felt more apt for someone like Superior Spidey. Also the characterisation of every other Spidey that you know and love who was featured in the movie who agreed with Miguel’s faction was character assassinated as this is something I don’t think any Spidey would get behind especially the way it’s being done.  

My absolute favourite thing about the movie was the art style for Gwen’s world it’s straight from the Spidergwen comics with the colourisation and the watercolours. I also liked her suit update and Miles suit looked sleek too. The way they also incorporated some comic panels, movie events and video game scenes in the explanation of canon events was so cool too. 

Hobie Spidey was a good addition and a fun character with a few good one liners. Pavitr from what we seen of him was pretty cool and I enjoyed the scenes in his universe. 

Overall I think the plot could’ve been worked on and would’ve preferred something like the comics Spiderverse storyline with all the Spiders working together to defeat a threat instead of putting a couple of Spidey’s down to raise up Miles and Gwen up. I felt we spent too long with Miles and his parents too. The scene at the party was a bit boring I felt we accomplished everything we needed to understand about the dynamic at the school meeting and when Miles Spidey talks to his Father after chasing the Spot.",2023-06-02
"This was the best movie I HAVE EVER SEEN. The first one used to be that, but this one somehow tops it in every way. I love the emotions throughout the movie. ITSV focused more on becoming Spider-Man and learning how to be one, whereas this one emphasized all the problems that come with being Spider-Man and the loneliness that Miles and Gwen go through. They're honestly some of, if not the only characters that I sympathize that much with. Their lives are hard and not really fun. Seeing each other is the only thing that keeps them going, but they know (especially Gwen) they can't do that. They have to keep their distance from one another. The music vid for 'calling' only makes it so much worse. EVERY LINE in that song talks about their situation. It's been almost a week since I've seen the movie and I still can't get over it. It honestly hurts and I'm not even the most sympathetic person out there. 

&#x200B;

I haven't even gotten to the visuals, album, villains, rest of the plot. But just seeing both Miles and Gwen going through it like that makes this movie a 10/10. The colors in Gwen's world really showed her pain and seeing her problems with her dad made it so painful.

This felt more like Dune, where there is clearly more that was shot and we just had no choice but to end it here.",2023-06-04

"I loved the animation, and I liked the story, but I didn't like the whole ""gang up on Miles"" bit of it all. Even when we found out that Daddy Peter and Gwen, who are supposed to be his friends, were part of the set up...if I were Miles, that would have been it for me - betrayal speaks louder than anything. 

That being said, it would have been much more satisfying if they actually explained how Miles was the original anomaly. Sure, he wasn't supposed to be bit, and had he not been, his Peter Parker would have been alive...but how did the anomaly occur? Who let it happen? The entire movie, from Miguel's perspective, appears to have been centered around the idea that Spidermen needed to come together prevent Spidermen from generating more anomalies...well then how did the first one occur and who was responsible for it? If it weren't another Spiderman who was responsible for it, then his entire rhetoric of how Spidermen need to sacrifice to keep thing in check falls apart. Without an explanation to this, the entire philosophy that ""this should never have happened"" is invalid, and it simply makes Miguel an idiot. I hope the creative team doesn't get lazy about this and tells a satisfactory story about this.

Overall, great movie, and I'm glad I saw it. I can't wait for the next, and perhaps they will explain in the next one, but anyone else think something similar?",2023-06-07
"Was the entire ""Captain Stacy dies"" canon-event a major plot point in the Spider-man mythos prior to this movie? Like, yes, it happened but I've never heard it put on par with Uncle Ben's death (or Gwen Stacy's) as a pivotal moment.

I admittedly only know about Spider-man through the '94 cartoon, movies, games, and general pop cultural osmosis but considering 2/3 of the live-action movies don't even foreground Gwen Stacy...

It seems like a strawman premise. I find it hard to believe that variations as diverse as Spider-Punk, 2099, Silk, Spider-woman, etc. can all have their character arc boiled down to: a) an uncle Ben equivalent dies and b) Police captain dies without being guilty of the broadest generalization.

Even if I'm wrong and Jessica Drew, Miguel O'Hara, Gwen Stacy, etc. are fundamentally just Peter Parkers by different names, wouldn't a much cleaner way to show that ""Spider-man doesn't need to be defined by trauma"" be to simply show a Spider-man not being defined by trauma?

Getting bogged down with  the characters speaking the meta-narrative is ceding ground to the obsessive, gatekeeping nerds it's criticizing by even stopping to acknowledge their gate which is no longer gating. This movie is the smash hit sequel to a trendsetting critical darling; the argument was won the second Miles was protagonist and the movie(s) was awesome.

"When the credits started to roll, I just thought ""Dude, you can't end it like that..."" I usually don't feel that way about films, but overall I'd consider it a good sign that I wanted more. 

The spectacular visuals almost go without saying. I also enjoyed that we got a more fleshed out story for Gwen. Humor wasn't as great as the first film, but I think there was probably a greater ratio of seriousness to humor on purpose. 

I have to qualify my praise a bit though. There's a lot going on in this film, and sometimes it feels like it could have afforded to take more of a breather. I'm also not sure how to feel about the Miles Prowler storyline they've introduced (since the third film isn't out yet, obviously), but it could end up being thematically interesting.

Miguel didn't sugarcoat the truth at all to Miles. Poor guy. My sense is that the story might end up having a ""Twelve Angry Men"" echo to it, in the sense that Miles starts off alone, but gradually convinces others of his way of thinking (that there might be a way to ""do both""). Well, with the people Gwen recruited, that's already starting to happen.

"I'm concerned that Beyond the Spider-Verse would create a solution for Miles's moral dilemma where both the multiverse and his father are saved.  
  
The core question posed in Across the Spider-Verse is whether a Spider-Person needs to suffer loss and sacrifice in order to be ""Spider-Man"", the hero that pushes through all the pain and gets back up to do the right thing. Miles refusing to allow his father to die and striving to find a way to save both Jefferson and the multiverse is a very Spider-Man thing to do, but experiencing that loss and learning to move forward is an even more Spider-Man thing to do. Finding a loophole in Miguel's framing of Miles's moral dilemma (like in the case of Gwen's father, George Stacy) would reward or justify Miles's selfishness in spite of the consequences presented to him, regardless of how understandable it is that he'd want to save his father, one of the two most important people in his life. Gwen's dad being exempt from this ""canon"" rule is fine because it's implied in the film that she's come to accept that she's needs to lose her father regardless of her love for him, and chooses to embrace responsibility. She's already figured out the lesson. Her role in the film isn't to help Miles rescue is father, it's to help Miles make his own decisions founded on his own experiences and his own feelings, not Miguel's nor a Spider Society's.  
  
I would love BTSV to give a firm stance on the question it poses on what makes Spider-Man who he is or who they are. And if the film chooses to state that being Spider-Man doesn't necessitate sacrifice and loss, it then really really needs to address Miles's selfishness and find another way for him to learn the lesson that his world is going to crash around him all the time now and in the future, that he can't save everyone, not even his loved ones, but he still needs to find a way to continue forward and be a hero for everyone else. His Uncle Aaron's death wasn't enough, he didn't have the power nor the confidence to rescue or protect his uncle then. This is an entirely new lesson where even equipped with great power and capability, he needs to understand that he's going to lose people in trying to do the right thing.  
  
Earth-42 Miles entrance into the story adds layers to this moral dilemma. As other posts on this subreddit have pointed out, it's implied that the spider that bit Earth-1610 Miles was ""supposed"" to bite Earth-42 Miles. While our Miles isn't at fault for the state of this other Miles's Earth and his descent into villainy, he's now who this other Miles was supposed to be, he's an anomaly that wasn't meant to be Spider-Man, but he is, so now he's responsible for helping this version of himself as well as this world. His experience in Earth-42 could teach him that his life and decisions are no longer his own. Additionally, while Earth-42 Miles doesn't seem to care about his alternate universe father, Miguel's backstory may foreshadow that this Miles might try to replace our Miles in Earth-1610. In doing so, this Miles may actively try to prevent losing another version of his father, and this may ""break canon"" and begin to unravel Earth-1610. Our Miles may have to actively choose to sacrifice his father (who as a morally righteous figure may want to sacrifice himself anyways), to defeat his villainous self as well as Spot.  
  
ATSV transitions Miguel from a brooding tragic deterministic Spider-Man into one violently fixated on fate and destiny. We're given scenes and dialogue that would encourage us to disagree with Miguel that he's the ""good guy"" despite his insistence that he is. This pushes us to empathize and side with Miles and his feelings more. But if Miguel's presentation of the multiverse situation at hand is true (which sets up an amazingly meta version of Spider-Man's unending trolley problem, I really don't want the filmmakers to wuss out and make loopholes), then he's right, regardless of how much of a douche he is. We're faced with difficult decisions constantly in life, often involving loss and sacrifice to varying degrees of severity. To give Miles an out of this dilemma makes this Spider-Man story less impactful and less relatable . Spider-Man and his world are fictitious, but the experiences and ideas fundamental to his character are very real (that's why I fell in love with the character). We're not insulated from loss, hardship, and the need to try to keep going.  
  
I like that the movie ended on a cliffhanger, it gives the audience time to really think about Miles's moral dilemma before the next film gives its own stance to the problem.  
  
Edit: A really great sequence of events that really illustrates Miles's dilemma is him being confronted by his family and school counselor on trying to ""eat his cake and have it too"". Miles asserts that he'd just bake two cakes. Later, for his dad's promotion celebration party, he does purchase two cakes, both of which end up ruined.",2023-06-02
"I liked it. I think the biggest issue with this movie is that it is split into two parts and so this movie REALLY feels incomplete after leaving the theater, and Im not a fan of that. At least Infinity War is it's own movie and can be watched in isolation. This movie cannot, and thats troubling. It was a mistake to end it on a cliffhanger, and thats bugging me quite a lot, the more I sit on it. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this move. Funnily enough, I thought the first half was far stronger than the second half, which is apparently an unpopular take here. The first hour had me totally engaged, loving every second of it. The India Mannahaten scene didnt really work for me as well. Overall, id say a solid 7.5/10, perhaps an 8/10 if i am to count how amazing it looked visually.",2023-06-02
"I think it's a great first half of a 4 hour movie. Only having half a story means youve got a few issues 

* No complete arcs for characters means I'm not as attached to them. I don't care for Hobie, Indian spider man etc like I do the guys in the first film. Part of that is that the guys in the first films had full arcs. 

* A bit too decompressed. The movie didn't need an hour before Gwen met Miles again. Spider verse 1 showed how you could tell a powerful story in such a short space of time. Gwen's intro in 1 is so emotional and it's like 40 seconds long. 

* As a result of it being too long and having incomplete arcs, it's all setup and no payoff. We spent the first hour with miles' family but there was no payoff so it felt like a waste of time. We learnt about spider society but didn't find out anything about 2099s true motivations so it felt like a waste. A 2 parter needs payoffs in the first half. 

Like I say it's a great first half of a film but it does not stand as a movie in itself.

Plus it doesn't have as many memorable moments as the first. The only moment in this that sticks in my head is Gwen's intro. In the first film you had Peter B's intro, leap of faith, the alchemax break in (a real highlight), spider man's death, so many moments.",2023-06-02

Although I don't think I like the idea of Miles being an anomaly or a mistake. Peter was already an accident but it was destined. Now one of the pioneers that pushed for diverse versions of characters ""was never meant to be"".",2023-06-03

"Question:  Was the spider that bit Miles from Miguel's universe?  We saw Miguel shooting himself up with something and they say that he's unlike the other spiders.  Also, he seems to be personally angry with Miles when they are fighting on the train.  Also, Miles asks if Miguel is even a spider at all since he uses claws to climb.

I took this as the 42 spider was from Miguel's universe and was \*supposed\* to bite him but it got teleported.  So, Miguel somehow figured out about the multiverse and his supposed role in it and made that chemical he injected himself with to become a spider person anyway.  Part of him hates Miles for getting the powers he was supposed to have.  Therefore, the universe we see Miles in at the end is Miguel's.

I can't tell if I'm way off here and I'm reading too much into things or if this was obvious and I just missed some dialogue or something.",2023-06-04

"One thing I don’t think any of the reviews mentioned was that this movie pulled off an even greater version of narrative decoys than Infinity War. In that movie, the Avengers weren’t the protagonists of the story; Thanos was the protagonist as he’s the one going the proverbial hero’s journey in the film. In Across the Spider-Verse, Miles and The Spot are BOTH decoys as the protagonist and antagonist respectively, as the true protagonist and antagonist of this film are Gwen Stacy and Miguel O’Hara.",2023-06-04
A 10/10 movie with beautiful and amazing animations styles and storytelling between Miles and Gwen. A movie which I should have taken a picture near a poster or something for memory but I didn’t. The Excitement for the continuation is uncontrollable because of the cliffhanger and it’s gonna be a heck of a wait because I’m a teenager who like Miles doesn’t know what to be and do in life. Last time I was this excited was with How to train you dragon the hidden world because that was one of my favorite animated movie as a child.       Really not sure how they will beat the expectations like this one but I’m confident in Sony. Also did anyone notice how Miguel said “We are” to all spider people? To me it’s like he didn’t tell everything and is hiding something. Just a guess. Who thinks Miles will make himself a new suit?,2023-06-04
It all felt so uncompromoised. It really felt as if everybody working on this were given the reigns and gave it their all to this movie.,2023-06-04
Is it fair to say that miguel o hara is basically a giant Spider-Man fanboy who’s mad that miles isn’t the perfect Spider-Man that he envisioned? I see many comic fanboys who treat comic book miles the exact same way because he doesn’t go through enough tragedy or because he is black.,2023-06-04

"I was disappointed there was no 90s animated series Spider-Man series. How did they not have this!? Did I miss it? Maybe they’re saving it for the third movie..? 

Also, how can every Spider-Man version not be able to take down Myles? I get it’s his movie but I felt that was a big stretch. He’s so new and yes he has the electric powers but EVERY Spider-Man vs him!? Cmon. 

I feel like I’m the only one who was a bit disappointed with the movie. It was good but not great for me. Maybe it was the theatre I went to. Will definitely have to watch it again

"I have to questions:

1) Is Spot an actual villian in the comics. Is it just me or does he not seem very formidable as a villian. At the start he seemed to be comic relief.

2) How was Miles so easily able to go through the portal to access the multiverses? I would have thought the last Spiderman / Spiderwoman that enters the portal makes 100% sure noone is follwing them, even have a device that creates a forcfeield / buffer, so one is able to enter through the portal except them.",2023-06-05

Movie was fucking great.  It re-affirms frankly the need to see movies in theaters to have the full impact as well as the medium of animation being the best to adapt superhero comics properly. This would have been trillions of dollars if done live-action.,2023-06-05
"I loved the animations! I loved the movie!

But for some reason I had no emotional connect with Gwen and her father arc. It just seemed boring and well trodden path which has already been done in almost all superhero movies. 

And the audio being too low for the initial scenes didn't help either.",2023-06-05

"My full spoiler-heavy thoughts:

Gonna start with my main negatives first because I don't want to end on a negative. This movie is quite possibly the clearest ""second in a trilogy"" I've ever seen. The entire movie feels like a second act (because it is), the pacing suffers at times as a result, and it was painfully clear from the beginning that it was going to end on a cliffhanger. The entire movie essentially from opening to credits feels like buildup. ~~In four years~~ Apparently next year??? when the final movie is out I don't think I'll look back on this as much of an issue. In the moment, it's a bit unsatisfying. The first movie worked much better as a standalone, probably because they weren't sure if it would become a trilogy yet.

My other, slightly more nit-picky, complaint is that the side characters in this movie don't get enough time. In the first movie, Spider-Noir (Nicholas Cage's best role, don't @ me) and the other side spider people got the perfect amount of screentime. In this one, I loved Hobie's character but they really just mostly used him as comic relief and only for a pretty short time. Other than Peter B being back and still great, pretty much all the other non-main characters were very forgettable.

However, maybe that's forgiveable, because the main characters in this movie have a *lot* going on. Miles's plot is excellent but he stays more-or-less the same person that he was at the end of the first movie throughout this one. The two main emotional driving forces of this movie are Miles's relationship with his parents, and Gwen. Miles is still ostensibly the protagonist, but Gwen's arc anchors the movie, and is the emotional center. The two scenes with her and her dad that bookend the film are for me the most emotional and powerful moments in the entire movie. It's incredible stuff. (As an aside, as far as the whole trans Gwen thing goes, I think it's a pretty clear metaphor but I think it would be even cooler if in the final film they just outright state it, not as an easter-egg or hidden detail, but just make it a central part of her character. Will it happen? Prooooooobably not, but I think it's entirely possible and would be based as fuck.)

Miles's arc is also great, and I like the way they focused more on his parents this time around, it prevents the movie from just retreading the same ground. I love that he's confident throughout the entire movie. They didn't feel the need like many series do to take a step backwards and force him to go through the same arc as the first movie; he's working through an entirely new set of problems now, but he never loses the swagger he gained.

The villains in this movie are also great. I don't really have much to say here, other than that the way it manages to have two completely distinct sets of villains with both being terrifying while being completely different and *at odds with each other* is excellent, and I'm very interested to see what they do with them in the conclusion.

Speaking of things that are excellent, let's talk about the animation in this movie. I went in expecting it to be great but a part of me was worried that it wouldn't push any new ground compared to the first movie. Holy FUCK am I glad to be wrong. This movie is a visual **masterpiece** from start to finish. Takes the brilliant stylization of the first movie and plugs it directly into an amplifier. The scene at the start with the DaVinci bird thing instantly dispelled any of my worries. The way each dimension is clearly stylized differently while somehow all feeling cohesive and part of the same world (well, technically not, but you get it) is masterful. Every action sequence is jaw-dropping in style, animation, choreography... it's all just insane and an absolute visual spectacle. And non-action scenes look universally beautiful. I love the story but this is comfortably the selling point of the movie and it's an 11/10.

The soundtrack is great. Maybe not quite as original-feeling as the first film, but consistently excellent nonetheless.

The Glover cameo was completely out of nowhere and the whole theater gasped at it. Felt slightly out of place but that didn't really matter.

The humor is excellent throughout, there were a couple of misses but overall it was hilarious but knows when to step back for a proper tone.

Overall: 8.5/10. Has the aforementioned pacing issues, and I can nitpick other stuff, but from start to finish it's an exciting, emotional, stunningly beautiful roller-coaster ride.",2023-06-06

"I watched the movie yesterday and he more I think about it the more the ending feels like they had a full movie they could show show in 2 hours 30 min. But decided to rework it and extend the last 30 mins I to a whole new movie.

It really seems like there is not that much plot left.

I know it seems it was announced at the beginning as part one and two (and then removed from the marketing which annoyed all my theater when we got blue balled in the end). But maybe the movie originally was going to be shorter.",2023-06-07
"Just saw it yesterday and really enjoyed it, but was low-key disappointed that Gwen's universe wasn't 42. They made a big deal of how unique she is in the beginning, being a Gwen that doesn't fall for Spiderman, doesn't die tragically, and even later in the film with her dad quitting meaning she doesn't have the police captain tragedy to worry about anymore (or at least on the same level as before). Would have been an interesting twist if you found out that Miles wasn't the ""first"" anomaly, but Gwen is. Maybe that's a twist in Beyond.",2023-06-07

Decent film. Great characters. This is probably the best representation of the multiverse I've seen but I'm still not really into the concept.

"Is anyone going to answer how morales didnt notice world 42 wasnt his world when it is in a totally different state?

The only unique spidermans are the indian, vamipre and jacket ones, every other spiderman is exactly the same and no other spiderman but the main ones even interact with morales.  


So many spidermans had asses as cakes, literal cakes man, I dont know who of the artists sneked that in but it is insane the level of cakes that they had.

"I watched this with my kids yesterday, very mixed bag. We all groaned at the cliff hanger but enjoyed a lot the characters, animation and performances. I hated the opening 20 minutes in Gwen's dimension. The color styling, massive brush strokes and inconstancy of the shots hurt my eyes so much I wanted to leave. I put my sunglasses on instead. My eyes were happy when we went back to Miles' dimension. 

Spot was an odd villain, no menace, sort of goofy but clearly murderous by the end. He didn't work for me. The constant combination of styles and textures was very cluttered. The Vulture's art style was so jarring along with Spider-Punk that it feels more like sloppy collage than anything else. The visual excess overwhelmed most of the action, and humor. All the best parts were with Miles and his family and Gwen.",2023-07-04

"I forgot that this film was going to be a trilogy so I was surprised at the ending, I thought we'd get our finale with Miles, Spot, and 2099. The ending with Miles transporting into the spider that bit Miles’ universe was a great twist which I didn't expect. Though I feel like it could've completed itself if Miles ended up in his universe. They built up Spot but he lives on to the next movie which is comical to have a D-list villain be the antagonist for two whole movies.

I didn't like the art style of this film, I felt like it was too much and there were too many different graphics that was going on. It's really difficult to immerse yourself in the movie when objects feel out of place. It had way too many styles and visual jargon making it difficult to focus basically if everything stands out nothing does. I'm also not a big fan of the environment of Spider-Gwen's and Spider-India's world, it looks like [Jackie Chan Adventures with filters on](https://s1.dmcdn.net/v/IaBOg1OL1UwIHYkb0/x1080), their universe does not look real.


The characters were great Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'Hara was menacing and the movie made Spot a convincing villain after he takes his transformation. The movie stays grounded with Miles' relationship with his parents and as well with Gwen. Outside of the constant bombardment of visual animation style that could cause a mild seizure, I thought the movie was great. Though I don't know if the movie is worthy of a sequel.",2023-06-03

"When Miles got to Nueva York and met VR Spider chick, I noticed Gwen was always trying to get him to go, if you look at her face while he was talking to cute VR spider, I think Gwen was jealous. Anyone notice that?",2023-06-05
"My only two complaints is that I feel like Miguel should have explained the idea of determinism a bit better and made it more universal instead of sounding like only Spiderpeople are influenced by the deterministic nature of the Multiverse or something. The way it sounded is if other people are saved that aren't related to spidermen then nothing happens, only the universe collapses if an uncle ben is saved or something. I think presenting the idea as universal determinism would sound a bit more mature and makes it sound like stopping miles would actually make sense, because as it seems it sounds like Miles would only doom his own universe (if at that considering he's an anomoly to begin with and never doomed his universe).

The other complaint i have is that they shouldn't have any references to live action movies. I think this universe (or Multiverse) should stay its own property and independent from the live action movies, because the only thing it does is now bring scrutiny to the other properties(like how technically nobody in Toby's life died as a captain of a police force). Also i want to think as little about the shitshow that is the MCU as possible, so tying this universe in with that turd just didn't bring anything positive to this movie imo.

Those are minor complaints and this movie is still incredible. I just wanted to throw out the things i thought could be improved because everyone is already saying what it does so so well.",2023-06-05

Still really, really enjoyed it though.",2023-06-02
I don't understand how strong the prowler's motivation can be to hurt or kill his doppelganger. It's insane that his and uncle Aaron's first instinct would be to kill or torture Miles.,2023-06-02
"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" has a runtime of 139 minutes and 56 seconds, making it around 20 minutes longer than its predecessor, ""Into the Spider-Verse."" The extended duration is expected to be worthwhile.",2023-06-02
Fuck that ending idc,2023-06-02
"Stunning animation, really a game changer. These movies have done wonders for the genre. The references to other Spider-Man properties are wonderfully done and I think it's almost impossible to not enjoy this film. I don't think it's as good as the first one though for a couple of reasons.  
  
Firstly there are just too many scenes with the parents. This film touches on many great themes but I just feel like they keep on hammering on the feelings of love and family just way too much. Some of these scenes are just too long.  
  
The first film was about 2 hours but had an alt version which was 20 mins longer of unfinished scenes. It feels to me like this film also should have been 2 hours, but this time they fully developed the 20 mins of deleted scenes and put them in the base movie. The pacing suffered as well, with Miles not even showing up until 20 minutes have passed at the beginning.  
  
It also annoyed me how this is very much a 'Part 1' and literally ends in the middle of a scene on a very abrupt cliffhanger. We did know this already going into it but it's still frustrating knowing there's a year-long wait. I also thought it was a bit lame that the main villain is just a minor underling from the first movie.  
  
It's also worth pointing out I'm not a fan of multiverse stuff in general so this film did go a little too far in terms of 'variants' for my liking. I liked seeing 4 or 5 in the first movie, but when it gets to seeing thousands of Spider-Man it ruins the concept of the main character to me.",2023-06-03
"Incredible movie. I can’t say a lot that others haven’t already said. Easy 10/10 and best superhero film this year for me, which is saying a lot because GotG Vol. 3 was also incredible.

A couple of nitpicks:

Why didn’t Miles turn invisible when he was running from all the other Spider-People? Either he forgot or it’s hard to be invisible while also running and using all his other powers. Either explanation works for me. I think I prefer if his invisibility isn’t used too much because it’s extremely overpowered. It’s one of those abilities you kind of have to write around.

It was a little silly that Miles was able to tail Gwen after talking to his mom for a couple of minutes. She would’ve been long gone. My headcanon is that she left a trail of webs. We never see them because of movie magic, but realistically a Spider-Person always leaves a trail of danglies to follow.",2023-06-03

"I'm in the minority where I actually prefer the visual style of Into the Spider-Verse. Across the Spider-Verse is undoubtedly more ambitious frame by frame. But Into the Spider-Verse edited together much more smoothly than the visual overload on display here. Less was more, IMO.

I loved how detailed Into the Spider-Verse. I have the blu-ray and I used to pause it and parse through every frame. But Across the Spider-Verse cranks that visual overload to the point of overkill IMO. There are scenes that will look better paused than they do in motion.,2023-06-03

"Loved the movie. The attention to detail and story were phenomenal. 

But I have a question. If Peter B Parker (with baby) is supposed to be from Earth 616, but Tom Holland's is also from 616, was this intentional or a mistake? Miguel mentions ""the little nerd with Dr. Strange"" so we can assume the animated one and Tom are not the same.",2023-06-03
"10000/10. Not just the greatest spider-man movie ever, one of the greatest animated works ever created. Emotional, powerful, beautiful, amazing character depth and realistic relationships. The work they put into the different animation styles was insane.

Love how much focus on Miles and his parents’ relationship we got as well as Gwen and her dad. The inclusion of tobey, Andrew and the MCU stuff… and the video game stuff.. everything was just perfect for me.

Movie really felt like a comic book brought to life and I love that they had the actual comics that certain storylines and events were borrowed from. The Easter egg video for this is going to be so fun to watch.

Metro soundtrack not only lives up to the original, but surpasses it. That ending scene with Gwen putting her own team together and heading into the portal… goosebumps.

"The movie is great, and the best Spider-Man film IMO. But the plot does have details I need a light on (or need to rewatch at least)

1. Is the Indian Spider-Man already part of the society when we first see him? Kinda weird if his canon event hasn’t happened yet.

2. Most of the society didn’t about canon events, right? Cos why would most of them go along with it?

3. Why would a canon event need to happen for an anomaly like Miles?

4. Isn’t one canon event enough for Miles (his uncle dying)?",2023-06-04
Why wasn't Nic Cage's Spider-Man in this film? Because he was too busy fighting a spider in another dimension 😉,2023-06-04
"Thoughts on the movie


Am I the only one who thinks that all of them acted out of emotions? Miles, immediately starts to deny everything Miguel said when he literally could destroy the whole multiverse if he breaks a canon event (i get why but still man, you're spiderman. Yknow the responsibilites) Miguel, does not even try to find any other way and wants everything to go his way (isnt being spiderman like not giving up). Gwen, runs away from her problems rather than facing it (which turns out to be the right decision btw to actually he honest)

Honesty was such a big theme in this movie. A lot of things could've been solved if they were all honest with each other.


Nitpicks

Also loved the movie alot, just felt like Miles' plot armor was off the charts on this one. He outsmarted hundreds of Spider-men who all have more experience than he does???? Like bro, he could've gone to like a spider-prison or smth first then escape with his electric powers and just use his stealth to try and escape. Does that mean that if an Electro anomaly gets caught, he can easily get out like Miles? That's my only nitpick in this movie. Everything else was phenomenal.",2023-06-04
Miles Morales ending up in the wrong dimension would’ve hit harder if they didn’t show Earth-42 on the screen before he teleported. Cheapened his reveal to his mom knowing that dimension didn’t have a Spider-Man to begin with,2023-06-04
"I have no way of proving this, but I predict that in the 3rd movie they’re going to turn Earth 42’s Miles into Spider-Man. Or if there’s no spider, convince him to prowl for good. Either way we’ll get a comic book cover (I hope).",2023-06-04
"After this movie I wish the entire MCU was just fully animated, because that would be wild",2023-06-04
"Meta commentary: 
When writers try to go against the standard spiderman canon events like death of uncle or captain or gwen stacy (after in an relationship to spiderman) the story or production gets axed by the studios (apparently the most powerful entity in the multiverse). 

Miles morales is an attempt by the writers by breaking those conventions/expectations and making this a bigger success not just with the audience but also the studios (who made tons of cash because of the success)!",2023-06-04

"The art and action sequences were beautiful, loved all the small little references to other spider-man media, but the film was let down by being a two parter. It just dragged on and on introducing a character just to forget about them after 5 minutes and it felt it was always building up to something with no payoff.

Miguel was 100% right, one life shouldn't be worth more than billions. Hopefully they find a smart way in the next movie to write that bad shit happens and you can't do anything about it. Would be a very frustrating trilogy if the message was just, oh try hard enough and you become omnipotent.",2023-06-21

That’s my only small complaint. I wouldn’t change a single frame of anything else. I just feel they could have given Miguel a bit more than the algorithm told me bro, I’m just following orders. I felt like he should have been more empathetic towards Miles the way Dr Strange was to Peter in “Spider-Man no way home”. Miguel was more like no bro STFU, fuck your dad. That’s just the cost of being Spider-Man, get over it. 

As if anyone sane is supposed to just accept their father dying as a cost of doing business.

I loved seeing all the other Spider-Man’s but Indian Spider-Man with his yo-yo allowing him to do cooler things like that was creative as fuck and giving the hundred others ones slightly cool variants must have taken forever. Not sure how miles got away like that outsmarting everyone when he still doesn’t come across as being that genius 4 steps ahead guy but idk it seemed almost east for him.

And I’m not a big fan of the cliffhanger tbh, put the characters in mortal danger, let them lose the battle, sure no problem. But it felt like the battle hadn’t even started and I have no worries Miles would break out easily. So it was a very abrupt and not a great place to end. So I guess my main problem is I wanted more movie",2023-06-03
"Just watched it a few hours ago. Amazing film, have almost no negative comments about it besides it being a part 1. 

Not sure if anyone else saw but, was the scene towards the end with Miguel walking on the roof referencing the Spider-Man walking meme? Had the exact same angle and look 🤣🤣🤣",2023-06-03
I'm gonna get shit on but while I liked the movie a lot I hated the way they did the cliffhanger ending. It would have worked better as a TV show but for a stand alone movie I think you need to resolve some sort of immediate conflict. I was blown away that people clapped but I'm in the minority here so whatever.,2023-06-03

"After watching this movie and hearing about the inevitable live action adaptation of Miles, SURELY this is the Miles we get in the MCU.

Audiences already identify with this Miles, so redoing his origin story would be a hard sell and to top it off they've essentially laid the groundwork to transport him to the MCU.

Call it wishful thinking, but I believe Beyond the Spider-Verse will result in this version of Miles making it into the MCU. It's too perfect not to.",2023-06-04
"Really good except:

Comedic lines don’t hit the same with Miles and Parents

Gwen voiced by Hailee steinfeld. voice is sort of annoying 

a lot of dizzying scenes

animation was very clunky and overloaded with different mediums verse the 1st movie

cliffhanger 

the other spidermen being such followers and unspectacular

**downvotes** i loved the movie and plan on seeing it a second time in theatres.    The animation in the first movie was better. there was too many mediums in this one",2023-06-04
"On my first watch this movie was hard to look at: too much going on, animation looked unfinished, too much flashiness, and it was giving me a headache. Maybe on my second watch it’ll be better but yeah kind of overhyped imo, first one was better",2023-06-06
" Miles is much better written than Holland's Peter. We know everything Miles wants, everything he enjoys his pass time, what he will do next, etc. This Gwen is likely trans, she has a trans flag in her room. Her father has a trans flag too. All her colors are trans colors. Things are not just put into films, it's always a reason. It would make sense because Miles would not care if she trans. Miles is a great person. Their relationship is more than lust, at least on miles side. I didn't like Gwen in the end because Miles never lied to Gwen sadly she lied to him. Hopefully she makes it up to Miles big time. What she did to Miles was really messed up.",2023-06-08

dragged first 1hr 15min with no main plot. \
spot villain does not get enough screen time and idk where he gone. \
sometimes vfx gone bad that it feels like powerpoint presentation of comic sketch book. \
they put more time on cringe fast paced unnecessary dialogues than to show main villain and canon points. \
there were some rememberable scenes in first film. \
now if u think about some rememberable scenes, u will notice they dragged af. \

I kept thinking why Miguel and them did not want Miles in the Spiderclub. Then I realized lol. MY god that reveal that he was in the wrong universe WOW! Really liked Hailees acting in this as well. Also sidebar but Gwen is really hot! I had a feeling there would be a cliffhanger and when they played that inspirational music during Gwens speech I was like ""yup credits coming in 3,2,1...."" CANNOT wait for the third part in March!",2023-06-02
"Fucking 10/10.
The movie was gorgeous from start to even the credits. Music was fantastic. My only criticisms are that the audio for some of the characters seem off and the movement in the spider city was very frantic and I got a little dizzy.
The story was well done. Gwen’s arc was amazing. I did guess the twist that Miles wasn’t at his home from the different color and the dialogue with his mom was very odd.
I really like the Meta criticism of canon.
The soundtrack was amazing.
I was surprised that the movie was 2 hours. It felt like such a rush and the guy next to me at the end was pissed and said that Beyond better be next year and I said it was.😆",2023-06-02

Earth 42 has the worst mom. How could she not tell that wasn't her Miles? Honestly the whole Earth 42 sequence didn't make sense. I sure hope they explain how Uncle Aaron and Alt Miles seem to already know about alternative universes. They didn't seem phased at all about a whole other Miles existing. And how does Alt Miles knock out Spiderman. He doesn't have his spider senses anymore? Why does Alt Miles already hate this new Miles so much. So many questions.,2023-06-03

"I dont think this movie had enough from the first movie to grant a sequel. The donut guy is a super arching villain? and it's supposed to be convincing that the spider that bit him in the first movie was a mistake? as well as how the original team members couldn't visit Miles? Because the movie had more screentime about the multiverse and its implications etc. This movie felt more about Miguel and Spot, minus the actual build up to their backgrounds. There's the parent and relationship drama, but with them being teens and this movie clearly being part of the mcu, there will be no real sacrifices to any of that drama. I just can't root for young teen drama or villains that are angsty with paper thin reasoning. Looks cool tho.",2023-06-12

"this was probably the worst movie I've seen in a theater.

Visuals were completely over the top and gave me a headache. These styles could have worked well in small doses, or even medium doses, but it was just unrelenting.

Plot was a muddled mess. Is Spot destroying the multiverse? Or does he need to kill Miles' dad to save the multiverse? What course of action are the different spider-factions even trying to accomplish and why?

The emotional side was just completely dead weight, all these heavy emotional dialogues between people with no real sense of what their conflict even was or what was resolved.

The animators did do an incredible job. Many stunning compositions.",2023-06-03

Release the cut without the live-action crap,2023-06-03
"This is not sending the right message. That was my main though while watching the movie. Miles trying to save his father, although it will destroy his universe, is such a generic trope about doing the opposite of what everyone tells you to do, to follow your heart, be individual. For once they could have gone with 'sometimes it is wise to listen to the people who are more wise than you  and make a hard sacrifice'.

Another thing I don't like about the story is that I cannot relate to Miles and his life problems, cause his life is just easy. He is healthy, lives in New Your, has rich supportive parents and is basicly setup for life. Moreover, with his superpowers he can swing between skyscrappers and do some casual fights with bad guys that apparently don't do him much trouble. Miles main life problems are much forced. Let me list them:
• Parents are worried about him, because it seems like he is out doing drugs and premature sex and he cannot tell them he is a spider-man.
• His friends from the spiderverse haven't visited him because of procedures. Complaining about that makes him a total drama queen.
• He is 'not-the-choosen-one', because someone else was supposed to be bitten by a spider. Miquel O'Hara makes it into a big deal instead of just being reasonable.  Being bitten is not something Miles had any influence on, much like all the 'choosen-one' spider-men. 

Moreover, Miles doesn't seem to have any reedeming qualities. The though to help cure Spots and free him out of his misery hasn't crossed his mind. He 'kicked his butt' and he is  done. This movie shows that without the cool spider powers and a dad, he would quickly become a heartless Prowler. It takes so little.

As Stan Lee said, Peter Parker was such relatable superhero, because he was a loser, he had many faults, but he kept trying to do better. Miles is probably relatable to the current young generation as they are much more wealthy, has less responsibility and less concerns. They don't need deep emotional scenes. If you play them some sad music during a scene they will think it is deep and emotional. This is not sending the right message.",2023-06-03

Not going to dwell on any spoilers for now, but it's outstanding how everybody involved was able to perfectly balance deep, emotional storytelling with vibrant, fast-paced visuals that exhaust the senses in the best way possible. It also boasts some fantastic themes of ""canon"", a sense of belonging, and willingness to chart your own story that I truly believe will resonate with a lot of black kids (as well as the audience in general -- don't get me wrong). My only criticism is that it's a Part One, which I fully knew going in, and the cliffhanger was so well-done that the whole theater went bananas when it ended. Lol.

Am I the only one seeing the blatant Guren Lagann reference?,2023-06-02
Holy shit it's been a while that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I forgot this was a two parter and was wondering how are they going to wrap this up when 2hours has already past and they introduced another villain,2023-06-02
"So… J. K. Simmons was ALL of the J. Jonah Jamesons, right?",2023-06-02
"Can anyone explain why Peter B. Parker was in the collapsing universe with O'Hara? I'm really struggling to figure out the chronology on how that could have come to pass, them hanging out before the event that caused him to start the Spider Society.",2023-06-02
SPIDER-REX AHHH,2023-06-02
"Loved the movie, but no explanation for the change of the dad's last name from Davis to Morales. Continuity stuff always bugs me.

Edit: I'm aware the character changes his name in the comics and explains why to Miles. But a quick five second line could have explained that in the movie. People who don't read the comics are going to be confused as to why his changed.",2023-06-02
Love that bagels are now instrumental to at least two multiverse movies.,2023-06-02
This movie was absolutely astonishing. Legit every single frame could double as a physical piece of art for one’s home. Can’t believe I liked this more than the first film.,2023-06-02
I might have missed it and might have a decent idea but was it ever explicitly stated what Hobie and Gwen’s relationship was?,2023-06-02
"There's so much to unpack in this wonderful movie, but two scenes stick out in my mind. 

First, the scene where Gwen and Miles hang upside down and just look out at the reflected New York skyline was just beautiful. The visual fidelity and creativity with the set piece, the humor with Miles' hand movements, and the emotional nature of seeing two people who truly recognize how special they are to each other.

Second, Renaissance Vulture is incredibly valid for destroying a Jeff Koons piece. Based af.",2023-06-02
"There's one aspect of the plot I'm not sure I understand. So what was Gwen's actual reason for being sent to Miles' universe? Was she supposed to survey Spot or capture him?

It's mentioned later she and Peter B. Parker knew that Miles' father was supposed to die as a canon event... but Miguel wouldn't have approved her stopping the Spot if he was supposed to fulfill said canon event. Unless they only knew that Miles' father was supposed to die, and only later figured out that the Spot was supposed to fulfill that prophecy.",2023-06-02
Severe lack of Spiders-man,2023-06-02
"Great, Great, great. 

But like a lot of other people, we had a problem with the audio -- but at the world famous Chinese Theater in Hollywood. You would think if anybody could get it right, it would be them. 

The center channel seemed too low.",2023-06-02
What game was Miles’s roommate playing? I played an old Spider-Man game years ago on the Wii but couldn’t make heads or tails when I saw it on screen,2023-06-02
Blade Runner Spider-Man 2099. Loved those shots.,2023-06-02
"10/10 movie. I’m genuinely not sure how they top this one, but then again, I wasn’t sure they could top the first one and they proved me very wrong there. Very much setting themselves up to stand among the greatest trilogies in film, period. 

Glad I’ve lived this long to see what peak animation could look like. That plot twist of the alternate universe Miles ends up in is ‘Darth Vader being Luke’s father’ levels of legendary too. I don’t know if there’s truly a flaw in this film between visuals, storytelling and sound (soundtrack was on fire too, loved that Ain’t No Love in the Heart of the City was being played in Aaron’s apartment and the end credits song was so heat too)",2023-06-02
"Where do we think the next part is going?
Presumably Miguel is wrong about the ‘Constant events’ and in some way Miles will be able to save his Dad?
Can’t work out if Miguel is wrong or knowingly lying. Maybe he killed himself in that other dimension so he could have his daughter back and that caused the glitch?
Also at some point doesn’t Miles say “are you sure you’re a Spider-Man” which made me wonder…is he? And if he’s not, what is he?",2023-06-02
Now I am actually curious if MCU live-action will have a part to play in the finale to also lead into Avengers Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars? 🤔,2023-06-02
"Anyone else think Miles has some hidden power unknown to him, similar to Elizabeth Comstock from bioshock infinite?


As in Miles can open portals to the multiverse himself and bring in people and objects to his location. The spider was glitching before it bit him...it's not completely unbelievable that the spider being from earth 42 gave miles an added multiverse ability.",2023-06-02

"What's the name of the song that plays at the beginning of the scene where Miles and Gwen are going to talk upside down?  
  
I'm not referring to the song Under the Clocktower... which I want to know the name of is the one that plays before that one, before the upside down conversation, I want to know the name of the song that plays right when they get to that place. Thanks in advance!",2023-06-02

Hope Genke will be on the gang for the next movie,2023-06-02
"As awesome as the cameos are, seeing Spider-People from across the franchise coming after Miles is also unsettling and sad because all of those iconic and lovable versions of the character are ultimately trying to force one of their own to experience the same tragedy they themselves did.",2023-06-02
"Anyone know the song that plays when Miles starts getting chased by the Spider Society, it plays over the cat and t-rex scenes, can't find it on either soundtrack!",2023-06-02
"Just as visually dazzling as the first one, if not better. Spider-Society episode is chef's kiss. Multiverse shenanigans are pretty fun but it's the character work that worked well.  
  
Liked the new additions in Spider-punk and Pavitr Prabhakar. Neat cliffhanger too.",2023-06-02
Is there mid or post credit scene?,2023-06-02
Can someone tell me if Supaidaman is in the film,2023-06-02
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Definitely top 2 super hero movies. Incredible. Could not believe the harsh cliffhanger,2023-06-02
We literally need some official wallpapers/posters from all the gorgeous frames in the movie.,2023-06-02
To be continued… if it was labeled as part 1 and if the next one was releasing the same year like they planned before I wouldn’t be mad. Literally heard some say in my language “aww come one!” Also why no what’s up danger,2023-06-02
I thought Jessica Drew Spiderwoman was a bit dull personality wise but otherwise I really enjoyed all the other Spider characters.,2023-06-02
"Movie was amazing, was a bit too close to the screen tho so it was a lot, definitely missed some stuff. Can't wait to rewatch at home and take in all the little details, maybe won't be as rewatchable as the 1st until Part 2 comes out but still a worthy sequel that really upped the ante on a lot of things",2023-06-02
Absolutely incredible movie but man there are some parts where the audio was bad and you need subtitles to understand what the characters are saying. I need the Best Buy steelbook ASAP,2023-06-02
"I have a few questions:

* Is Ben Reilly dead? Gwen stole his bracelet and yeeted him into a portal. So is he gonna glitch out and die?
* If Spider-punk left his bracelet when he quit, how did he go to Gwen's dimension and leave it with her dad?
* I was gonna ask why didn't Miles ever go invisible when trying to escape, but I assume it was to make it easy to lure all the spider-men away",2023-06-02

That is the best poll result I can remember,2023-06-02

Do we think Gwen’s team is going to expand in beyond?,2023-06-02
I bad-lucked at my showing into sitting next to a couple who wouldn't STFU and actively point things out on the screen and repeat lines they found funny. There was a moment that I probably would have clued into on my own regarding >!the universe that Miles Morales escaped to!< but they took that away from me.,2023-06-02
"Where exactly is Miguel and his team at the end of the movie, Earth-42 or Mile's original dimension? 

Also Miguel slaps hard in this movie; the way he cuts open the portal in that last moments was sick.",2023-06-02

Is the release date for the third movie confirmed?,2023-06-02
"Watched this one in IMAX with Laser. My first time. I felt picture was way sharper than normal IMAX and colours also felt vivid. 

I liked first one way more than this one. This one took way too long to come to interesting part and revelations. And right when I got excited for climax, ""To be continued"" flashed on screen to collective gasp of theater.

It was always gonna be difficult to top the first part of any movie with such a fresh take in any movie series, cause by second part you know what to expect, either premise or here presentation, which was still definitely top notch.

Enjoyed Donald Glover cameo as prowler, but that probably kills him being live action black spiderman dreams.",2023-06-02
"How bad are the flashing lights in this I’ve got epilepsy but don’t mind looking away at the more intense parts, the first one was pretty intense for me but manageable",2023-06-02
My prediction for the next movie is Mayday will be the kid Miles' dad tries to save and after a dramatic pause they'll copy that comic panel where a baby Mayday saves Mary Jane and aunt May from falling debris,2023-06-02
"I'm not super familiar with the source material, but it doesn't it also have a metacommentary underpinning on the importance or the nature of stories and mythos that repeat themselves across cultures? Like you could find stories from Greek and native American traditions that are similar to each other?

Also plug for Hadestown, besides banging tunes it also contextualizes tragic stories and the importance of re-telling them.",2023-06-02
"Hear me out, my theory is that Miles-1610 was meant to be the Prowler and Miles-42 was meant to be Spider-Man. But it got reversed after the Spot took the radioactive spider-42 to Earth-1610.

There was a flashback scene where Spot was narrating the origin of the spider, and it showed Braided Miles-42 at back of the spider. 

If it weren't for Spot, Peter Parker of 1610 would still be alive, stopped Green Goblin, Kingpin and Prowler at the collider. 

Miles-1610 will probably have to figure out to explain the situation and get away, maybe he'll find the reason why Earth-42 has no Spider-Man, or what caused this Miles' father's death.

I suspect he'll get a new suit in Beyond the Spider-verse. 

We'll probably have team Miguel and team Gwen fight-off and at the end, will probably be a battle vs. The Spot. 

It's funny coz in my head, it'll be like the Avengers Endgame thing where every Spider-People will portal to Earth-1610 to fight the Spot. (Then add in Leopardon, Tobey, Andrew and Tom)

Anyways, this is just my theory, I'm excited for the 3rd movie. And I love the two movies already.",2023-06-02
Was it known that this was part 1? Because i didnt know and went into this movie thinking i would see a story with a beginning and ending. I got very disappointed.,2023-06-02
This movie brings up some interesting ideas about “fixed” events within the multiverse and whether or not they can be safely changed but I feel like Miguel is wrong simply because if Miles’ really is an illegitimate spider-man it doesn’t make sense to hold his canon to the same standards as other spider-people.,2023-06-02
"This’ll probably get lost, but does anyone else get the vibe that Gwen was similar to Gwenpool? The pink ends on her hair are almost identical to Poole’s and the story breaking the fourth wall is the exact same way it was done in the GP comic. I don’t think it’s unlikely that we could see more of those parallels in Beyond.",2023-06-02
"Saw it last night, and am so moved. This is the type of movie that genuinely inspires me to be more creative and dream. 

I was simply blown away by the artwork and storytelling I was seeing on the big screen. Hats off to everyone involved.",2023-06-02
"I'm curious how they'll make another film. Everything was in place for the climax: Miles' dad was just promoted, Spot was coming back into Miles' verse, Miguel had the place staked out, Gwen was getting a band together to rescue Miles, etc. Seems like they could have just run another 30 minutes and probably had a good conclusion. 

So I just wonder how they'll be able to make another 2+ hour movie, especially since both of these films have done a LOT in their runtimes.",2023-06-02
"The Spot ended up looking like the ""Great/No Expectations"" art from the first movie",2023-06-02

maybe hes his worst version, with great power but no responsabilities, maybe hes even prowler miles' nemesis",2023-06-02
10 out of 10. loved everything about it. it will win the oscar,2023-06-02
My theory with universe 42 is that Peter Parker died even though Miles wasn’t bitten in that universe. I think we’re going to find out that Miguel was wrong about Miles not being fated to become a Spider-Man. That Peter would have died regardless.,2023-06-02
Ending gave me Halo 2 flashbacks.,2023-06-02

I loved Spider Cat!!,2023-06-02
"goddamn that was so good, personally i liked it more than the first, but man i wasn't expecting them to impress me more than the first with the animation but gwen's universe was so pretty. also this film makes you love miles even more than you might have already. and hobie too. what a cliffhanger",2023-06-02
“I’m not proud” 😂😂,2023-06-02
"Damn...I was aware that this was a part 1 but I wasn’t sure if it was going to be the type where it’s like a season ending with a conclusion and sequel hook or literally one movie split into two like it was. So the very direct cliffhanger really hit me like a truck as I did not think 2 and a half hours passed, it is what it is but I can’t blame people who are pissed about it",2023-06-02

"Maybe it's because I spent most of my time in Jersey (or I'm stupid, or both), but that whole ""NJ is too far from NY"" joke went way over my head. Is this like a New Yorker cultural thing?

"Maybe I'm thinking too far into this, but I loved the response by Ganke: "" Its a Slippery Slope.""

Mostly because the voice actor of Miles Morales - Shameik Moore played in the movie Dope (2015), which 'slippery slopes' were the whole perspective of that movie lol.",2023-06-02
The most visually dense movie since the first one,2023-06-02
"Anyone else sit near someone just laughing any time Pavitr Prabhakar or anyone else with that accent talked? Or was that just me living in racist Pennsyltucky?

Also the sound mixing was very Nolan-esque. I was at an IMAX and the beginning monolog by Gwen was drowned out by the drums. I've never been to an IMAX so I thought it was just that but apparently I wasn't the only one.",2023-06-02
Yeah I am furious at that ending. Had no idea.,2023-06-02
Awesome movie but it felt like it was concluding like 5 different times in the final 30 minutes making it feel drug out.,2023-06-02
Here's the [ending track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGwW4EHgV6o&ab_channel=SonySoundtracksVEVO) with the orchestral rockband backing. It's the most epic pairing of the two since Chris Cornell's Bond theme,2023-06-02
"Man, the last part.

When he gets in the machine you clearly see Earth-42 written on it and I thought ooooh he is going to *his spider’s universe*. And then the movie tricks you into believing he is in his own universe that I was like *huh, nevermind* and then yeaaah, that happened.",2023-06-02

I enjoyed it a lot. I liked the artwork and animation more than I thought. Didn't expect that they were going to set up for a third one. Of course they are going to make it since the movie is clearly going to be a hit,2023-06-03
OMG that ending! The person I watched it with thought Miguel had a point...or at least he was operating in a grey area. I do not know how they wrap up so many story threads. Hit all the right notes though.,2023-06-03
"The look Miles gave his counter self at the end . Like so much to take in with only moments. This Miles was suppose to be spider-man, Uncle Aaron lead him down a path his father would hate, the reversing of ideals. That look of fear to just a mirror understanding of what this situation is and knowing “yourself” well enough that one of you is probably not walking out this room alive.",2023-06-03
OOOO IM SO MAD RN,2023-06-03
"This is a small knit-pick of mine, but I hate the whole concept of characters not being able to stay in another dimension long term. Especially since we see that this is rarely a problem in the comics. There, we see characters regularly living in other universes and timeliness and it is fine. 

But I get why Sony and Disney are ignoring this for the film. It makes things almost too easy.",2023-06-03
The background paintings and color palettes changing as Gwen and her Dad talk at the beginning and end of the movie is up there with the best uses of color I’ve seen in a film. Damn that movie was good,2023-06-03

"I really liked Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I liked that it was more mature than the first as the characters grew up, and that it focused on heartfelt, impactful character moments and interactions.....instead of just being comedic and quippy and relying on the amazing animation. Also, the antagonists, The Spot, Spider-Man 2099, and The Prowler, were layered and not just one-note characters.... you could see their point of view to an extent.",2023-06-03

I could have watch another 2.5 hours with a quick intermission",2023-06-03

Miguel was the first to “verse jump” when he tried to get a family, no? Wouldn’t he be responsible for the anomaly and not Miles?

How did the Spider that bit Miles end up in another universe in the first place??

Isn’t it actually Miguel’s fault?

Also Gwen’s dad deciding on his own to step down seems to have not caused any effect in her universe as he stopped the Canon event. They might not have everything figured out with how they think things work in the universes in terms of how it makes a sinking hole like in India Spider-Mans universe.",2023-06-03

"spiderpunk: Sure there's a lot more spiderpunks than there was four years earlier, but there was also as many spider poseurs .spider Poseurs were people that looked like spider punks, but they did it for fashion. And they were spider fools. They would say ""anarchy in the Marvel Universe,"" you see, spider poseurs. ""anarchy in the marvel univerise,"" what the fuck is that? What good is that to those of us in Utah, America? It was a guardians thing. They were from space, they were alien, that's what they did. They were allowed to go on about anarchy in the universe. You dont live your life by lyrics.  
I mean that's all you ever heard from these trendy spider fucks. Like uh, did you hear the new Spider gwen album? It's fucking terif. Kids walkin' around Utah sayin' 'terif' with a stupid little English twang. See what I mean. (points to a jacket) What the fucks up with the English bullshit? Yeah, I knew a girl, a spider girl who would only have sex with a spider guy if he only had a fuckin' accent. Can you think of anything more ludicrous in your life? Cuz every asshole in new york and let me tell ya, plenty of assholes in this general region that wanna do a little a this will get her drunk and put on some kinda stupid fuckin' accent like, 'hey mistress, i got bit by a spider, d'ya fancy a shag?' Then she would, fuckin' knees to the sky, feet on the wall, which was sad, it made me really sad, poor spider girl had no self-respect. See to me, England was nothing more than a big fuckin' American state like North Dakota or Canada. You gotta look at me and you gotta say, hey spiderbuddy, why are you so mad and I'll tell ya, cuz for all the following that went over to the English bands from the SLC. Those fuckin English chaps can only say shit about us Americans, all we were to them was a bunch of hicks. Well you know what, I'm not a fuckin' hick. I don't wear cowboy boots, I hate the fuckin rodeo, horses smell like shit to me, and I never fuck anyone in my own bloodline. By definition I am not a redneck and goddammit I ain't no fuckin' hick. Oh the sun never sets on the British empire, well the sun never sets on my asshole.  
Another thing that pisses me off, talking about who started punk rock music. Was it the Sex Pistols in england, was it the Ramones and the Velvet Underground in New York? It was the Ramones, it was the Sex Pistols or spidergwen Who cares who started it, it's music. I don't know who started it, I don't give a fuck. The one thing I do know is that spiderpunks did it harder, we did faster, and we definitely did it with more love. You can't take that away from us.",2023-06-03
"spider punk: The Fight: What does it mean and where does it come from? An Essay:  
Homosapien. A man. He is alone in the universe.  spidermen. Still a man. He is alone in the universe, but he connects. How? They hit each other. Ooh! No clearer way to evaluate whether or not you're alive. Now, complications. A reason to fight. Somebody different. Difference creates dispute. Dispute is a reason to fight. To fight is a reason to feel pain. Life is pain. So to fight with reason is to be alive with reason. Final analysis: To fight, a reason to live. Problems and Contradictions: I am a spider anarchist. I believe that there should be no rules, only chaos. Fighting appears to be chaos and when we slam in the pit a show it is. But when we fight for a reason, like rednecks, there's a system. We fight for what we stand for, chaos, but fighting is a structure, to establish power, power is government and government is not anarchy. Government is war and war is fighting. The circle goes like this: our redneck skirmishes are cheap perversions of conventional warfare. War implies extreme government because wars are fought to enforce rules or ideals, even freedom. But other people's ideals forced on someone else, even if it is something like freedom, is still a rule; not anarchy. This contradiction was becoming clear to me in the fall of '85. Even as early as my first party, ""Why did I love to fight?"" I framed it, but still, I don't understand it. It goes against my beliefs as a true anarchist. But there it was. Competition, fighting, capitalism, government, THE SYSTEM. That's what we did. It's what we always did. Rednecks kicked the shit out of punks, punks kicked the shit out of mods, mods kicked the shit out of skinheads, skinheads took out the heavy metal guys, and the heavy metal guys beat the living shit out of new wavers and the new wavers didn't do anything. They were the new hippies. So what was the point? Final summation? None.",2023-06-03
"I absolutely loved the movie but there a few things rattling in my brain that I need to get out that maybe y’all can help with. 

A) right before Miguel orders the spider society to hunt miles, Spider Punk is seen taking off his dimension watch while walking back into his dimension. How does he gift Gwen another watch if he doesn’t have his anymore?

B) I started re-watching into the spider verse and noticed some possible inconsistencies, all from when Gwen briefly went over her backstory during the doc ock forest chase. First, she says she saved her dad from being killed (who doesn’t look anything like her dad currently). Wouldn’t that conflict with how her father feels towards spider woman in their universe and also conflict with her canon? And second, she mentions that her Peter dies and she couldn’t save him, but his death looks different from the one in across the spider verse. 

Again, none of this has been enough to change my opinion of the movies, but it’s just some little things that have been nagging in the back of my mind since watching Across the spider verse yesterday. If anyone has any input, I’d love to hear it!",2023-06-03
"That ending threw everyone off lol

Still so damn good",2023-06-03
"Loved this movie, I'm so happy they did Gwen justice. I wonder what it's like for the casual audience tho, it could get kind of happy.

Also, something stuck out to me about the Spider society. Miguel kept saying Miles shouldn't have been Spider-Man etc, but I think something core to the Spider-Man story is that none of them should have been Spider-Man. It was a seemingly random Spider that bit them and it was their choice to use that power for good to be Spider-Man, exactly like Miles and likely unlike Miles-42.

They were supposed to be the good guys, because they chose to be the good guys. Because with great power, comes great responsibility.

I think with the Spider sect breaking into Gwen's specialized task force, this point will be tested in the next movie. 

Also also, Miguel seems like he was the only one who made himself Spider-Man by the backstory snippets, with him injecting himself with the venom (but I'm not terribly familiar with 2099's backstory)

edit: rwatching the movie, MJ's eulogy for Peter is literally saying he was just a kid who happened to get bit, and he CHOSE to be Spider-Man",2023-06-03

I do find it hard to accept that pretty much every other Spiderman has accepted the Canon that certain things happen and certain people in their lives will die.

Also, when it was revealed he was in the wrong universe, I thought ""oh that's she didn't reboot the machine. She knew he was going somewhere else and semi sticks with Miguel's plan.""

"Why you gotta hurt me in the meow meow? 😭 (Cries in water color)

In all seriousness though, great movie. I don't usually watch a lotta emotional stuff and i didn't expect this one to be this emotional either but everything hit right in the spot.

I slept on it for a whole day and can still feel the emotions from it

I especially related to Miles while he struggled with not having anyone similar to share experiences with and then learning that there is a whole society of people like you that includes the girl you love as well and they just didn't invite you to it.

And then my heart broke all over again when Miles didn't realise what was going on and he thought they were finally letting him in instead of trying to punish  him for just existing. 

Also it's really funny to me that Miles knew he had a long fight ahead of him and he would be fighting it alone with very slim chances of the win but he still told Miguel ""I'mma do it my way"", like i know the doom is coming but I'll go out in style.

I knew this was part 1 going into it and we got almost 3 hours of it but damn if i can't wait to see the next installment. March come fast damn it",2023-06-03

"Sometimes the universe stuff trips me up, like movie miles is in the 1610 universe, but the 1610 universe is its own thing in the comic(ultimate universe), that’s pretty different from this one. The main similarity being that it has a Miles Spider Man, but still it would make sense to make the movies their own universe like 1611, especially since they have so many references to the comics.

Then another thing is, take insomniac spider man, are we suppose to believe that he has a relationship with the multiverse as well. So when I’m playing the games i should be thinking that this guy will eventually go to the spider verse? 

It was the same problem when I read the original spider verse comic. It kinda hurts some of the universes if you think about it too much. I remember a lot of people getting mad that (Spoilers) 1970s TV show Spider-Man suddenly got brutally killed and that was now his canon and how his story ends, no thanks.

Although something about the lore and Miguel's motivations bug me and I hope the community can help answer that.

Miguel said Miles wasn't SUPPOSED to be bitten by a spider, and because he was, there was some other universe (we later find out it's Earth 42) where there's no Spiderman.  
But isn't that true for Miles' universe as well if everything had gone to plan? Miles lives in Earth 1610, so if everything had gone to plan, Earth 42 would have had a Spiderman, but not Earth 1610. Why isn't this a problem? Why are the people on Earth 42 more important than those on Earth 1610, that Miles brings this up while berating Miles?

&#x200B;

1. What did Miles do to Miguel to escape from being pinned against the train?
2. Miles snuck into Gwen's portal and eventually ended up at Spidey HQ as a result... why were people acting like this was their ""plan all along"" to keep Miles at HQ?",2023-06-12

"If glitching is now an official thing, why doesn’t Doctor Strange glitch in MOM when he goes to different universes? Kinda makes sense that America doesn’t glitch because of her powers but Doctor Strange should right?",2023-06-12
"So, crazy theory but hear me out…

Miguel is the one who killed Uncle Aaron. I mean, we never actually see Kingpin pull the trigger. This being after they left no ambiguity over him killing Peter Parker. With Miles not originally being part of the Spider-Man canon, killing Uncle Aaron could have been Miguel’s way of course correcting that universe before it could unravel due to Miles breaking its canon and that world’s Spider-Man dying.

Miles being an anomaly who did break his universe by diverging from canon isn’t enough of a reason for Miguel to have kept him away, especially since studying Miles could have lead to them understanding how to break canon and survive. But if Miguel is the reason that world’s canon was “patched”, the guilt he feels toward Miles would be a great reason he never brought him in. We know he’s not above morally grey actions— allowing people to die for the sake of canon. One death to save billions. His overwhelming anger toward Miles makes so much more sense if he’s using it to mask his guilt. To convince himself that HE is the good guy and Miles, by his very existence as an anomaly, is the antagonist. 

But that’s just a theory.",2023-06-12
"Genuine plot question:

If disrupting the canon ends the universe, and taking that Earth-42's was disrupted by Peter Parker never being bitten by his spider since the spider fled to Earth-1610, and Earth-1610's too since its Peter Parker died saving Miles, something that should have never happened, how the hell are both Earths still there? 

If Miles was never meant to be, shouldn't both worlds have ended already? Or was Miguel perhaps wrong, and Miles was meant to be afterall?",2023-06-14

"I made a post about this earlier, but somebody warned me about spoiling the movie, so I would just drop my post here:

Across the spider verse: missing character arc potential?

Across the spider verse was just released in my country, and upon watching it, and even though this thing has been praised to the heavens, I can’t help but feel like the character arc of Spider Gwen was kinda stunted by the plot. I get that the character is supposed to yearn for affection due to loneliness, and yet simultaneously fears it due to her extreme guilt over her killing of her best friend, so she spends the entirety of the movie running away from her father because she believes that she cannot be redeemed in the eyes of others. That is, until she realizes that her father understands her feelings, and that makes her finally understand that she doesn’t have to suffer from fear of affection and guilt, because there’s still people that love her regardless, and it ties in with the movie’s theme of whether Spider-Man needs to suffer or not. I get how each part of these elements are shown and explored in the film, but, for me, something just feel… missing about this plot point? I feel like this character arc could have been better than it is, if we were shown more of her backstory with Peter, stuffs like how Gwen suffered from loneliness but finally finds the affection she needs in Peter, Peter became obsessed with becoming “unique” like her, and finally, her internal dialogue about how she feels guilty for killing Peter. I’m not just talking about how she literally kills him here, but also how she was the reason for Peter decided to turn into the Lizard in the first place. This way her guilt and pain would seem even more excruciating than it is shown in the actual film, and, maybe, could add more depth to the arc and make it more compelling. I’m not saying the arc is bad, in fact I think it is really effective, but I really think it could be way, way better. I don’t know, maybe I’ve just been reading too much Berserk lately, so now my brain is just conditioned into being obsessed with extreme internal drama lol. What do you guys think?",2023-06-28
I wonder how Gwen’s dad not going for captain anymore is going to affect the canon events and what their going to do with Gwen/Mile’s dad. Theyre pretty clear that spiderman can’t do both without breaking canon (Mumbatan spiderman trying to save his girlfriend and the captain would have led to the captain dying) so I wonder if Miles will try to do both and lose both of them or have to choose,2023-06-29

"Amazing movie! But a question I have: So Miguel broke canon or whatever by slipping into his alts life and it seemed like that somehow resulted in that dimension being seemingly deleted? So is that what is happening to Pavitr's universe? Also if that's what happens, why does Gwen ask Miguel if he even knows what would happen if miles broke canon? It seems like he does know and i assume they all know. Is Miles' case gonna be different because he'll be fighting spot somehow?",2023-08-14

"Watched the movie today, another success from the Spiderverse. At first I thought the animation was even more dazzling and over the top compared to the first movie such that it was a sensory overload at first. But once you get into it it works very well. The pace and tension picks up incredibly in the middle and never lets go, it was on the edge of your seat stuff until the end. When you see all the different Spider people/things (looking at you Peter Parkedcar😛), it’s quite absurd but totally fun and brings some levity to a story that has deeply serious themes and a sinister ending with the Spot becoming all powerful and the Miles Morales Prowler turning the heat up on Miles the Spider-Man. Another amazing film and looking forward to the next one.",2023-12-10
"I think it had a lot of things going for it. Inevitably rendering technology gets better, but the cel shading feels more subtle and less overdone. ( lots of spoilers obviously, heads up) 

I feel like the drama scenes were effective, though I don't think it's as progressive as I'd want it to be ( I'm referring to drama progression and not social commentary) - a good dramatic progression is Star Wars A New Hope.. 

Luke wants to attend the Jedi Academy, but his aunt and uncle have essentially prevented him from doing so.  So the ability to detect plans in the R2-D2 droid is what creates dramatic tension because it involves a bigger and more dangerous world.

But back to spider verse part 2, I think the logistical difficulty is that while there was interdimensional TV shows and books and maybe a few movies.. Spiderverse 1 transformed it into a marketable gimmick.

Everyone's not only trying to create their MCU, but tie it with other franchises that they have license to. And so I do think it's a case of something working and working too well. 

But no I don't get less rambly...I believe II feels more thoughtfully put together then part one,  but less entertaining.

And so I do feel like part II feels like it's trying to splinter the plot just so that viewers can't guess it.

""The bracelet allows you to travel to your timeline, but it can only work if the character is Canon and not an accidental spider verse lab anomaly. "" ( I'm spitballing, I didn't read Wikipedia.. did watch the film)

And so I'm not fond of this technique, because it makes it easy for characters to not have to grow ( I'm thinking about Monsters Inc but instead of an overarching plot is just the door-return scene... if something's wrong just go into another door!)

But also you have an audience of eight year olds, so you know just stealing the Doctor Who playbook would shock. (pause) 

I think the Gwen Stacy scenes with her dad work better than the Miles Morales scenes with Mom. Someone who cares more about duty than domestic life would plausibly not handle the reveal than someone who is shown to be well tempered in the earlier scenes.

I'm pretty meh on Miles being able to outrun and out swing the entire city of the Spider-Man. To me it makes the stakes feel smaller than they are.

What I really dislike is Peter B Parker helping Miguel the spider army. I feel like that really undoes the character development he had in the last film. My analogy would be if there were a sequel to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Sean Connery's character still alive but going back to artifact obsession and calling his son Junior all the time.

And maybe nitpick to have is that filmmakers have is trying to make ""don't call me a kid"" into the 'don't call me Junior' of Spider-Man movies.

Also I think the ending should have just been Morales in the wrong timeline with no visible way to get out.  

I think the logical point that is established plot wise is that Gwen think she's knocking a Spider Man villain what she thinks is a safe timeline, but rather what seems to be his own stomping grounds. 

I think the reveal with the evil parallel universe Miles would probably cause quite a reaction for people under 20, but can't help but think of the 60s show The Prisoner, or think of a bajillion Flash stories that involve alternate heroes turned evil.

But I actually am curious about three because I'm trying to think of how they're gonna resolve the Spot.  I feel like he's been both a sympathetic ""incrediboy"" archetype in the film, and a force of nature, but I'd like to see him as someone who is very much a villain and not this Collider 2.0. Nerfed, if you will.

PS. I like the movie.",2023-12-14
"Finally got around to watching this and honestly, I was pretty disappointed. Right off the bat the pacing was terrible. It’s not until halfway through, over and hour into the film, that the multiverse aspect of the story even appears. The whole first hour of the film is just Miles and his parents bickering. The second half was better, but not by much. There just wasn’t much substance to this story, and it seems like they stretched one film’s story into two. 

I also don’t really dig the message of the film. Miles is willing to risk literally every life in the universe just to save his dad. I get it’s a hard choice, but the fact that he doesn’t even seem to consider the consequences makes him come off as incredibly selfish and basically the exact opposite of how a Spiderman or any hero would act. 

I also thought the whole chase sequence with Miles running away from the other Spidermen was kind of dumb. I know it’s a comic book film, but it really strained my suspension of disbelief when literally hundreds of Spidermen couldn’t catch one 15 year old Spiderman. 

Overall, the film just felt kind of hollow, existing mostly to push cameos and easter eggs, and what little substance is there is disappointing.",2024-01-05

The second time was highschool/college kids vaping weed and talking the whole time who got really combative when asked to quiet down.

What was Miguel’s greatest sin? Not super clued up on Spider-Man 2099 so I’m intrigued to know more after watching this?,2023-06-02
"Spider-man is tenacious and never gives up, which makes an incredibly scary antagonist when you're on the wrong end of it.  I like that it's clear Miguel believes what he's doing and seems to have reason to even if the audience if given reason to side against him. 

He's not ""Crazy"" or being ""manipulated"" by the real villain,  he's someone who sees himself fighting to keep a naive kid from killing billions.",2023-06-14
"I’m calling it now, the Miguel we meet killed the alternate version of himself to try to take over his life and have his daughter back and lied about finding a universe where his alt was already dead. That is what caused that world to collapse and he can’t accept it. When Miles stopped the cannon event and the black whole arrived it looked different to Miguel’s memories.   Maybe that really was spot’s influence like miles says it is, and he can save anyone and make his own story.",2023-06-06
I’ve only read some 2099 but I feel like that is Miguel. He’s dark and menacing often. Not to mention incredibly stubborn.,2023-06-03
I liked him and understood his motivations. Getting crazier as they were pushing further into doing the thing that destroyed his soul in the first place.,2023-06-09
"Seriously though! We're all actively trying to make sure people die because they're ""supposed to"" instead of trying to find an alternative solution, yet we're still the good guys. It's honestly baffling how so many Spider variants just went along with all this without question. 

The solution seems kind of straightforward, given Gwen's dad leaving his captain position.  Confiding in those closest to you is what ends up saving them, rather than destroying them as we've been conditioned to expect.",2023-06-10
"I don’t think Miguel is a Spider Man.  A few things were he’s the only spider man that doesn’t shoot webs, he’s the only one that isn’t funny at all, he’s the only one that isn’t all for good, and I think the biggest one is Miles made a comment about spiders not having claws.  My prediction is he was a villain in his universe and his family died, so he went over to a different universe (call back to Kingpin) and killed Miguel of that universe who was Spider Man in his own universe",2023-06-04
"That line by Gwen was my least favorite part of the movie, which I otherwise thought was amazing. Just felt too on the nose and didn’t even really make sense. Makes it seem like a good vs. evil battle when really all of the Spider-People are good, just different versions of it. Miguel is lawful good, Miles is somewhere between neutral and chaotic. And the audience is aware of all of this. Cut Gwen’s line and the scene works just as well",2023-06-03
"I was also a bit confused, was Aaron not Miles canon event? Or are there just multiple?",2023-06-10
[deleted],2023-06-02
He's going to become the final villain in the next movie I think,2023-06-04
Yeah an angry depressed Hispanic I know I'm one of them.,2023-06-24
OMFG LMAOO I REMEMBER HAHA ITHOUGHT MILES DIED,2023-06-02
"That entire scene scared me so much. Felt like watching the prelude to someone about to get tortured. Terrifying.

How does this loving uncle in a children’s movie manage to keep legitimately scaring the shit out of me in two films?????",2023-06-08
I said to myself “invincible be like” imagining if that was actually the scenario,2023-06-05
Dood same!!! I gasped out loud at that part,2023-06-03
"IMMEDIATELY thought of the stylized Borderlands covers, with the bandits shooting their heads with finger guns.",2023-06-08
Bro that was wild. A kid in my theater immediately started crying and it felt like the air got sucked out of the room.,2023-06-14
Which scene are you talking about? Is it where prowler knocks Miles out?,2023-06-07
😆,2023-06-05
Same,2023-06-06
I am sorry did you say children's film ? Because I think that's gonna trigger more people than you think xD,2023-09-03
"Wait, so their job is to jump between dimensions and protect the multiverse…

The tools they use to do that are the wristbands…

He took equipment away from Miguel’s lab and made his own, free from Miguel’s oversight…

Did… did he seize the means of production?!?",2023-06-02
The anarchist Spider-Man cookbook,2023-06-02
"Yep. He dropped his when he quit, so he had to have built the one he made for Gwen himself.",2023-06-04
He’s like Rocket.,2023-06-02
Did he steal that much? He must have made 2: 1 for him and 1 to drop off for Gwen. Didn't realize he nabbed that many items during the walk,2023-06-03
"When the box was handed over to Gwen’s dad and he handed it to her, thought it was a trick from Spot but then I saw the UK flag and realized all is well.",2023-06-04
My fucking god I didn't notice that. That's so awesome.,2023-06-06
"So many connections to so much stuff to both earlier in this movie and the first one.

Spot being the bagel guy.

Prowler-Miles hanging Spider-Miles up like he did to Peter in the first one.

Prowler-Miles saying ""I'm Miles Morales"" in the same tone as the college lady at the start.

The ""Universe 42"" actually being on the display when Miles escapes, ruining a bit of the Twist for people who notice.",2023-06-27
I feel like he might be the one to be revealed as the bad guy in the next movie. As in earth >!616- Hobbie Brown is the OG Prowler!<,2023-06-15
"Yeah, that's what I picked up on clearly in my second viewing.  Hobie isn't just a cool aloof dude.  He's constantly pushing Miles toward opposition, stealing shit, working against the Spider Society.  You just don't notice it until the end because he's cooler without his mask on.  


>I was this cool the whole time

\-Hobie

oh, damn, sorry mate.",2023-06-27
"""Palms"" was such a hype moment",2023-08-25
"I live in India, so this scene was particularly appreciated in my theatre",2023-06-04
The traffic line was hilarious considering both NYC and Mumbai are known for their clogged roads,2023-06-04
That was brilliant writing! That sequence was one of my favorites but it’s so hard to really pick one because it was all so good and flowed so well!,2023-06-03
Man I thought that's what he said but it was such a quiet line I couldn't tell for sure and no one else laughed so I thought I'd misheard.,2023-06-03
banger line but we're in britain so idk how many of my audience appreciated it,2023-06-02
"The whole Mumbattan sequence was so good. The dialogue was funny as hell, the cityscape and little details were *gorgeous*.",2023-06-26
I wasn't expecting that at all. I was dying.,2023-06-10
"Pointing with his middle fingers, too.",2023-06-19
Haha I died at that one haha,2023-10-10
just reminds you of how many spiderman villains they showed us in homecoming and then never did anything with. off the top of my head they also showed shocker and scorpion,2023-06-02
I didn't expect any of the live action bits. I thought it would only be different animation styles but they incorporated live action as well.,2023-06-02
it’s such a dope cameo considering that ep in community with gloved wearing the spider-man suit is part of the inspiration for miles as a character,2023-06-03
I thought maybe it would be a voice cameo since it was announced he would have a part somewhere in this movie. Live action was crazy,2023-06-02
So is the implication here is that he was in the wrong universe (MCU) and he was captured to be transported to his SONY universe for their rumored Miles Morales solo film?,2023-06-03
I would pay a lot to see Glover as Prowler in a full movie.  Make the next Tom Holland one or if they ever do another Garfield,2023-06-03
Donald Glover as Prowler was great foreshadowing to Miles being the Prowler,2023-06-03
"Donald glover had a cameo as a criminal that Tom Holland spiderman sticks to his car and interrogates. He even gives him advice on doing a better job. Then ends up as prowler in a other universe? Maybe that spiderman averted his character from becoming prowler, or guaranteed it because homie was looking for alien tech.",2023-06-19
Oh my god I didn't realize that. That's so cute!,2023-06-02
T-WHIP might be the best sight gag in the entire movie. I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.,2023-06-03
"Also when the film first starts there's a ""CRUNCH"" action word (or a word along those lines anyway) in the bottom right-hand corner or the screen, as if the sound is coming from the audience. Brilliant.",2023-06-05
And then shortly after when cowboy Spiderman shot his gun it was “thwang”,2023-06-06
My gf thought that was the best part of the movie and honestly I agree,2023-06-08
This actually destroyed me in theaters,2023-06-14
"I was at the movie with my mum and she let out an audible ""oh my God"" when Spider-Rex showed up.",2023-06-27
"The Spot's art style reminds me of the henchmen from the video game *Toonstruck*: Feedback, Goggles, and Lugnut.",2023-06-02
I noticed it on a miguel too! Maybe to show how villainous and transparent they are?,2023-06-02
"I saw it as he wasn't 'finished' yet, so still had sketch lines",2023-06-07
The first thing that I noticed with him and that I super really liked was how you can see the structural sketch lines through him,2023-07-01
*was,2023-06-04
"When the balloon dog got cut open and it was filled with smaller balloon dogs - ""oh neat""",2023-06-02
I also liked how Miles’ Dad did the same walking down the stairs gag as Miles did when he tried to do a Leap of Faith.,2023-06-04
Post Malone is a multiversal constant.,2023-06-02
Miles’ roommate was also playing the video game,2023-06-04
"Not just The Spot but the entire ending scene with Uncle Aaron legit felt like a torture snuff room or something. I know they wouldn’t do that and Aaron probably wouldn’t ever consider torturing even an alternate version of his nephew… But damn that entire scene gave me chills.

Especially when he started turning up the chill music over Miles’ begging. That man has *for sure* tortured people.

That scene really scared me.",2023-06-08
"> It's fucking insane how dark this movie feels for a pg movie,

Yeah, because this movie actually *earns* its PG rating instead of getting hit with one over a fart or poop joke.",2023-06-04
its the exact same one too!,2023-06-03
"That Banksy callback was a miss for me. The helicopter just landed in the webs and people on the ground were nearly crushed by it, the fact that someone would just comment that it's probably a Banksy, instead of just running for their lives was ridiculous.",2023-06-12
That one doesn't make as much sense given all the ongoing actions and explosions.,2023-06-08
Yeah for a second but they really showed it twice which was surprising,2023-06-05
When the spot started getting really powerful I got big Mr Bloom from DC vibes from him just the way he moved,2023-06-15
Wonder if we’ll see insomniac miles lol,2023-06-16
"The animation for Apocalyptic Spot is fantastic, now just hope they can match the expectation of his powers.",2023-06-19
Where was he?,2023-06-05
"Thrice, even! The normal one walking around in the background, a female version in another shot and then Genki playing the upcoming game somehow.",2023-06-27
Pretty sure I quantum fractured & now exist in multiple timelines simultaneously.  Got out of my screening six hours ago & I'm still buzzing.,2023-06-02
There were parts i genuinely was sitting with my chin in my hands in awe of what i was seeing,2023-06-04
Deadass. Next viewing im definitely taking shrooms.,2023-06-02
Genuinely. I think i have spider-withdrawal now. What an experience.,2023-06-04
especially during the last segment when he went to Earth 42,2023-06-03
"Same - I needed a minute before I drove home afterwards, in broad daylight mind you.",2023-06-05
Especially during that last half hour. Just got back from the theatre. Man this movie looks incredible on the big screen,2023-06-07
"Sammmeee, I could have sworn I astral projected and then died then came back to life at the cliffhanger",2023-06-06
I went to India and found myself,2023-07-18
Same brother.,2023-06-04
When Peni showed up briefly I thought that was all we would get from the original squad. But that shot of everyone gathered at the end? Goosebumps.,2023-06-02
I was so unbelievably happy to see them both at the end. This movie was sorely missing Spider-Man Noir in particular and I really can't wait to see him get a hopefully expanded role in the sequel.,2023-06-02
so hyped for nicolas cage's return,2023-06-02
"I love that Nic Cage said he wouldn’t be voicing Noir in the movie, but left it at that. Gotta be returning for BTSV.",2023-06-03
I just want to see the sub plot with Noir and his Rubric Cube be completed.,2023-06-02
I was waiting for a mulaney intervention reference in the Spidey HQ,2023-06-02
"When I saw Peni turn up it was all I could do to not beg for more Peni. She's adorable and I loved her in Into the Spider-verse. Sad we didn't get much of her but hoping to see more of her in Beyond, since she was in that final group shot!",2023-06-06
The Spot is Noir's cousin,2023-06-03
I freaked out when I saw Spider-Ham!,2023-06-04

"Welcome to Gboard clipboard, any text you copy will be saved here.Welcome to Gboard clipboard, any text you copy will be saved here.",2023-07-06
Did anyone else find it real difficult to understand him? Not the accent but more is voice levels were very low.,2023-06-02
"british spiderman from the ends of camden town

was def not on the bingo card

but MY GOD IT WORKEDD

Daniel Kaluuya take a bow !!",2023-06-02
"I thought he was okay. 

Then I saw how he helped Miles on how to escape using his electricity and the full palm and made me like him.

And then when Miguel sends him away and he said that he quit.

That's when I loved him.

I knew he would be back for the story.",2023-06-02
coolest dude in every room,2023-06-02
"I laughed out loud at ""What's that?! [At the spot portal thing] // It's a metaphor for capitalism."".

His anti-authority/capitalism, hint-of-nihilism schtick was so brilliant!",2023-06-06
"My theater had zero reactions towards Spider Punk while my friends and I were practically his only fans there laughing at every time he spoke. Instead, the theater was packed with young Indian-Americans who loved and freaked out at the Mumbai scene and made that entire segment for me",2023-06-03
"I have become such a Spider-Punk fan after this lol.

He really did stick it to the man",2023-06-03
"I was so ready to hate him when he seemed like he would be the romantic false lead. In the end, I wanted to watch an entire Spider-Punk movie.",2023-06-04
“I officially quit”,2023-06-03
"The little bit of her putting her hair up before walking around the edge of the building was a nice  bit, too.",2023-06-02
I was grinning ear to ear every time Miles and Gwen had their little moments. The amount of chemistry these two fictional animated characters have just oozes off the screen,2023-06-02
"Going upside down worked wonders during Miles' leap of faith in the first movie, and it sure as hell worked here. Wallpaper material.",2023-06-02
"It's really hard to genuinely create a ""teen love"" scenario, but they pulled it off 100% relatable.",2023-06-02
"It was just stunning. 

There was so much of the view to take in with them along with pitch perfect character writing. 

Didn’t want it to end.",2023-06-02
"Weirdly, considering how the shot is framed and the fact that film is animated, that somehow set off my vertigo - which never happens in films, like it was beautifully animated but gave me a sensation that I was about to fall.",2023-06-02
A lot of times I’m too invested in the story and action of a movie the first time around to truly see how stunning some shots are until I go back and watch it but this is honestly one of the first times I sat there in the moment and went *holy shit*,2023-06-02
It was gorgeous.,2023-06-02
"loved the movie slowing down and having two characters just talk to each other, seeing mj and peter happy together is so nice",2023-06-02
Saw this in IMAX.  It was incredible.  Miles and Gwen were tiny specs against this massive backdrop,2023-06-03
The whole world is upside down but at least we have each other.,2023-06-02
"That imagery evoked a reflection of a city in a lake at sunrise/sunset, which was gorgeous.",2023-06-02
"It's one of my favorite scenes as well.

[removed],2023-06-03
I told my husband I need that as a poster immediately  I don’t know where is put it tho,2023-06-03
"I liked that we saw both angles, with the city right side up and them upside-down, and then flipped.",2023-06-04
"I kinda wish instead of falling into his shoulder, she kinda swung into it, to fit the physics.",2023-06-04
Whole scene is pretty much one big opportunity for a framed painting and/or a desktop wallpaper/screensaver. Just absolutely gorgeous film from a visual standpoint.,2023-06-04
The soundtrack overall but especially during that scene was so awesome,2023-06-04
The transition of when she walked off the ledge to upside down was so smooth too.,2023-06-07
"You know, this implied that their asses are what made them stick onto the building upside down.",2023-06-04
What a great reference to the Tobey Maguire/Kirsten Dunst scene,2023-06-17
I was telling my friend the same thing! I want a poster of this now,2023-06-13
I had weird sense of vertigo seeing the NYC skyline top of frame while the characters were... 'normal',2023-06-26
Planning to print that one in my room. Spectacular view. Both of them sitting in that tower clock while the city buildings are upside down.,2023-08-15
"idk if it was me, but i feel like alt miles had a slightly stronger accent? which kinda made sense because his dad wasn’t around so it’s more spanish with his mom",2023-06-03
What about exaggerated swagger?,2023-06-02
"Bruh, his braids was ***too*** clean",2023-06-02
"Idk how they were able to do this but, somewhere in my gut, I just knew it was Jharrel Jerome as that miles, and when I looked it up, it was indeed him!! That means two Moonlight Actors, Jharrel Jerome and Mahershala Ali share a scene together in this film.",2023-06-02
Ai we’re they black? I thought they were blue,2023-06-02
Not gonna lie: he scared the shit out of me. I forgot it he was ANIMATED AND NOT REAL,2023-06-03
Were those legit black Air Force ones? I'm trying to figure out what shoes those were. Any idea?,2023-06-02
Who Ja Morant thinks he is,2023-06-05
A lot of people missed your cultural reference.,2023-06-03
Thought they were purple tbh,2023-06-02
"I think he’s a good guy/resistance fighter, in a world with no Spider-Man the Sinister Six have taken over. The way 42 Uncle Aaron says “bad guy” in reaction to Miles saying it, I dunno, feels like it’s a big red herring.",2023-06-18
He definitely had the exaggerated swagger of a black teen - IGN 😎,2023-06-04
Bully Morales,2023-06-10

Major facts,2023-06-02
if you know you know,2023-06-05
Darkest timeline miles morales,2023-06-09
He was kinda giving mumble rapper vibes. It was cool hearing him speak from his moms influence though.,2023-06-07
Seeing miles 1610 and miles 42 reminded me of huey and Riley from boondocks,2023-06-18
He appears near the start of the movie too. During Spots introduction to Miles.,2023-06-13
I hope we see him with black forces next movie in the same vein of our Miles Chicago 1s.,2023-06-11
I ALSO thought that!  i was expecting it to be waayyyyy longer...,2023-06-02
"I was waiting for a post-credits scene, and I was surprised how quickly the credits went by too.",2023-06-02
It’s because they went with a slideshow looking credits instead of the usual scrolling credits in most movies. Bumblebee also had slideshow credits and it finishes up quickly too.,2023-06-02
Crew was over 1000+ people which is a lot for an animated project. Someone below already said it but the slideshow credits made it much faster. I had a few friends working on it and I didn’t have time to find their names.,2023-06-02
Probably as a way for people to not get mad at the lack of stinger. But it felt so weird how short they were considering how long they were in the last one.,2023-06-02
"The movie's budget was ""only"" $100M, which I thought was surprisingly small, which could explain the smaller number of crew involved. Contrast that with Pixar's Elemental, which has double the budget and a half hour shorter run time. No doubt its crew was much larger.",2023-06-04
They were setting up a sequel… The credits will be continued in Beyond the Spider-Verse!,2023-06-03
Really feel for all the theater folks that will have to do the “there’s no post credit scene and we need to clean the theater” announcements this month,2023-06-04
"It pobably helps keep such a stylistically complicated movie visually consistent if they have a relatively small team as opposed to multiple teams across different countries. Plus, they probably figured out a lot of the production pipeline while making the first one",2023-06-02
Love how they included production babies too,2023-06-12
"They didn't scroll the credits, maybe that's why",2023-06-04
Well I remember them being 3 or 4 screens with multiple columns and lots of rows just for Animators credits. I estimate near 200 animators credited,2023-06-08
Large numbers of staff != good. Look at any recent MCU movies. The list is long and many of them are people from VFX mills in low-labor-cost countries.,2023-06-02
Scrolled through the cast and crew waaay too fast,2023-06-04
I loved how they weren't scrolling credits. More movies should do that,2023-06-08
Yeah that's because they used gpt to make the movie /s,2023-06-08
you didnt see the making off for the first one did you ? the trained AI this time.,2023-06-03
Thats generally how it is for inhouse animated stuff. It was basically just one studio working on this,2023-06-06
"Yeah but the credits animation was also gorgeous, so there's that.",2023-06-26
I also enjoyed his remark about having a museum for all the artifacts England stole.,2023-06-02
"""dont eat, pray, love me bro""",2023-06-02
"Could definitely be a ref to the Darjeeling Ltd, but I took it as more of a joke about a lot of westerners going to south and SE Asia to ""find themselves"" - might be less of a thing in the US, but its absolutely rife among young upper and upper-middle class white kids in the UK",2023-06-02
"His quip where he's like ""and this is where the British stole all our stuff!"" had me cackling, but I was the only one in my theater to laugh.

I wish we got more of him in the movie, he was a fun character",2023-06-02
And the chai + tea redundancy also aligns with miles asking spot earlier why he says atm + machine,2023-06-02
The connection is definitely there but I took it more as a joke about westerners doing exactly this.,2023-06-02
HAH! I didn’t make this connection. That’s great,2023-06-02
I also loved the Chai tea and Naan bread jokes,2023-06-03
Can't wait for Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson to show up in the sequel,2023-06-02
Oh shit. I just got it.,2023-06-02
I just watched The Darjeeling Limited for the first time recently so I made that connection a bit but didn’t realize Shwartzman did the voice of the villain. How great lol.,2023-06-02
The Chai tea annoyances cracked me up.,2023-06-03
"Man I thought Jason Schwartzman‘s performance was so fucking funny. His intonations during his lines were just great. I feel like after Scott Pilgrim, he really nails the nerdy, villain drunk with power.",2023-06-16
Two of my Indian friends laughed their asses off during the chai and naan rant. It mirrored their own rants perfectly.,2023-06-05
OH! Spot is G-Man Graves!!!,2023-06-07
I was thinking more on the line where he gets upset about Chai being called Chai Tea,2023-06-03
Lmao the “I love chi tea” I love Jason Schwartzman,2023-06-09
i’m genuinely so proud of myself for getting that reference immediately haha,2023-06-04
I'm just sad I don't have anyone to share this reference with,2023-06-05
It’s also funny cause Jason Schwartzman was in the Darjeeling limited which he also goes to India lol,2023-06-04
when british people watch movie oof,2023-06-02
Where was the schwatzman joke,2023-06-11
It took me a moment to make the connections that Jason Schwartzmann voices Spot,2023-06-19
In Miles' universe Morbius is an unironically beloved movie series probably,2023-06-02
***Miles in Morbius 2 = CONFIRMED***,2023-06-02
Morbes Morales? Miles Morbales?,2023-06-02

It ended at the midpoint right into the rising action towards the climax. It made me feel like I was watching a great movie that got shutoff half-way through, and I left the theatre feeling empty, there was no payoff. 

I wish it'd have ended on a bigger punch, like having the final fight happen between the spider teams, and then have them struggle against the spot while miles is held captive in another universe. Maybe Gwen tries and fails to save Mile's dad in the resulting destruction, and the spot breaks the multiverse right as the screen cuts off.

This one did not. The journey itself was pretty fantastic, I laughed a lot and the artistry was mind-blowingly good. The amount of creativity they can do with this series is just off the charts.

I think this might be the most creative use of animation ever. I've seen other anime use shifting styles before, but it always feels kind of like it pulls me out. This used shifting animation to tell the story. Gwen's last moment with her dad could have been told entirely without the character models, just voice over and the background color.

>I’m finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable. No joke.   


That's because there's nothing even close.  


There are a lot of animated films which I'd strongly rate for their art style - The Iron Giant, Rango, Waltz with Bashir, Persepolis, Soul, The Lego Movies, Mitchells vs the Machines. Some series too - e.g. BoJack Horseman, Love Death & Robots. And there are some animations which were probably more influential (most notably Toy Story).  

But all of those were technically impressive or innovative in one, or perhaps two, ways (or in the case of Love Death and Robots, one or two per episode).  

The original Spider-Verse film was pretty unique in the extent to such it successfully innovated - it had the variable frame rate thing, the shading style, the comic book inserts, the tactical use of colour and alternative styles, as well as absolutely incredible art direction and cinematography.  

And then that team decide that for the sequel they're going to do the same thing but instead of one jawdropping artstyle they're going to create four (Gwenverse, Milesverse, Mumbai, Nuevo York), and layer in a whole bunch of extra ones situationally (Da Vinci, the Spot's visions, the Spot himself, Punk, verse 42). As well as animating literally hundreds of distinct artstyles for various supporting characters.  

It's shockingly ambitious. The first film was already out in front of the competition, and this exceeds it in just about every way.",2023-06-04
"Mind Game (2004) and Redline (2009) have some absolutely gorgeous, incredibly unique, and certainly stylized animation. I'd check them out. 

Edit: Akira (1988) is a mandatory watch and if you are into it Fantastic Planet (1973) is gorgeous",2023-06-02
">finding it hard to find anything remotely comparable. No joke.

I'd say Arcane is just as good in animation. Not as creative though since it maintains a consistent art style most of the time.",2023-06-05

A pause, and then the window breaks, glass scatters freezing in slo-mo. A moment later, ""They fit perfectly.""

Every single shot in that sequence is burned into my brain.  

The sequel isn't quite as good a film, in my opinion.  It's outstanding, but has a lot on its plate.  Too much to do.  That it didn't feel overstuffed is a minor miracle.  The creative team really threaded a needle here.  

The art team looked at a needle, threaded it, used it to sew leather on a baseball, and then knocked said baseball off the fucking planet.

Can’t ignore the sound design which was just as good,2023-06-04
"The movie has such a unique visual style, and then on top of that they manage to create a unique style for the different worlds to set them apart.",2023-06-04
I LITERALLY SAID THE SAME THING TO MY FRIENDS IN THE THEATRE. Every frame is a piece of art. Freeze frame whenever you want.,2023-06-11
"I didn't think they could match the quality of the first movie but that was sheer bias because that became one of my favorite movies ever instantly.

This one though....this one blew me away even more. I cannot wait for Beyond.",2023-06-26
They really stepped up their game. Every Gwen scene was unbelievable,2023-07-04
Ah but he isn’t JJJ in Spider-Man PlayStation :(,2023-06-02
"i personally thought that spot gonna stop at the end and that ""bad"" spiderman gonna go for kill himself but now i dont know anything anymore and i love that)",2024-04-04
Was it though? I feel like in one universe it was the Jonah from the Insomniac Spider-Man games.,2023-06-02
So worth seeing on the Samsung onyx led screen. Colors and blacks were an amazing visual treat,2023-06-03
I was just sad we couldn't get Ed Asner's JJJ in a sound clip :(,2023-06-04
"Genuinely! Completely agree. If they 'stick the landing' for beyond, this belongs in the pantheon along Star Wars IV-V-VI, LoTR, Nolan's Batman, Indiana Jones.",2023-06-06
">I love how the one constant in the Spiderverse is apparently JK Simmons is always J Jonah Jameson.

That Invincible universe is pretty wild.",2023-06-08
Well jk Simmons isn’t a constant cuz he isn’t in insomniac Spider-Man’s universe,2023-06-10
"> I love how the one constant in the Spiderverse is apparently JK Simmons is always J Jonah Jameson.

*It's canon.*",2023-06-14
"> then this will be one of best trilogies of all time.

If not the best",2023-06-17
">If Beyond can keep this momentum, and I see little reason why it wouldn't, then this will be one of best trilogies of all time. 

What competition does it have? I can think of The Godfather, Lord of the Rings, and the Star Wars original trilogy. Is the Matrix considered one of the best trilogies of all time, or do people usually consider the 2nd and 3rd movie worse than the 1st?",2023-06-19
Those Gwen/Dad scenes were a testament to the emotional power of color. Stunning. My favorite parts of the film.,2023-06-02
"The background changing to suit their moods was oomf, beautiful",2023-06-02
The parts from her perspective reminded me a little of Life is Strange,2023-06-02
"Legitimately blown away by the Gwen dad conversations. Every frame was expressive and indicative of the feelings. 

Him quitting and her realization warming up the colors in the Scene. Goddamn.",2023-06-02
"I love many animated movies, but I've never seen an animated movie go so beautifully off the rails as this one; everything (characters, multiverses, etc.) is simultaneously distinct, unified, fluid, and rock solid. It makes every other movie I've seen that uses the background to telegraph and enhance story beats look like amateur hour.

I know vert little about animation, but I have plenty of experience in long-term project management, and how in the ever-loving *fuck* is something that was worked on by a small army of animators as visually playful as a Don Hertzfeldt short film and *still make narrative sense*?!

I honestly prefer *Into the Spider-Verse*, and it could never match the ""this changes everything"" feeling so many of us got walking out of it, but they somehow took one of the most joyfully liberated visual achievements I've ever seen and leveled up.",2023-06-02
"Don't want to be this asshole, but I'm gonna: it wasn't watercolor, it was pastel chalk, and it was fucking everything to me.",2023-06-02
Bro it literally looked exactly like the art in her comics. It was so satisfying to see that,2023-06-02
Every scene Gwen's dad is in is nothing short of sublime.,2023-06-02
"The environment was so fucking brilliant

By far the best animation i've ever seen in a film",2023-06-02
"The use of color in those scenes was amazing.

This movie was beautiful. Straight up.  Beautiful to look at, beautiful characters, beautiful writing.",2023-06-02
Every scene of Gwen talking to her father was GORGEOUS!,2023-06-02
The whole prologue with Gwen is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. It's actually a perfect short film.,2023-06-02
"The way color tones were changing as emotions were developing to suit the scene was fucking beautiful. Just. Beautiful. This movie was absolutely mindblowing from a visual standpoint, might be one of the most beautiful I've seen.",2023-06-02
When she walks into the apartment she’s upset and is literally a shade of blue. It’s quick but is a really effective piece of visual storytelling. So much of Gwen and her dad’s scenes were just phenomenal visual storytelling,2023-06-03
My son (8) noticed this in the theatre and asked if the room is crying because she's sad.,2023-06-04
"Then when they finally come to terms towards the end 
They get their outlines back, like they’ve started to gather themselves back up.",2023-06-02
The colors were running like tears. It was an amazing emotional touch and an artistic feat.,2023-06-02
"Can we just get her *Spider-woman* movie, please? Please?",2023-06-02
The colors cried when the characters couldn't,2023-06-05
"The conversation with her father had my jaw on the fucking floor.  It was gorgeously animated.  

The art direction in this film was absolutely stellar and I don't think there was a frame in the entire thing that wasn't dripping with style.

They somehow managed to one up the incredibly high bar that was the first one.",2023-06-03
Her BGM was so amazing!,2023-06-02
"I really loved at the beginning how she and her room were designed using cold colors while her dad and the rest of the house was warm, really made the two feel out-of-place with each other and felt so much more rewarding when they resolved their differences",2023-06-03
"And in the later scene the color starts to run down the walls. It’s so well done.

In the scene with Miles telling his mom about being spider-man the world starts to lose focus and blending in more like the water colors in Gwen’s world as Miles figures out he’s out of place. Thought it was a great way to show the characters not connecting with the world around them.",2023-06-04
It really reminded me of Disco Elysium.,2023-06-02
Those were the color pallets from her comic book series. That world was specifically ripped from the comics,2023-06-03
"The use of colour was amazing throughout.

Biggest moment for me, was when he returns to ""his"" bedroom, and rapidly dresses to hide his costume from his mum - in Prowlers colours.",2023-06-07
"That scene was visually jaw-dropping, which is insane for just a heartfelt conversation",2023-06-02
I adored Gwen's universe. Such a beautiful yet effective design.,2023-06-02
Yeah! Those scenes looked ripped straight from the Spider-Gwen comic art. It was incredible,2023-06-02
Pulled straight from her comic covers. It was incredible,2023-06-02
"Along with whatever they did to pull off the design for Spider-Punk, what they did with Gwen's world was one of my favorite visual things I've seen with animation in years.

Such a beautiful movie.",2023-06-05
"Those moments might have been my favorite animation wise. They aren't as flashy as like everything about spiderpunk, but it was pretty beautiful.",2023-06-03
[It's pulled straight from her original solo run. The story is so-so but the art is absolutely gorgeous in every panel.](https://i.imgur.com/SsdlSpG.jpg),2023-06-10
"It was pretty spot on regarding her comics, loved it",2023-06-03
"The use of colour was amazing throughout.

Biggest moment for me, was when he returns to ""his"" bedroom, and rapidly dresses to hide his costume from his mum - in Prowlers colours.",2023-06-07
"I saw it as her emotions and how they matched it. Her dad is always depicted in bright colours, inviting and warm, whereas everything Gwen is in is in dark colours. She feels isolated from her world and her dad, wanting nothing more than to go there but feeling like she can't. 

The moment she hugs her dad and the colour bleeds together was so cathartic because she finally gets out of that isolation and into the warmth and love she deserves and always had.

Also the scene with her dad at the start was so good, where you can tell just from the colours where her dad's mental state is in, struggling between being with his daughter (sharing the red she's in) and the justice side of him (black and white blocks). Then when he finally tries to arrest her, he's in all black and white, fully succumbing. 

The use of color in this movie is second to none, so much just captured through that.",2023-06-22
"The art style really grew on me during the dad reunion scene at the end, but man did the first few minutes not land with me & my wife. 

We both were like ""hmm, I hope we get back to the more *animated* style soon"".",2023-06-02
It's also very reminiscent of the art style of her comics!,2023-06-02
"Depression and inner struggling metaphor, so good",2023-06-05
The scene where Gwen hugged her dad reminded so much of the game Gris,2023-06-08
Absolutely. Masterful animation here. I felt all the anguish between them.,2023-06-03
My first thought was the dripping colours were like tears.,2023-06-04
Love how they use Spider-Gwen comics art style for her.,2023-06-04
Yes! It’s just like her comic!,2023-06-04
"Yea when things got emotional, the walls become very water colored and minimalist. Amazing touch by the artists.",2023-06-05
Its bases off her comic art work,2023-06-05
Yes that was beautiful!,2023-06-05
It was like seeing the comic run of Spider Gwen on screen,2023-06-08
Felt like I was on acid during that scene,2023-06-10
It's robbies stuff from his run,2023-06-02
It was more impressionist than watercolour I thought,2023-06-02
I accidentally read villain when you said civilian and was like wtf did I miss in this movie,2023-06-06
Just looked like mood coloring to me,2023-06-07
The artwork in her universe was just sublime,2023-06-11
"God, the visuals and way the scenery told its own stories was mind blowing.",2023-06-26
Ya I love how much these films experiment with animation in film.,2023-07-21
The guy straight up was thin blue lined when he tried to arrest her,2023-08-08
"i liked that her world has no identifying features or sharp images, its all just a splash of warm, pastel colors and the focal point is always around her and everything else is out of focus or blurred most likely signifying her loneliness and her need for friendship. the attention to detail these animators are giving this movie continues to impress.",2023-08-08
I am convinced that the scriptwriter wrote in 'Mayday is a miracle baby' as a line because it's a miracle that a parker is allowed to be happy,2023-06-02
"In the center of a display of vital Canon Events you have Peter B marrying MJ

Someone knew what they were doing",2023-06-02
"I think the sad and lonely status quo is, well kinda obviously dumb, but more the point in the context of the movie is that you can't focus on what you lose, because you have to focus on what you can create. Peter B Parker focuses on a new family and the relationships that matter. 

I wonder if we'll get something along the lines in the sequel is ""With great power comes great responsibility, but don't forget you also have a responsibility to yourself.""",2023-06-02
An eldritch horror*** plot hole,2023-06-02
I hope Spot still gets to talk in the sequel and isn't just a humanoid black hole,2023-06-02
Peter B is only happy because of an anomaly (Miles),2023-06-02
">Having a central villain being a literal plot hole threatening Spider-Man canon is both hilarious and genius

I kinda got the sense that the writers were giving a big fat middle finger to 'Simpsons Comic Book Guy' types who think any deviation from the source material renders an adaptation obligatorily bad.",2023-06-03
Im convinced that the little girl his dad wants to save will be peters daughter,2023-06-03
Just wait until mephisto shows up in part 3 to make peter b a deal.,2023-06-02
Maybe they use this trilogy as an excuse to finally undo One More Day.,2023-06-03
oh wow he is the plot hole haha,2023-06-02
"> unless they're Peter B. and impacted by Miles

I think this is foreshadowing. Miles is the anomaly and the only one that can break the curse",2023-06-04
I thought that was the worst part of the movie. The main lesson Spider-people learn from their loss is that they can't save everyone but they still have to try and then to have thoundsands of spiders who have given up on that concept and have accepted that there are people they won't try to save is just too far off brand.,2023-06-07
Are they doomed to be sad and lonely? Or just to experience trauma in his life? I don't think those are the same thing.,2023-06-05
It's definitely a great meta movie. Very aware of its own writing process.,2023-06-07
"Wouldn’t say they’re doomed to be lonely. Just with uncle Ben or someone close to them dead. Peter in MCU got the worse of it tho but Uncle Ben, Tony, and Aunt Mae are gone.",2023-06-03
I would love to see it take a dark turn (not that dark). Miles shouldn’t exist so Peter B’s daughter is an anomaly making her a target for 2099. Forcing B to go all out.,2023-06-04
Ob wow. Now that you mention it. Miles can have an impact on everyone so they would not be miserable anymore. See Indian Spidey for example.,2023-06-04
"The whole movie feels like a takedown on grimdark, edgy, pro-utilitarian writing. I think it's trying to make a point that spiderman is best as a light-hearted coming of age story.",2023-06-07
"They went for the jugular with that tbh

Marvel has literally just done the whole time-cuck storyline with Peter, and then ATSV dunks on editorial’s need To make Pete miserable",2023-06-07
"Same. I really liked how the movie was a meta commentary on how Spider-Man needs to be miserable to be Spider-Man. 

""NO! HE CANNOT BE HAPPY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! PEOPLE AROUND HIM NEED TO DIE""

Makes me aaaaaalll kinds of worried about middle aged Peter's Mayday and MJ.",2023-06-08
So then is Miles enacting change? Is he allowing the spidermen he touches to become happy and break the cycle?,2023-06-05
"I think that’s done on purpose. Maybe Peter B Parker will show Miguel and the other spider people that if it wasn’t for Miles, he wouldn’t be where he is and as happy as he is and that Mile’s influence can actually save the other spider people from being fated to live sad and lonely superhero lives. That he does belong as Spider-Man",2023-06-10
"I feel like I’m in the minority for not entirely loving the movie. Correct me at any point, but they are mad with Miles for saving dude on bridge, because it’s the canon for that spidey’s universe. But.. those events leading to the bridge only transpired because of spot coming through from Miles’s original anomaly. Unless they were deliberately making real plot holes with him, or it’s possible I totally missed something?


All these varying responses is why I didn’t like the movie. They weren’t clear about it, whether that was on purpose or not, felt like the pacing was rough the whole movie, especially the very abrupt ending and Jacked audio, I miss 90% of hobie’s dialogue",2023-06-02
"Also I just had a massive realisation, the Elite spider uh... Miguel team thingy right? They all want Miles to just let his dad die... 

Which is just like how Peter originally ""he blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief""

He let it happen and this indifference is what catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben causing him to take being Spider-Man seriously...",2023-06-08
I truly enjoyed seeing Scarlet Spider animated.  I was expecting just a tiny background cameo but he was in several scenes near the end.  Trash ass 90s stories but one of my favorite Spider-man costumes.,2023-06-02
"The ""Ok dad 🙄"" response to Miguel LMAO",2023-06-02
Heroes need to observe when walls are still there.,2023-06-02
Love love love that they made him brooding sad boy. Him and Miguel had the 90’s edge as a throwback to their era in comics.,2023-06-02
"I didnt get his character, can you ELI5?",2023-06-02
Ahhh my painful memories!!!,2023-06-02
"Did they even give Andy Samberg a script or did they just stick him in front of a microphone and say “ok, go”? Lol",2023-06-03
He was also voiced by Adam Samberg. I knew his voice was familiar but boy it's freaking Adam Samberg haha.,2023-06-02
Andy Samberg did a wonderful job voicing that character!,2023-06-03
"Yeah, I thought he was just going to be in there for a one off joke when we first saw him, but then he kept being in the movie, scene after scene. It made me so happy.",2023-06-07
Bro went from funny soft spoken Jason Schwartzman to straight up an Eldritch monstrosity at the end.,2023-06-02
It was cool seeing him improve his powers. From struggling to break into an ATM and tripping on himself to casually warping the scientists out of the collider control room.,2023-06-02
Did you spot spot?,2023-06-03
"Miguel isn't really a villain, but more of a victim. 
That injection that he took during one scene in the movie, either makes me think he's controlling venom (unlikely), or that he's secretly suppressing the lizard from coming out",2023-06-06
"It's not a villain origin story, but a super-villain origin story",2023-07-03
"This must be a GREAT movie for parents, tbh.

Probably the most real they've been portrayed in a superhero movie as well-meaning but overbearing folks.",2023-06-02
"Lol I saw it with a buddy of mine who has a Mexican mom and black dad. 

He laughed the loudest at the B in Spanish mom immediately starts speaking Spanish joke.",2023-06-02
Mama Morales and Gwen is best girl,2023-06-02
"She made me tear up

God I care about Miles’ family so much",2023-06-02
"That speech got me and the random dad sitting next to me the same. No idea who that man was but we were both a crying mess. 

It felt so genuine and felt like the same stuff that my mom struggled to tell me growing up. It stemmed from anxiety but was full of love and trust in the end. One of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.",2023-06-02
"My father leaned over after her speech to Miles and whispered,  
""Everything she just said, I want to reiterate it for you.""",2023-06-02
You used her first name,2023-06-02
"I started tearing up at that speech, hit hard and felt really real.",2023-06-02
"That speech hit me on so many different levels. Growing up and navigating the world as I’ve worked my way through my education and profession, often one of few persons of color in the room, I wish I had someone like her giving me advice and the reassurance to be confident. I recently found out I’ll be be having a kid (funny enough I’m Rican and my girl black too) so it had me thinking of the lessons I’ll be teaching them one day. Obv the film was super fun and visually amazing but it was those human moments that really stuck out to me.",2023-06-03
I'm a father of a 6 months lil girl and if I had watched this last year it wouldn't mean as much as it did tonight to me.,2023-06-03
That whole conversation emotionally killed me. God damn,2023-06-02
"She said she worried she wouldn't always be around to make him feel like he belonged.

Ten minutes later and Miguel is yelling ""You don't belong here!""",2023-06-03
"One of the main things I wanted to see was Miles' relationship with his mother, after Into focused on his relationship with his dad.  

Was not disappointed.  I don't talk during movies.  I leaned over, and whispered ""I think everyone here wishes that was their mom,"" and Sam locked eyes with me, nodding.  

It was a nicely written and expertly delivered monologue.",2023-06-02
"And now Miles literally has run into another Miles that needs help....aka her little boy that needs to be taken care of albeit from a different universe.

I see people saying that she has death flags, but I think she actually was foreshadowing the third movie.",2023-06-07
I got the implicates she is very aware of who he is,2023-06-03
"That line choked me up a tad. So heartfelt, such a great scene.",2023-06-08
MJ is anything but sincere and heart in Spiderman 2 lol,2023-06-29
"Oh god, if spider verse 3 ends up like spider man 3 I’m gonna cry",2023-06-03
I cried at this scene. Very touching and moving and relatable to me.,2023-06-11
Bruh. I teared up in the first five minutes of Gwen’s reintroduction.,2023-06-13
I was a bit thrown off by all this. He’s only 15 and they’re talking about letting him go? Like where? Your 15 year old just definitely be telling you where they are going….,2023-06-16
"Makes me think her words will reach him in universe 42, our miles will remember prowler miles is also her little boy. She evens says remember even when he gets/feels lost.",2023-06-19
I had no clue what tf that was supposed to be so I figured it had to be something from Venom lol,2023-06-02
There was a subtle reference to Morbius when Miles talked about wanting to see a movie about a good guy Vampire.,2023-06-04
To be honest that felt really out of place but that's probably because I'm not a big fan of the Venom films and her role in them seemed pretty small and nothing special.,2023-06-06
[deleted],2023-06-04
"Yeah, Gwen's story is ""done"", so to speak 

Now it's Miles' turn!",2023-06-02
"I'd argue that the majority of Gwen's choices are what led the movie, making her the protagonist.",2023-06-02
"I didn’t mention it in my review, but I LOVED the opening with Gwen. The recap, her band, her dad… it was oh so SO good.",2023-06-02
"The line that drove it home for me was when her dad said that he always taught her to play it by the book and the entire movie was her unlearning Miguel's ""book"" in favor of Miles' ""I'mma do my own thing"" approach.",2023-06-02
"This.

The film starts with Gwen leaving her band and the fallout between her and her father.

The middle of the film Gwen has basically accepted her role in a group of Spider-Men she's not 100% on board with, because the alternative is being sent back to her own dimension and being forced to confront her father.

The film ends with Gwen building bridges with her father, and her leading her own band of Spider-Men.

Into the Spiderverse is the story of Miles, Across the Spiderverse is the story of Gwen, I wouldn't be surprised if Beyond put a spotlight on Peter B (As well as finishing Miles two part story).",2023-06-02
"One particular thing I noticed was her realization. She knew that according to the 'canon', her father was going to die because he was a police captain, and every spiderman ""has"" to have a police captain ""close"" to spiderman die saving someone, that they themselves can't save.

But things changed. Her dad quit the force during his acceptance speech, meaning the circumstances changed. The intended canon changed. So she realized things don't have to go the way that the ""Spider AI"" (what was her name?) says they HAVE to go.",2023-06-02
"When the background started getting watery, so did my eyes",2023-06-02
"Gwen was ready for her Dad to die, only for him to quit, she was like in that moment thinking ""Wait...you can do that?""",2023-06-02
I loved everything but it definitely didn't feel like it's own movie to me. My girlfriend agreed so I didn't feel too crazy.,2023-06-03
"I still kind of disagree. I say kind of because I agree they did the Gwen stuff beautifully and I love your point of them starting and ending with Gwen. That said, it’s still a Miles Morales movie and he’s *clearly* the protagonist. So I still feel like this movie didn’t have a complete feel. I’m torn because I loved it so much, but like many others are saying, i feel like they were so close to perfection bur feel short with that ending (or lack thereof).",2023-06-05
"The movie starts with her out of synch with her band. That same theme song starts playing at the end and instead of devolving into chaos like at the beginning, it swirls up into a heroic crescendo as ""her band"" comes together. Loved it. But it also has me very, very, very afraid for what comes next.",2023-06-06
"Yeah the pacing is a bit wonky until you realize it’s meant to tell Gwen’s story, then you can recognize it’s beginning and why it ends where it ends instead of the other cliffhanger part where Miles is revealed to be in Earth-42.",2023-06-02
"The movie literally begins with her, ends with her, and both scenes share the same music motif. It is most definitly her movie, even if its not made the most prevelant always.",2023-06-03
And Gwen telling her dad helped to avoid her police chief dying moment.,2023-06-02
Disagree it definitely doesn’t feel like it’s own movie and the ending is just unsatisfying.,2023-06-02
I absolutely loved this too. Great choice,2023-06-02
I think this made the movie so much better that Gwen got the attention to her story that it needed. It would be a worse series if Gwen doesn't get her arc and we just do Miles perspective.,2023-06-03
"I was so excited for this movie, that I completely lost track that entire first scene was just an opening credits scene. I was fully prepared to watch a spider-Gwen movie feat miles morales",2023-06-05
I did not walk away from this movie feeling like it was a complete movie.,2023-06-16
"mhmm. Felt very Mad Max, which is great because Gwen as Furiosa moving the plot along was awesome.",2023-06-03
"Im glad she wasn’t just a side character in the movie. They did a wonderful job weaving her into to the film, I’m just bummed I have to wait for part 3.",2023-06-04
"Man, Hailee Steinfeld fucking killed it. And the animators too. Everything about Gwen was in-fucking-credibly well done.",2023-06-07
I like intro with gwen and her backstory etc also relates with miles why gwen understands what mile going thru parallels etc,2023-06-02
Even the watercolor backdrop was crying.,2023-06-02
"i'm glad she was a proper secondary lead this time, but obviously itsv couldn't do that when it was an origin",2023-06-02
"Reporting from Regal in NY, the sound mixing was very poor in the opening with Gwen and I could not hear anything during Spider Punks dialogue",2023-06-03
I love Gwen.,2023-06-05
"Miles is the lead of all 3 films. Spot is his villain, That's the main story.",2023-06-02
I wish I was more emotional haha,2023-06-03
"I didn't think of it that way when i saw it, thanks for that!",2023-06-04
"There was such emotional depth in this film at times, which being an animation is something else.",2023-06-06
"Ahhh, yesssss, after seeing the movie - I find it so hard to agree with the criticism that the movie didn't complete an arc. It did. It's a different beat. Emotional and character-driven.",2023-06-07
omg this changes the ending a lot for me thank you lol,2023-06-10
"Yeah, she had a the whole arc that carried the narrative, we start the film on her and end the film on her, she has that resolution with her dad AND she gets her ""band."" Felt like an earned ""ending."" You know she cares deeply about Miles so she's going to keep fighting. So good.",2023-06-26
"my thoughts as well. She bookended the movie, there's a complete arc for her here with the reconciliation with her dad pretty much acting as the climax of the movie. I mean, if that isn't your protagonist of the story, then what is?",2023-08-08

"Hell no, Into the Spiderverse is a near perfect movie AND it has a complete story, a begging, middle and an end. Across The Spiderverse doesn't even have a real ending, it just ends.

I'm convinced that was planned to some extent",2023-06-02
"It's not a retcon because retcons apply to changing the understanding of plot points.

Spot and the scientists that worked on the multiversal machine were already established. Spot himself didn't have any impact on Miles story in the first movie. There's plenty of space for concurrent stories to happen in story B that aren't relevant to story A, even if story B is made after story A is finished. 

Like all the old or new Canon for Star Wars that doesn't contradict the understanding of movies Canon.",2023-06-02
How were either of those a retcon?,2023-06-02
Really? That moment was so forgettable. Miles throws so many foods at so many bad guys.,2023-06-02
It reminded me of how in Far From Home the guy who Stane shouted the infamous box of scraps line was in on Mysterio's scheme. Had that same energy.,2023-06-02
Yeah I’m glad he wasn’t a former employee of the Tony Stark from Miles’ universe,2023-06-03

"I hate both of those retcons tbh.

Well maybe hate a strong word but I just feel like it's really unnecessary to make him the bagel guy or to explain why a super weapon might have a weak spot. Like I don't think people were questioning that when they watch Star Wars in 1978?",2023-06-04
Is it possible the bagel guy is this universes Peter Parker that didn't get bit? It would lend to.his whole not just being the villain of the week but being a main baddie someone to remember?,2023-06-02

In hindsight, I'm an idiot.",2023-06-02
"I got it the moment Miles stood in his room because in his world, his room is so detailed. In Earth-42, it was rather bland. Less line work. More washed out colors. 

I was wondering why it looked that way and then it smacked me like a ton of bricks, ""He is on the wrong Earth!""",2023-06-02
"A couple subtle hints. The purple jacket, miles' mom asking what happened to his hair, total shock.

I even talked to my friend how when the screen showed Earth42 as his home dimension all it got out of me was a ""oh, I didn't know that was his universe"". Show, don't tell, hide your clues in plain sight.

Total banger of a movie, probably gonna go see it again next week, hope they can get the audio in check at my theater though...",2023-06-02
"Right and as he was explaining to his mom, he said “I wish Dad was here” and obviously she gets it because his dad literally passed in that universe. But that wasn’t what he meant. Super subtle dialogue",2023-06-02
They did a good job of laying the groundwork for that moment. Describing the DNA machine and how his spider was from a different dimension helped set up the twist really well. It made sense and didn’t just feel like a twist for the sake of it.,2023-06-02

But then I doubted myself because it all seemed like he was in the right place with the scenes before and his talk with his mum.",2023-06-08
I'm so used to the MCU style of interjecting serious moments with jokes I really thought they were gonna go the joke route where his mom didn't know who Spiderman is. I didn't remember Mile's parents talked about Spiderman in the first movie,2023-06-08

Not trying to be rude but how? They showed the 42 very clearly multiple times then show the dna scan as 42 too.,2023-06-02
For some reason my first thought was it was the effects of the No Way Home spell at first lol.,2023-06-02
It's okay Miles didn't pick up the hints either,2023-06-06

"Riiiiiiiiiight, I was like ""noooooooo""",2023-06-11

"Seeing the different word over the head of his bed, milk crates and punching bag immediately got me.",2023-06-10
shouldn't the mom have said something about his hair being different?,2023-06-11
You would have noticed it when the DNA machine read him as 42 when he came from 1610 as stated in the intro,2023-06-11
"I saw that the machine scanned him as universe 42, and I thought it was an actual plothole, or that I was confused about why the radioactive spider was tagged that way. I should've known better, with these writers :D

I think his mom's eyes were a different color in 42 as well. They looked green in that scene, and I knew they were brown at the beginning.",2023-06-11
Her eyes were green vs wart 616 Rio’s hazel,2023-06-17

Unfortunately Miles going to Earth-42 was given away before he teleported. It popped up on the computer screen after reading his DNA so the big “reveal” fell flat on my end.,2023-06-04
">has a decent shot of being nominated for Best Picture

I think people are getting a bit ahead of themselves with that assertion. 

Loved the film but I probably wouldn't immediately think to label it as a best picture. Plus there's another 7+ months of film releases.",2023-06-02
"Right. Just to me now thinking about it, the movie is flawless. 10/10. It 100 percent deserves to be nominated for Best Picture.",2023-06-04
Best plot twist ever that they literally spelled out on screen?,2023-06-03
"It was 100% Gwen's story. That's why the cliffhanger is when it is. Her conflict was resolved both with her dad and finally finding her ""band""",2023-06-26
one of the directors comparing it to empire a month or two ago was babe ruth called grand slam levels of take,2023-06-04
"Best cliffhanger I've ever seen, the movie has you so immersed that you don't even feel like its about to end",2023-06-10
Was actually looking out when Miles was in the machine since I realized he is technically from two universes. The console even says Earth-42,2023-06-06
Deserves best cinematography too imo,2023-06-02
Gwen taking hobies converse could have foreshadowed her deviating from the stories spiderpeople are meant to follow and her choosing her own path. Choosing to grow rather than isolate and stay alone is what led to her dad choosing her too and changing his fate.,2023-06-19
"Spectacular is my *Firefly*, the one I always question ""what if?""",2023-06-02

I'VE BEEN SCROLLING FOR AGES LOOKING FOR THIS. Spectacular remains one of the best iterations of Spider-Man ever, and my only concrete hope going into this was that he would show up. Bot only did he, but they gave him a full, proper cameo. Fucking incredible.",2023-06-05
Final fantasy 10. And this is the 10th theatrical spiderman movie. That's a cool coincidence,2023-06-03

"Being Spider-Man makes canon events happen, is my guess.

It doesn't matter that Miles wasn't supposed to be Spider-Man, but the fact that he is, does.

His Peter very likely had a Canon event. Maybe even Miles' universes' Gwen",2023-06-02
"While Miles is the original anomaly, it corrected itself (peter parker dying) and he started going through the same canon events every spider-man goes through. However anomalies started happening afterwards anyway which was the whole point Miguel starting the spider society. Miles is essentially trying to create another anomaly by saving his dad and breaking the canon which would probably destroy his universe and spread to the others. The supervillain doing all of this also having dimension hopping powers also doesn't help.",2023-06-02
"probably an anomaly that would open up more anomalies 

Miguel might just be theorising and overthinking",2023-06-02
"Miguel isn't right. He's assuming a lot, and they're working on predictive algorithms for what's super-bad and what's just maybe a problem.

Could be that its canon, could be not. They can't risk it (or thats their logic, anyway).",2023-06-02
"I think that's purposefully ambigious.
A big theme of the movie is trust in the system vs trying a new way.

The system may not be the best to live it but it works (for now though it's getting worse) and it's a shame some people have to die and suffer but that's the cost of stability. You could shelter a kid and control their life.

Or... you can try something new. What if people didn't have to die? What if you let your kid go and explore and grow? Is it risky? Yes. But the alternative is passively letting bad things happen when you have the power to stop them.

It also plays into Miguel's questionable motives. The 3 statements:
""Miles isn't a spiderman because he is an anomaly""
""Spidermen not having their canon events breaks reality""
""Miles stopping (what looks like) his canon event will destroy his world because he is a Spiderman""
All of them can't all be 100% true.",2023-06-03
"I figured that he wouldn’t be able to stop his dad’s death, which would be the canon event, and so they didn’t want to invite him to the society to let everything happen naturally. However, once Miles figured it all out at the society, they had to keep him behind because otherwise he would go home and save his dad (as he did in the movie). So that’s why he wasn’t allowed to join, but then wasn’t allowed to leave after that",2023-06-02
"Like mama rio says ""Don't let anyone tell you you dont belong""",2023-06-02
"A lot of poor logic in Miguel's part. This was bugging me in the theater: Miguel showing Miles the death of his uncle Aaron in the line of canon events. Then showing that death of the captains are also canon events for some. And finally implying that since Miles' dad is going to be captain, he will die. 

Don't the spider-man gets one death of the closed one, as a canon event? 

Was upset, that it would not be explained, but now there is a possibility that Miguel is assuming a lot, and we get next movie, it could work out, actually",2023-06-02
[deleted],2023-06-11
i kind of assumed that the main reason he wasnt allowed to join was because gwen and peter b. wanted to spare him the foreknowledge of his dad dying,2023-06-02
"It might be because his dad was always destined to become captain, whether Miles or Peter was Spider-Man.",2023-06-03
i assume because the canon events happen to whomever spiderman in that universe is,2023-06-02
Miguel is overthinking,2023-06-03
He was not originally supposed to be Spider-Man but he is now. Him becoming Spider-Man is what killed his uncle and will (in theory) kill his dad.,2023-06-04
">Loved the movie, but can someone explain to me, if Miles was an anomaly, how is his dad a canon level event, or why did that matter? That was the only thing that confused me. He wasn’t allowed to join the society for that reason, but then when he was there, wasn’t allowed to leave?  

It's a contradiction and I suspect it's because 99s interpretation of canon events will turn out to be wrong",2023-06-04
Also If he Is not a spiderman then why his father Is a cop? What sort of coincidence Is this?,2023-06-09
"Had the same question - I have a feeling this will be key in the next film, honestly.",2023-06-09
Was that ever explicitly stated? I think Miles just assumed that.,2023-06-02
I think that was lie as an excuse to contain. The real problem was his existence.,2023-06-04
I think that’s how it gets resolved in Beyond - it’s not a canon event.,2023-06-05
"He was never supposed to be Spiderman, since his world already has Peter Parker. Spot pulled the 42-Spider through, which bit Spiderman Miles instead of Prowler Miles which leaves 42 without Spiderman. 

The whole deal with Miles’s dad is that they tried to keep him there so he wouldn’t save his dad, which is a canon event that every Spiderman went through (loss of a loved one), which is bullshit because Miles has already gotten his canon moment aka Aaron’s death in the last movie",2023-06-11
"Not sure you’re remembering two towers well, which ended with the heroes in a huge victory giving them hope to actually save middle earth. Gollum turning evil again was very vague of a cliffhanger rather than the bluntness of spiderverse",2023-06-03
"Great comp. First one was perfect, second one somehow, incredibly, matched or exceeded, third one best picture.",2023-06-02
Two Towers didn't end so abruptly though. Least to me. I never felt the sharp disappointment of a cliffhanger when it came out. But I was also a lot younger in 2002 vs 2023.,2023-06-02
"Two Towers has one of the greatest climaxes in any movie, and had a complete beginning/middle/end structure. I don't think this movie really compares. It's more like Deathly Hallows part 1 or The Hobbit part 1",2023-06-08
"But ends like Return of the King where it ends, and then had another ending, and then another ending",2023-06-03
"In the end, the LOTR trilogy might be a good comp for overall trilogy quality (assuming Beyond is just as good)",2023-06-04
This was more like deathly hallows part 1. It was still great,2023-06-04
YES,2023-06-26
"I figured something live action was coming after that Spot scene, but Donald Glover Prowler was at the bottom of my list",2023-06-02
This and the Spiderman PS4 references were so damn cool,2023-06-02
Guess he was plucked straight from the Hollandverse,2023-06-02
Completely out of left field and a great cameo to have him with his nephew,2023-06-02
I got so excited in the theatre and I think I was the only one who showed a reaction lmao,2023-06-02
"The way he stared at Miles for a second was a really nice touch after the whole “Donald for Spiderman” thing back in the day, plus him literally being the main inspiration for the Miles Morales character",2023-06-02
"DONALD FOR SPID…

Fuck it, at least we’re got the 6 seasons and the movie.",2023-06-02
"The layers behind this Easter egg is just insane.

The fact that Donald Glover's character in Community (the scene of him wearing a spider-man outfit) was the inspiration for why Brian Michael Bendis created Miles Morales. Years later, Donald Glover then voiced Miles Morales in Ultimate Spider-Man. THEN even more years later, Donald Glover was cast as Aaron Davis in the MCU. But now in across the spider-verse, he makes a cameo as the Prowler AND we even get a version of Prowler that's Miles Morales. 

ITS ALL CONNECTED LITERALLY. FULL CIRCLE.",2023-06-02
I didn’t get the reference. Can anyone ELI5 why this is a big deal? I have zero history on this or prowler or why Donald glover showing up here was such a big deal.,2023-06-02
Hypo Hustler movie hopefully confirmed bullshit. He’s gonna be Prowler.,2023-06-02
"Okay, so, since hes like the prowler, are we to assume that like, the miles in the MCU is probably about 13? Idk if they say when aaron davis starts doing the prowler thing but is the implication there somehow? Am i just insane? Probably.",2023-06-02
"Someone in the theater legit said, ""omg that's Michael B. Jordan."" :Facepalm:",2023-06-02
"So many people in my audience audibly shocked, I could not believe it COME TO THE MCU PLEASE",2023-06-02
Well... MCU Miles Morales coming soon??,2023-06-02
"I didn’t understand that, I knew I missed something from the audience reaction. Could you explain it please?",2023-06-02
"My jaw dropped when he popped up on the screen. 

Some of the people around me didn't get the reference to my disappointment.",2023-06-03
I wonder if he's the OG from 199999 or a variant,2023-06-03
"Was so happy when he showed up. Man, I love me some Dong Lover.",2023-06-04
"I KNOW RIGHT? I feel like I was the only one in my theater who got the reference (yeah, I am the annoying dude that gasps loudly)",2023-06-11
"I just saw it today and a little girl maybe 8or9 behind me said out loud, ""it's post Malone"" the entire theater lost it!",2023-06-21

"Damn, I wish I didn't open this thread right before watching the movie",2023-06-02
Just a full on fuck yeah,2023-06-02
It's made even greater because it's foreshadowing the twist in the end.,2023-06-02
the live action stuff in this movie was so good,2023-06-02
Could also be Miles?,2023-06-03
"After all these years, confirmed",2023-06-03
It felt like a SpongeBob SquarePants episode with how surreal it was.,2023-06-03
So the real question is is he 616s prowler after encountering Tom?,2023-06-03
I didn’t even realize this was an MCU connection holy shit I forgot all about that,2023-06-03
Damn. I didn’t realize until the end that Glover actually is his universe’s Miles and not Aaron.,2023-06-04

"Yep. Watching Guardians 3 and ATSV month after month has hammered down the fact that people, myself included, just have lazy crappy movie fatigue and not superhero fatigue.",2023-06-05
"Big agree. I was done with MCU after how much I didn't care for End Game. The Spider-verse movies give me a sense of wonder and joy I thought I had lost.

If Beyond the Spider-verse knocks it out of the park, this will hands down be the best trilogy of all time for me.",2023-06-04
"ESPECIALLY WHEN they try something new! I thought for sure that Captain Stacy or Captain (lieutenant) morales were gonna die in the movie like in the opening action sequences or some point at the end but the fact that the movie was ABOUT that very fact? That all these spiderman stories must play out the same way, and that the plot of the movie was fighting that canon?? Amazing",2023-06-08
"> I am just sick of bad marvel and dc films.

I don't have super hero movie fatigue, I have MARVEL formula fatigue. Never changing the status quo _(except, ironically, in Spider-Man NWH, another Spider-Man movie)_ - anything post 2014 Marvel _(The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy)_ is alright, and anything after Infinity War/Endgame is really mah save for NWH - playing everything too safe, status quo unchanged, no repercussion, no consequences, really annoying and uninspired. Very sterile and too safe...

And DC, well... DC Movies just suck 80% of the time, can't wait for the full universe reboot!",2023-06-12
Marvel’s recent movies don’t even feel like superhero movies. The characters aren’t heroic. Ant-Man and Thor are jokes. Doctor Strange is a dick. This movie actually felt heroic.,2023-06-10
I'll support this take.,2023-06-03

I gave up with MCU almost a decade ago, and spiderverse had me so excited for a superhero film for the first time in years. I just want the third one to be a good ending to a trilogy. I don't want forced tie ins or MCU teases. Just make a kickass third act.",2023-06-14

Quite honestly going back I don't know how I missed that it wasn't Miles's universe,2023-07-01
Missed that! So many great little details.,2023-06-29
YES! I could especially barely understand anything during Gwen's opening section. I also could barely understand SpiderPunk because his levels were low.,2023-06-02
"I thought I was going crazy, you could barely hear the dialogue. Hopefully it's fixed soon for a rewatch.",2023-06-02
"Yeah, right from the opening with Gwen narrating over her drumming, I did a doubletake and was like, ""uh, why is she so quiet?"" It was even worse during fight scenes. It didn't necessarily impact my enjoyment of the movie all that much, but I definitely look forward to rewatching it with subtitles.",2023-06-02
"I noticed that too. From what I’m told, there was a memo sent out to raise the audio for this specific movie that I guess our theatres didn’t get :P",2023-06-02
"Yeah, Gwen’s opening monologue is pretty indecipherable. Not sure how that got approved",2023-06-02
I thought I needed to get my hearing checked at the beginning,2023-06-02
Spider-punk was the worst offender for me. Seemed like an awesome character but I heard like 3 of his lines,2023-06-02
Yes but it seemed to improve as the movie went on. The first scenes were definitely low though.,2023-06-02
"The movie was shipped with [specific instructions to crank up to volume](https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/1664397270467624961?t=a1ED31RWhYdcdP-XDnrfuQ&s=19), some projectionists might not be paying attention",2023-06-02
"Yeah, a lot of the times throughout the film for me.


Couldn't hear Gwen at the start nor could I hear what the Indian Spiderman was saying(and it wasn't just because his accent, his whole volume was almost nonexistent).",2023-06-02
Good to know it’s not my hearing going. As soon as it was over I was saying how im buying it day 1 to rewatch at home with subtitles,2023-06-02
Could not hear the majority of Indian and British spiderman’s lines,2023-06-02
"Yeah the sound mixing was extremely quiet. Everyone in the cinema had to be silent or you couldn't hear anything. Couldn't hear Gwen's speech either like you said. 

Multiple people complained afterwards and the cinema said they think it's an issue with the mix. 

Gonna watch it in IMAX again on the weekend to see if that's any more audible.",2023-06-02
"It was so bad, ruined the experience for me a bit. Needless to say, I will watch it again with subs on.",2023-06-02
"Our dialog was barely audible at the beginning. A few minutes in I went out and found an usher and told him the sound was too low. He said they’d fix it, and that they’d been having issues with sound on this film. It took a few minutes but eventually the volume did get louder. Still never a good mix though. But at least I could hear what they were saying.",2023-06-02
"I did notice that the audio mix was a bit wonky, and I even saw it in a Dolby theater.  It didn't take me out of the movie though, I grew accustomed to it after a while.",2023-06-02
"Yea, mine was very quite too. Kinda made me a little upset because I thought the theatre was fucking up but it sounds like it was just the way it was made.",2023-06-02
"Yep, I went and told one of the employees my theater was too quiet haha.",2023-06-02
the Gwen drumming intro was especially bad with this but the rest of the movie sounded fine,2023-06-02
"Watched in Cinemark XD and had the same issues with dialogue volume. Straight up couldn't hear certain parts when the music was going at the same time. 

Nothing experience ruining but a mild annoyance at times. Absolutely beautiful movie all the way through otherwise!",2023-06-02
"Agreed about the sound mixing.

I actually work at the cinema where I saw the film, so I figured someone hadn't set the playlist up right and the Dolby Atmos hadn't kicked in making all the sound feel flat and omnidirectional, went and checked the projector and the sound stack to realize it's just the way the film had been mixed.

But it made Gwen's opening monologue, Spiderpunk, and a few scenes in the Spider Society really hard to hear - especially with a sold out screen of people munching on popcorn and slurping on drinks.",2023-06-02
"If there was ever a movie theater film that needed subtitles, I feel it was definitely this one. As soon as Gwen started talking over those drums, I had no idea what she was saying.",2023-06-02
Yes!! Incredibly frustrating but I’m so glad it wasn’t just my shitty AMC. Will be seeing it again!!,2023-06-02
"Glad I found your comment, my local movie theater isn't the best as they've had a lot of audio/video issues before. I was totally blaming them. My girlfriend was the first to notice even though she almost never notices audio issues.

But we already noticed it during the trailers, maybe that was just my theater?",2023-06-02
Saw it at the Alamo and couldn't hear a damn thing they were saying for most of the movie.,2023-06-02
"Wait that's so weird, I thought the exact opposite. It felt like the score was so quiet. To the point that I thought an audio channel may have been broken in my Dolby screening. I expected more boom from the music. 

I'm planning to see it again on a different screen. I guess I'll see if it was just my screen or not.

Update: IMAX audio on my rewatch was much louder (and better imo). I really liked the movie on first viewing but LOVED it on the second viewing.",2023-06-02
"I didn't catch one thing that Spiderpunk said, to which Miles responded ""what?"" and was explained, but that was about it.",2023-06-02
Wow thought it was just me,2023-06-02
I definitely noticed it too. Could barely make out the stuff Spider Punk was saying,2023-06-02

I actually went down to the theater workers and told them I think somethings wrong. They didn't fix it.,2023-06-02
Wow. I went to a new theater and thought it was them. It was a huge screen but i wasn't being punched by the sound like it should have been. Sucks this might be how the film is mixed because you don't start a film off with drums bashing a beat and it sounding like it doesn't matter.,2023-06-02
Yeah i saw it in Dolby and it was way too low... Only negative when seeing it,2023-06-02
bro yes! Thought it was my drummer ears finally getting to me. Glad it wasn’t just me. The mixing was off as hell. Music was way too loud,2023-06-02
Spider-Punk was pretty hard to make out.,2023-06-02
Yeah the mixing was awful,2023-06-02
Yes! It was bad. So bad that I was like “I think I loved it? I’ll have to watch it at home with subtitles to be really sure.”,2023-06-02
"I thought it was just the cinema screen I was watching it on; crazy to hear lots of others have had this issue with the movie. The sound mixing was atrocious. Loud music, muted explosions & almost mono-like dialogue. Strange.",2023-06-02
"More attention needs to be drawn to this.  Everything about the movie was top tier except for the fact I could barely hear Gwen or SpiderPunk, which was really distracting.",2023-06-03
Oh shit. My local AMC Dolby Atmos theater showing had audio issues in the beginning. Sounded way too quiet for a theater experience.,2023-06-02
Yes!!! The sound was really low but I thought it was just my theatre!,2023-06-02
"Just the first scene with Gwen narrating while drumming.  Got maybe half of her lines, no problem at all with the rest of the movie.",2023-06-02
"I wasn't noticing it by the end - or even less than a half-hour in, really - but the opening was absolutely much quieter than reasonable. Lasted all of Gwen's intro and much of re-intro to Miles as well.",2023-06-02
"definitely, it was harder to hear the characters with thick accents. Will have to watch it again with subtitles in the future",2023-06-02
YUP I was thinking why tf is it so hard to hear what Gwen was saying in the opening scene? It got better but it sounds like it was poor mixing in production,2023-06-02
Yes and once again with most modern movies the audio mixing in general is bad for actually hearing dialogue. Hopefully they can patch the movie (can't believe that is thing that happens now) so that the audio is better.,2023-06-02
"Saw it in Dolby and the volume was very low in the beginning, which is super weird for Dolby. Stepped out and asked guest services if volume could be raised, and when I sat back down it sounded much better.",2023-06-02
"YEA.  My theater is actually usually pretty good for audio, but for some reason it was tough to pick out the dialogue. I’m wondering if it’s actually the movie, maybe it was just mixed for imax and sent to everyone 


I don’t know.",2023-06-03
"Bruhhh, same with me...thought I my ears are bad... When Gwen started narrating over the drums in the opening I was like ""RAISE THE VOLUME!!!""",2023-06-03
I could not hear the Ben Reilly dialogue in his first appearance,2023-06-03
"Saw this in IMAX and thought the same. Great movie but I had trouble understanding some of the characters, not just Spider-Punk",2023-06-03
Yes!! Thought it was just me.,2023-06-02

"The entire movie. Gwen at the beginning, Punk throughout, Miles on 2099 universe. Super annoying.",2023-06-02
Okay it wasn't just me. Dialogue was super low under the music.,2023-06-03

"I'm starting to think there is an epidemic of poor hearing. 

Every single time I have gone to see a movie people say this about, I have not had that problem. Yes this is anecdotal, yes there are countless reasons why. 

But I have a hard time believing that these movies mixing from the studios are being released in such a broken manner. Why? Good question... It's not like there aren't examples all over of poor decisions by businesses. So it's definitely possible it's negligence. 

But especially in an animated film where the production has complete control over it...

Not trying to say you are wrong or anything, it's certainly not your fault.",2023-06-02
Same. Odd sound mixing choices must’ve been in the movie then.,2023-06-02
"Sometimes this happens depending on where you're sitting in the theater. This time, I was close to the front, and felt like the voices were too low. In other movies, when I sit more centered and further back, the sound mixing isn't as noticeable.",2023-06-02
Same here,2023-06-02
"Weirdly mine did as well, more so to begin with. As it went on thankfully it stopped being an issue.",2023-06-02
For sure. I think it got a little better after the start but it would dip,2023-06-02
same here!,2023-06-02
"Was quiet in mine, super wejrd",2023-06-02
Oh shit - I complained to my cinema and got my money back for this. I thought they had fucked up the audio,2023-06-02
Went to an IMAX screening and it was slightly blurry and had the same issue as you unfortunately,2023-06-02
Glad it wasn’t just me. I’m planning to rewatch in IMAX now hah,2023-06-02
Ohh I thought it was just my cinema! I missed half of what she was saying,2023-06-02
Yes this was my only complaint. I missed some of Gwen’s dialogue because of the mixing,2023-06-02
"My ONLY issue with the film. The audio was a little too low sometimes and some characters spoke a little too fast during action sequences, not helped by the loud clashing of buildings tearing apart and and people screaming. But like other than that it was perfect.",2023-06-02
Yup,2023-06-02
yeah i was wondering if it was a cinema problem or a movie problem but it didn't affect my enjoyment,2023-06-02
Dolby cinema was great today,2023-06-02
I couldn’t hear most of the beginning over the guy next to me chewing SO loud on his popcorn,2023-06-02
yes but good thing i work in a movie theater so i knew where to make it louder,2023-06-02
"Mine definitely did, particularly and unfortunately during the intro (Gwen lines) and the run up to the end (also Gwen lines).",2023-06-03
"Yeah, I experienced the same. I thought it was just our theater fucking up.",2023-06-03
"It was mainly just Miguel who was doing the blaming, and the biggest reason was that he blamed Miles for the Super-Collider fracturing the multiverse in the first place (i.e. in Miguel's eyes Blonde!Peter died because he was distracted trying to save Miles instead of destroying the device).",2023-06-02
"Yeah Miguel was being such a dick, did he not realise that miles was just an innocent kid who was at the right place at the right time? If anything they should be blaming the spot for bringing the spider there in the first place.",2023-06-02
"i sorta think that, but also I think it's more that they realize that now that he is an anomaly, him not understanding the gravity of his choices affects them all, and since they all suffered similar fates, they all want to save what little they have left.",2023-06-02
"Because from their point of view, Miles is an anomaly. Responsibility has nothing to do with it, it's more of a ""your whole existence is a mistake, it's not your fault but you better listen to us kid or I'll slam you into a train to the moon"".",2023-06-02
"I adored this movie. But it definitely did a thing I hate in movies where two characters have a misunderstnding and instead of explainig or asking questions they just fight.

When spot first revealed how Miles ""created"" him no one asks why he was even there. Everyone else had evacuated, how was Miles supposed to know. No one pointed that out.

Or no one explained why they didnt tell Miles he was an anamoly. Maybe don't mention the dad but if they had explained to him the spider-verse maybe he wouldn't have recklesly followed Gwen.

Theres a few moments that don't break the film but they bother me.",2023-06-06
"I don't think they blame him for being bitten by a spider from another dimension, or else they wouldn't let him continue on in his own world while they clean up all the anomaly mess themselves. It wasn't until Miles entered into their HQ that he heard about the Canon events and refused to go along with it for Miguel to really lay into Miles personally for being the original anomaly. No one blamed Miles for being the original anomaly, but he was threatening everything they all were working so hard for so long for which is an understandable reason to be upset.",2023-06-06
My theory is that the spider that bit Miles was supposed to bite Miguel (who is not *actually* a Spider-Man). The whole “blame Miles” bs is just a cover.,2023-06-03
"It caused so many problems, they do not care lol",2023-06-02
"The beginning was weirdly quiet for me. Volume seemed to ramp up after the opening, but Gwen's opening definitely seemed quiet for a movie in a theater.",2023-06-02

Not just you. Others here including myself had the same experience,2023-06-02

Apparently this is an issue with a lot of peoples theaters so you're not alone!,2023-06-05
Tons of people here have mentioned weird audio levels. I could barely hear it too,2023-06-10
"Yeah, I was at the Alamo Drafthouse in LA, and they didn’t even get it right. I was really hoping after this movie had been out for a week, they would do it right. I heard the responsibility falls on the theater.

And if that movie theater, made for Cinefiles in a city made for Cinefiles can’t get it right, I can’t even imagine what it must sound like another theaters across the nation",2023-06-16
Happened to my theater as well,2023-07-16
The colors changing in the background between her and her dad to reflect the tension and mood was impeccable,2023-06-02

Also how they merged into pinkish/purple after they figured things out was a nice touch.,2023-06-22
"I genuinely think the stuff he was stealing was to build the watch he gave gwen at the end but I could also be mistaken, I never saw the one he had originally but as far as I can tell miguel made them standard design for everyone. But it played so nicely into his character he could have just been rebelling against the system.",2023-06-02

"I actually saw a little black kid taking a super proud picture in front of the Spider-Man poster and telling his dad “I wanna be like Spider-Man” and it was so fuckin cute to see a real life example of what representation in a super hero universe means

One of the details I noticed was that in Mumbattan the onomatopoeia was in Hindi,2023-06-10
"I have seen the movie 3 times, and what I love about Spider-Punk stealing stuff, you can see one scene where Miles actually takes one of the pieces Spider-Punk was stealing from his hands and places it on the table, and immediately Spider-Punk swipes it back and pockets it.

Loved Spider-Punk so much",2023-06-18

"What I find funny about this message is that out of eight live action films, only one of them explored Peter's greatest tragedy outside of Uncle Ben [Gwen's death] - and altered it so much that it didn't have the impact it was meant to on his character. 

I'm a big fan of Miles' new storyline and the fight against a pattern, but a small part of me will always want that bridge scene to be faithfully adapted.",2023-06-02
"Miguel might as well have said ""hey Miles, have you ever heard of Spider Totems? Morlun? The Inheritors? Well that shit was in the comics, and that means it's SACRED!""",2023-06-02
"Felt more like a criticism of the fandom to me. People wanting Spider-Man to be one thing, one type of guy. 

Considering how many chuds refuse to even acknowledge Miles as Spider-Man because of his ethnicity and background, this felt like a direct attack against that thinking. 

And then the main Spider-People featured in this being an English black man, a Hispanic man, an Indian teen, a white woman, and then a Black woman. Peter B Parker was the only main Spider-Persom to fall into the archetypal Parker.",2023-06-03
"I think reading it as a critique is a mistake. It’s metafiction. It’s acknowledging how things are structured and deconstructing it, but that doesn’t mean the message is that the structure is poor.",2023-06-02
"Of course, if you look closely (it was in one of the pictures during the exposition), the movie also implied that one of the ""canon events"" was Peter marrying Mary Jane...",2023-06-02
"Your post just triggered something in my brain:

The Cabin in the Woods is to Horror movies as Across the Spider-verse is to Spider-Man stories.",2023-06-03
"The only difference here is that Miguel's motivation is due to seeing a whole world cease to exist. Watching his ""daughter"" die in his arms made his path for him.",2023-06-02
"When Miguel was telling Miles how the spider that bit him was from another universe and he wasn’t supposed to be Spider-Man and was in fact depriving Earth 42 of their own spiderman, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was the writers way of touching on the racist criticism people had of miles morales when he first premiered in the comics?

Just so many mentions of Miguel saying “you’re not supposed to be here, you don’t belong here” kind of gave off that vibe to me. I’m probably reading more into this than I should but I wonder if anybody else got that interpretation?",2023-06-04
"I would not be surprised if this is also a reflection of what happens to a Spider-Man comic when the publisher cancels that serialization. It is not just the fault of the writers that many of those comics have the same story beats. The readers also expect that kind of dramatic origin story and if they don't get it, they stop buying the comics, ""destroying"" that universe.

It is a bit of a fourth-wall breaking slap to the audience (who were also looking forward to the same ""canon events"" in the previous movie). But, after seeing what Phil Lord and Christopher Miller did in The Lego Movie, I would not put it past them.",2023-06-03
feels super apt for a miles morales story too,2023-06-02
They absolutely cooking,2023-06-02
Mayday is a miracle baby; the miracle that Peter can have a happy timeline,2023-06-04
"When the superior spider-man was a thing, I thought to myself ""imagine if peter parker was dead, and otto was spider-man from now on. Imagine if spider-man was a villain in the comics from this day forward. Comic books can actually have a drastic effect on American pop culture with that one move, after a while, if they stick with it.""

That would've been really interesting, because it'd start in the comics and eventually be in TV shows, then movies, etc.",2023-06-03
"Taking into account how the current comics are going, it couldn't have come at a better time",2023-06-03
"> Spider-Man must never change, you have to follow the same beats,” is a direct reflection of the writers who keep dragging Peter back from anything different, new, and exciting.

And it works doubly well, because even though these are *Miles'* movies, the middle-aged burnout Peter B Parker is both the most relatable *and* the most admirable Peter Parker I can remember (though I've only dabbled in the comics) largely because he's so different from previous portrayals, and that difference is largely ""what's a logical place for this decent-hearted super-powered basket case to end up at if we ever let him stop being a wisecracking youth?""",2023-06-14
"It is clear as day that this entire trilogy is Miles' variant of the traditional Spider-man story.

Miles makes this clear by saying he is tired of everyone telling him what his story needs to be, and hops off into Earth-42.",2023-06-02
Oh that’s 100% it. When Miguel is talking about canon moments it shows the wedding issue. That’s a big middle finger consider it’s reverse I’d consider the worst/controversial Spidey story ever.,2023-06-04
"I’m not even comic reader, and *I’m* waiting on those cowards to undo One More Day…",2023-06-04
"I had taken it as a critique of foamer fans who get outraged at those few adaptations that do deviate from 'the canon,' but your take is way better.",2023-06-03
"We don’t spend any significant time with even ONE person named Peter Parker for at least the first hour of the movie, if not more. They’re definitely trying to emphasize the non-Peter spider-men, or to your point, the ones who don’t completely follow the same beats",2023-06-05
"Even the MCU Spider-Man went for the backdoor with the Aunt May version of exactly the same storyline.

Plus the Spider-Shrink deadpanning: ""Let me guess, your Uncle Ben died.""",2023-06-08
The fact they have Mayday in the movie makes that clear.,2023-06-02
This is a nice interpretation.,2023-06-05

"I see how you see that, but I always view it as rules for time travel in which there are certain events that need to happen for a world to exist. You can try and change the event from happening but time will fight back and correct itself. Sorta like steins gate",2023-06-03
"Irony is they still have the Peter Parker in Miles verse die along with his uncle basically giving him his own speech. So o actually can’t take it that seriously considering they flopped at this regardless because there is still clearly a “Cannon” moment that allows him to be Spider-Man. Funny commentary. But an arguably failed one. And this isn’t even a Spidey thing. All heroes all have some “Cannon” event that has to happen in order for them to become who they are.

So if they technically wanted to tell a message to make future Spider-Man Films move for the “better” they failed because they retold that same story in the first one. Still a solid movie tho, just don’t think any Comic Book writer is gonna take this Meta Commentary seriously. Nor would I blame them tbh.",2023-06-03
It's soooo meta,2023-06-05
"It really did feel like South Park in terms of how it made fun of both sides of the Spider-Man “editorial vs fandom” clash through the Canon Events and Miles being classified as an “anomaly”. But instead of wringing the most humor that it can out of this concept like South Park does, they use that information to add more nuance to the actions of the main characters and to the overall concept of Spider-Man. It also feels more subtle.

TL;DR, Matt and Trey walked so that Lord and Miller could run.",2023-06-06
Reminds me of The Cabin in the Woods,2023-06-06
I remember when they made Peter forget about MJ. Like for real it was reported in the newspaper lol Spidey can’t catch a break,2023-06-07
"Hah!!  I was focused on Miguel telling Miles he didn't belong and got his Peter killed, and how it was probably a meta-commentary on fan reception when Miles Morales was first introduced, but the rest you brought up is so obvious in hindsight.",2023-06-10
"Just watched the film yesterday and it may be my favorite movie in 40 years of cinema but I have a question and I can't find the answer so I'm just going to ask you, random internet stranger.

Why did Miles have to lose his dad or Gwen hers? Didn't Miles  already lose his uncle? And Prowler Miles lost his father. Gwen lost Peter. Why was that a Canon Event? Seemed like they all already sacrificed someone of import.

I'm sure I'm missing the obvious but I need someone to clear this up so this film can be the perfect masterpiece for me it clearly is.",2023-06-25
"They even showed the wedding that led to one of the most hated comics of all time, didn't they? When they had that little triple-picture and showed Spider-Punk leaving his outfit in the dumpster?",2023-06-27

"In hindsight I think the amount of hype about the length was totally done to help pull off the cliffhanger twist. They knew they had a 2 and a half hour movie that breezed by, so they played it up.

Like I figured it would be a wrong universe deal with the classic “fake out” thing they were pulling with Gwen. “Earth 42 Miles is the Prowler” was a huge twist for me. Especially  now they established there’s only one Miles Spiderman. Doing ESB in this day and age and selling is top notch.,2023-06-02

"I hated the to be continued, and I think the movie is worse because of it. Call me crazy but I believe each movie should tell a complete, satisfying story in its own right even if it is just a part of series. What was there was incredible, but I don't want to watch a 4 hour movie which is ostensibly what they're doing. I think they could've kept most of it the same but reworked it to make this movie more satisfying.",2023-06-05
My theatre was not happy,2023-06-02
"Several people in the screening I was in seemed annoyed by the cliffhanger. A lady behind me muttered ""oh, come on!"" and when the tag promising that Miles will return showed up, someone in the row in front of me said ""yeah, return to rip us off.""

"Honestly, I put it together as Miles was firing up the machine because they had mentioned so many times and made such a big deal about how the spider that bit him came from a different universe. They said that the machine scans your DNA to send you back to the corresponding dimension, but what they don't mention that context clues give is WHICH DNA it's scanning for and there's only one true constant with everyone in the lobby, it's the Spider-DNA. So, if Miles is expecting that the machine is going to scan for his human DNA, I figured that almost right then and there. Kinda felt like a Doctor Who cliffhanger to be honest, in a good way. To have something go correctly would deflate the story and there's only one logical place for Miles to go, the origin of his Spider-DNA.",2023-06-04

He was such a fun character but so many of his lines got buried by the audio mix. They were worth straining for though,2023-06-08
Having Spider-Punk and Spider-Noir together in the next one should be fun.,2023-06-04
My favourite new character might be Miguel or spider punk I really like inside lewin davis and Oscar isacc is a great actor. But I also liked the Indian spider man,2023-07-08
I remember loving the line but cannot for the life of me remember what it was referring to.,2023-06-02
"i was dying at that line, and his one to mayday",2023-06-02
Spider-Punk was by far my favorite of the spidermens,2023-06-04
"I was the only person in my theater who laughed at that, but that's ok",2023-06-04
I thought he was really pretentious at first but he really came through for Miles.,2023-06-12
"He was hilarious and my fav animations style. 

But I do think its weird they decided in this movie that the alternate universes/spidermans they'd introduce are just different cultures? So there's a British universe?? And an Indian universe?? And if Manhattan becomes Mumbaihattan, whats their Mumbai like? Mumbaimumbai?",2023-06-25
You mean super cringey,2023-06-07
pretty sure I was the only person in my theater to laugh at that,2023-06-10
"was getting annoyed by him mid way, all the propoganda references and too cool for you and I dont listen to you build your own that, but he did come through with his words. He's alright.",2023-06-03
"Nah it was stupid. They were jerking off their basement-dwelling fanbase, and it was obvious. The ""Spider-Punk"" was just every communist redditor's wet dream, and their catering obviously worked, you are a living example. A classic anarchist would be great, but they had to ruin the character with the propaganda.",2023-06-03
He should watch documentaries about communist times in Poland. He would change his mind immediately,2023-06-03
Thought he said it was a miracle of capitalism but same difference,2023-06-03
Biggest laugh in the movie for me.,2023-06-04
Only me laughed at my theater. Not ashamed at all.,2023-06-13
Spider Punk is GG Allin,2023-06-19
How *is* he so cool even without the mask though?!,2023-06-26
"So we’re just gonna pretend this wasn’t coming from a movie that’s part of the mechanism that’s completely subsuming the movie business and in some ways narrative storytelling and *itself* is the worst version of capitalism destroying a good thing??

I loved the movie and spider punk got a kick out of me but this line was eye rolling at best and genuinely insulting given the movie it was in at worst.",2023-06-28
i think yaaa men the spider pank was so fucken good,2023-12-22
"I'm not gonna lie to you, Miles had to give up on Gwen after meeting Hobie. You got a toothbrush in his dimension? And leaving cardigans? Lost the game before I ever hit the court.",2023-06-02
Miles and hobbie have some real chemistry thats all im gonna say,2023-06-02
When i heard that there is going to be a love triangle in the movie i expected miles and hobie fighting over gwen and not hobie and gwen fighting over miles,2023-06-02
If they give me bisexual Black spider man I'm gonna explode with joy lol,2023-06-02
"Kinda disappointed they never addressed any of that after Hobie comes to screen. Like suddenly Miles is no longer jealous?

It was a cool dynamic to have",2023-06-16
"Miguel isn’t letting the cops die to disrupt the system, he’s doing it to uphold yet another establishment (albeit an inter dimensional one, rather than a governmental one).",2023-06-03
"Within the first 3 minutes of the movie I contemplated going outside and asking someone to turn the volume up, you aren’t alone",2023-06-02
You're not alone! I just posted a similar comment about the sound mixing. Is your theater in Montreal?,2023-06-02
I saw it in Dolby at an AMC. Totally had this problem.,2023-06-02
Same for me. I could barely understand anything during Gwen's whole opening and it was REALLY DIFFICULT to hear anything SpiderPunk said.,2023-06-02
Yeah sound mixing was particularly bad in the beginning and end. Everything else was fine. Dialogue was missed in the drumming parts,2023-06-02
"I thought there was something wrong at the beginning and saw someone get up (no clue if he was going to ask or something else likely), but then throughout the movie there were parts I felt I needed to lean forward to hear better. It’s wasn’t very surround sound. Seemed to come all from the front.",2023-06-02
"During the opening with Gwen and her thing, I legit thought my theaters audio was fucked or something. Then we got the title card and everything was a lot better.",2023-06-02
"The movie was shipped with [specific instructions to crank up to volume](https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/1664397270467624961?t=a1ED31RWhYdcdP-XDnrfuQ&s=19), some projectionists might not be paying attention",2023-06-02
"Felt the same at SF Metreon. Had a hard time hearing Gwen most of the movie, really.",2023-06-02
And was is echoing when anyone was explaining their back story? This is up there with tenet for great movies with bad sound editing.,2023-06-02
Yup! I definitely missed out on some SM India and Spider-Punk dialog :(,2023-06-02
That was my experience as well. The beginning was very quiet but as the movie went on the sound mixing seemed to improve even though i still missed a chunk of the dialogue (mostly from the British spider man),2023-06-02
We had the exact opposite problem.  We could barely hear the music but higher ranged sounds and dialog were fine.  Sucks because the first movie great loud music but we missed out because our theater's sound system is scuffed.,2023-06-02
"Nolan and his damned dialogue mixi-... wait, that's not right...",2023-06-02
"I already watched it twice and had that issue with the first theater. It wasn’t nearly as bad for the second (I couldn’t understand Spider-Man India or Spider Punk at my first showing at all), so I think the issue can be mitigated depending on the theater. My second viewing I  heard and understood all of the dialogue I couldn’t at the first (but that was an Atmos theater, so that’s probably why)",2023-06-02
Minneapolis AMC reporting in. Couldn’t hear shit!,2023-06-02
"I just commented the same thing before seeing this.

It's not just you/your theater. There were multiple parts where I could barely understand the dialogue, including that opening monologue.",2023-06-02
"absolutely had the same experience. super weird audio mixing, felt like I missed a lot of dialogue",2023-06-02
Noticed this too! It definitely seemed quieter in Gwen's opening and then either it got louder or I got used to it. There were some other hard to hear moments too,2023-06-02
"Agreed completely. While I’d love to call this movie perfect, it’s hard to call a part 1 perfect and the sound mixing was noticable in enough instances to be an issue. I can’t wait to watch this with subtitles for those moments, but overall it doesn’t take away from my overall impression of the film, as the visuals and score were the more incredible parts of this film - in that order",2023-06-02
My sound was also so low,2023-06-02
It was also very quiet at the IMAX in Portland.,2023-06-02
i didn't hear a work that spider-punk said,2023-06-02
"The sound cut out in my theater right when they got to the Spider-Hub, didn't come back on for about 30 min (most people walked to the lobby to avoid spoilers/let the staff know), so they rewound it back to the Mumbattan scene. 

Frustrating to lose an hour of my life, but didn't mind rewatching that sequence. Such a beautiful film.",2023-06-02
Interesting I didn't have this problem in my theater but I'm definitely watching this movie a few more times to be sure.,2023-06-02
No! Spot on! I knew I wasn't crazy. Maybe I need to watch it in IMAX lol,2023-06-02
Yes! The dialogue track was absolutely buried from the start,2023-06-02
I thought I was just unlucky and picked a bad seat in my theater the sound mixing was HORRIBLE i couldnt understand almost half the movie unless the music was dead silent or people were yelling,2023-06-02
"We had the same issue in Charlotte, NC - the manager at our AMC said it’s been a nationwide issue with the surround sound on this movie. We left and went to a Dolby screening at another theater and the sound was amazing there",2023-06-02
"Holy shit it was like that in my theater, too. I guess it was the mix itself. Nolan would be proud.",2023-06-02
Australia here...the narration parts were some of the worst audio mixing ive ever heard,2023-06-02
"It was bad in my theater too. Damn near impossible to hear what was being said at some points, and at others there was a bad echo",2023-06-02
I HATE when the sound is too low in movies. It happened to me a few times and it usually drives me up the wall. Luckily it didn't happen to me in this case but I'm pretty sure the right side speakers were off for some reason. Lol,2023-06-02
I was at an IMAX and the beginning monolog by Gwen was drowned out by the drums. I've never been to an IMAX so I thought it was just an IMAX thing,2023-06-02
"People around me were reacting to the dialogue and I honestly thought I needed to book an appointment with an audiologist. I couldn’t make out half of what was said.

Follow-up:  contacted my theatre chain’s customer service department and received a refund. I’ll do a re-watch when I have access to subtitles.",2023-06-09
"Definitely had an issue for the opening, I felt that the way the dialog track was mixed in the last movie was pretty rough too.",2023-06-02
I had this problem as well. It was bizarre how much I had to strain to hear certain bits of dialogue,2023-06-02
Yep. Had this problem as well.,2023-06-02
"I thought I was going crazy, the audio felt so off",2023-06-02
I hadthe opposite problem. Thought the music wasnt loud enough. The whole first section didnt hit for me because the music was so quiet to me.,2023-06-02
Same issue in an IMAX showing in Ohio. Couldn’t understand Gwen during the opening and missed the majority of dialogue from Spider-Punk and Indian Spider-Man.,2023-06-02
Same exact experience at a an AMC prime theater in California - seems like it’s less a theater thing and more a mixing thing.,2023-06-02
It was super quiet in my theater too!,2023-06-02
"Same issue.

I'm from Argentina LOL",2023-06-02
"I could not hear Gwen’s opening at all. Then when the title happened, audio sounded fine",2023-06-02
I could barely hear as well and it didn't help when half of the audience was laughing their asses off while they're talking,2023-06-02
Same issue in my theater.,2023-06-02
"Thought this was just me, saw it in imax and had the same problem",2023-06-02
Regular theater or Dolby Cinema theater? I had problems hearing dialog watching in a Dolby Cinema theater.,2023-06-02
"Same at Cinemark in Colorado. The entire mix for the entirely movie sounded really off. Still was incredible - it’s just that the first movie has such an incredible soundtrack/mixing, it threw me off.",2023-06-02
No problems with Cinemark XD tonight.,2023-06-02
Yes! It was very noticeable for the first 10 minutes. Hoping they fix it for future showings,2023-06-02
Wasn't just you I was wondering if the sound was off because I opted for a regular theater showing and not the big fancy sound system one,2023-06-02
"Went to the first showing here in Brisbane, Australia. Music was loud but definitely not so loud that I couldn't catch the dialogue. Although I did go to one of the better cinemas (Event).",2023-06-02
i don’t even live in your country and it was the same for me,2023-06-02
I noticed the same. Went to see it at a new theater's grand opening. It had Dolby Atmos  and I thought maybe they still needed to tweak their audio a bit for the dialogue.  Sounds like their audio system is probably fine.,2023-06-02
Did you go to a cinemark?,2023-06-02
"Yea my theatre in Dallas, TX was definitely low as well",2023-06-02
"I’m glad I’m not the only one, I legit thought I might’ve gone deaf or need to get my hearing checked.",2023-06-02
Im glad I Wasn’t the only one who noticed it even when the movie began with Gwen playing her drums then after that the dialogue seemed super low.,2023-06-02
"I'm from Argentina, had to watch it with the Spanish dub and this was also an issue.",2023-06-02
"Omg I assumed it was my theatre, the whole first like 10 minutes was mixed so badly. How on earth did this pass screenings",2023-06-03
Totally had the same issue at an Alamo Drafthouse. Seems like there was something up with the mix for sure.,2023-06-03
Yeah the Spider people do a lot of quipping and talking while in the middle of fighting. Will have to watch this again with subtitles.,2023-06-03
Yup I though the sound mixing was off aswell,2023-06-03
I rewatched into the Spiderverse last night and I thought the same thing. I was hoping it wouldn’t happen in this one too but it definitely did. Going to have to wait for home release with subtitles.,2023-06-03
I can confirm that the audio in my theatre was mad quiet as well,2023-06-04
Saw it in Dolby and it was not bad and my left ear sucks. I don’t do imax.,2023-06-07
Sounded really good in Dolby,2023-06-08
"The movie just came out this weekend in Japan, and I watched it in English with japanese subtitles, and the diolouge audio was surprisingly loud over the action.",2023-06-18
"Same here in a MI theater. Audio was definitely high enough cause some of the peaks hurt my ears, but I still couldn't hear Gwen at the beginning over the music. I think the music was just mixed too loud compared to the voices on the final cut sent to theaters.",2023-07-10
"real, in a very pretty movie she was one of the prettiest parts of it",2023-06-02

"""I thought all Spider-Men are supposed to be funny; why aren't you funny Miguel?"" That got a laugh from me. Great movie, so well done",2023-06-03
I really think it'll overtake Nolans trilogy. The thing about Nolan's is that we never saw the real 3rd movie but a weaker version instead. This Spiderverse trilogy won't suffer from that and will likely stick the landing.,2023-06-05
I like that they're very careful (for the most part) to not have a Whedon-esque quip completely derail or undermine serious or dramatic moments. Spider-Man famously won't shut up so it's neat to see a tasteful balance of jokes and stakes especially in this IP,2023-06-06

Nahhh I don't think he's gonna be a Spider person who dies. It's gonna be Pavitr. Dude is very chill about being Spider-Man and an event that would have likely made him take the job more seriously and knock him down a peg didn't happen. He's gonna get too confident and pay for it,2023-06-03
"I'm thinking they'll have a fake-out death for Gwen. They sort of set it up with her saying that in basically every dimension but hers Gwen falls in love with Spider-Man but doesn't have it end well for her. I can totally see it seem like a ""canon moment"" (ASM121, presumably) is about to happen, make it appear that Gwen has died, and then pull the rug out to show she's alive and the universe is fine and that the stuff eating away at the multiverse actually isn't due to what Miguel thinks.",2023-06-03

"The Donald Glover/Miles Morales history is fun, but a little more complicated

In 2010, Sony announced they were rebooting the Spider-Man movies. People on Twitter campaigned for Donald Glover to play Peter (#Donald4SpiderMan). Andrew Garfield got cast, but as a reference, Community season 2 opens with Glover's character in Spider-Man pajamas.

Brian Michael Bendis, the writer of Ultimate Spider-Man, saw that episode of Community, and it was part of the inspiration for him to create Miles Morales. Included in the comic origin is that his uncle Aaron Davis is the Ultimate universe's version of the Prowler.

Then seven years later, Glover is cast in Spider-Man: Homecoming as Aaron Davis, with his Prowler codename referenced. He mentions a nephew, and in a deleted post-credits gag, calls him Miles by name over the phone.

Now here we are with Donald Glover, as MCU(?) Aaron Davis, sharing a screen with the Oscar-winning animated version of Miles Morales, a character inspired by him.",2023-06-02

I was a little confused because I thought it was VERY clear that he was going to earth 42 so I thought the whole reveal took way too long. As soon as they showed it on the computer I told my friend he’s going to the wrong earth and they got mad at me for pointing it out so early on lol,2023-06-02
The Son Heung-Min poster out a huge smile on my face. Hopefully the player in that universe racked up the club silverware his talent deserves.,2023-06-02
Funny enough the movie does tell you when Miles gets scanned that he’s going to Universe 42 and not 1610! But I was still surprised because the movie and it’s pacing made me forget in that moment!,2023-06-02

"unless it was a mistype, he very clearly mentions his \*nephew\*, so, Miles, in Homecoming. So people weren't assuming Miles, they were assuming he was his uncle.",2023-06-02

"This comment has been edited, and the account purged, in protest to Reddit's API policy changes, and the awful response from Reddit management to valid concerns from the communities of developers, people with disabilities, and moderators.

I had that very thought too. Glad I'm not alone in this.,2023-06-05
"This exactly. 

Miguel is majorly projecting his unprocessed grief in the form of anger at Miles; superficially, blaming him for being an anomaly, when he's angry that his anomalous status might mean he gets to keep his family intact when Miguel lost an entire universe trying at the same thing.",2023-06-04
"Late to the party, but I think it's pretty clear that the whole canon event thing is BS anyway (at least the idea that destroying one unwravels the multiverse, or something).

We've seen two canon event disruptions, but they look \_nothing alike\_.  Miguel's disruption had the rainbow triangles associated with the Alchemax collider, whereas Pavitr's had the black splotches associated with the Spot.  I've got to assume that neither of these things had anything to do with the canon event or I would expect to them to look at least somewhat similar.",2023-06-20
"I think the point he was making was the canon event not happening would crumble the universe and by extension put the multiverse in danger. How that event affects the spider-man involved is irrelevant, so imprisoning miles means nothing. His claimed target is protecting the universe to maintain the multiverse, not Mile’s character development.",2023-06-04
TBH why would she be doing any of this while pregnant? Does Miguel not believe in maternity leave?,2023-06-02

"What if Spot uses his power to pull out the unborn fetus from her womb?

That would be evil, I think.",2023-06-02
I'd say less than 10% he'll likely just be named Gerry like in the comics,2023-06-02

"And just to add on, the opening monologue  begins with her not having friends aside from Lizard-Peter and Miles, then ends with her realizing she was wrong and recruiting the gang from the first one + a few more. Really nice way to tie the intro and end together, while emphasizing the no-friends thing was just her warped perspective from her trauma.",2023-06-02
"Completely agree. Gwen gets a satisfying resolution with her dad. 

I also knew this was pt1 before going in, which really allowed me to accept it before watching. Giving miles and gang the extended runtime to slow down and give those big character moments was a great choice. 

Under a year till the next one too. I’m all in.",2023-06-02
"Agreed, just a very well-crafted film from the bones out. Lord and Miller have their prankster ""make it up as we go"" reputation, but everything I've seen from them gives me the impression that the thing they value most is solidity and sound structure.

It also helps that everyone except Gwen has amazing character animation, while Gwen has ""I didn't realize this was possible"" character animation. Just incredible stuff.",2023-06-02
"I agree that the cliffhanger feels like we're just getting \*more\*. Miles and Gwen both had full arcs about growing as a person, accepting who and what they are and the choices they're going to have to make, and had to grow up a bit. But instead of Miguel just seeing he could be wrong and Miles is right, we're set up for \*even more\* of the series in a way that felt built up to and earned.

We've seen Miles at his start, at his lowest so far, at his highest so far, and now we get to see the darkest version of him and him have to confront that he could be that.",2023-06-03
It felt like part 2 of 3 for me.,2023-06-02
"Yeah. For a movie that ended on a cliffhanger, it felt strangely ""complete"". I wish the next part was coming out sooner than next year LOL. But I don't feel disappointed in how this one flowed from beginning to end. And Gwen kinda being the deuteragonist definitely helped.",2023-06-03
"I feel like it would’ve been better if they bookended the movie on both sides with Gwen’s resolution, but I can see how that would be narratively clunky.",2023-06-04
"I think another thing that helped make it not feel cheap too is that this movie OOZES with love and passion. So I personally did not tire of it and only wanted more because of that and it's ending felt more like a ""please give us time for a little more, we can't have you in here for ~5 hours"".",2023-06-07

I also dont remember his spidey sense ever going off during any of this.",2023-06-02
"Also Miguel is the massive hypocrite. He himself is a walking anomaly. And what he did in his backstory was exactly the same as what Kingpin was trying to do

I get that the whole thing is him trying to fix/atone but he was being a massive dick projecting/trauma dumping on Miles.",2023-06-03
"The spider was taken from earth-42, meaning Peter never got bit, so no Spider-Man in that universe.

Miles got bit in his universe, which caused his Peter to die by saving him. If Miles never got  bit, he would have never went back underground to check on the Spider that bit him.",2023-06-02
"It’s a really interesting twist on the “evil Spider-Man”/symbiote storylines we’ve seen in the past, with a true alternate trajectory for Miles in Earth-42. Cannot wait to see how it plays out.",2023-06-02
it kinda confirmed majority miles morales are probably villains in multiverse and miles being 1st anomaly is deja vu he also technically made spot canon event u cant change inverrisable damage done,2023-06-02
"Do we know for sure the prowler is bad? I'm still half expecting to find out that he's a hero in that universe, just a darker character overall bc of the timeline. The sinister six cartels in the background also made it seem like he might be battling them.",2023-06-04
"I think his take points to Miguel leading the spider society and that's why they're like the bad guys because Miguel is. Miguel is the original anomaly, he was the prowler in his universe and requires injections to prevent glitching and points miles out as a scapegoat to keep everyone from seeing its all him. He killed spiderman and lied about being him.

Parallel to that the spot thinks miles is the bad guy for taking everything from him. He blames miles for becoming spiderman except miles is not responsible for the spider finding and biting him.

The spot is peter Parker in universe 42 and blames mile morales because Miguel went to that universe to replace his family and stopped Peter from becoming spiderman, and found out he doesn't exist as the prowler there. Destroys the collider so he can go to another universe and try again and creates the spot, framing miles, maybe even kills his dad, sealing miles-42 as prowler.",2023-06-19

Great movie, but this was definitely a bummer. Most of the theatre gasped at the ""To Be Continued"" lmao. One pre-teen kid called it a scam... which is relatable tbh. 😂

Beautiful movie in both story and visuals, no doubt. They did a great job of world building for Beyond the Spider-verse and gave the developments needed. But, oh man, it just left me wanting more.",2023-06-04

I really hope they don't have Holland as an actual live action character in the next movie.

Honestly hoping they got all the live action stuff out of their system and Beyond will be 100% animated,2023-06-02
"While I definitely think Sony and Disney are in a great spot right now, I think the only tangible thing here is the visual representation of the multiverse, which definitely is directly from the MCU, so wonder how that worked out. 

As for some of the other stuff, Sony doesn’t need a lot of permission to do what they did here. They have full and final creative control over Spider-Man. 

One of the directors mentioned previously that the Doctor Strange reference is just a fun Easter egg in name only. It’s likely they didn’t need their permission to name drop him in that instance. Probably similar to how Deadpool 2 kept name dropping Marvel/DC characters, Eternals named dropped Batman and Superman, or how they say Captain Marvel in Shazam 2. If it’s just a small thing, they can just say it. 

For Donald Glover, they definitely don’t need Marvel’s permission to bring him back and use him how they see fit. They didn’t need Marvel’s permission to teleport Keaton’s Adrian Toomes to the Morbiverse. 

Besides the direct visual reference to the branching timeline, I’d say the biggest thing to take comfort in regarding their relationship is the multi-year deal that’s finally active that brings Sony content to Disney+.",2023-06-02

I really thought the film was going to end right when Miles teleports to Earth-42, and I was almost upset because they showed a lot of the spider-society stuff in the trailers. Honestly wish I avoided them for this one because they gave away too much IMO, but they played it at every movie I went to for months lol

Yes there are complete arcs and a second viewing will probably help but I agree that it kind of just ends. Ends with a good hook for sure though.

"By splitting it in half they are giving it a 2-act structure and now we just have a looooong intermission. If they cut it at the midpoint properly, we've seen the intro and half of it climbing action, back time we get the climax and resolution.

2-act structure generally ends the first act with a false victory and a change in status quo before leading into a different in tone act 2 (usually darker bc that's where the climax happens). That fits in here, which makes sense considering it was originally one big movie that got split in half during development. This movie will definitely be elevated even further with a double screening with Beyond.",2023-06-02

It's one thing to end the movie on a scene that makes you say ""Oh shit, what's going to happen?"" and another thing to end the movie in the middle of a scene.

Movie’s like UP, Shrek trilogy, Ice Age, Madagascar. All silly movies that come off as childish but have clear adult jokes, and themes that adults get a kick out of. And this isn’t even including more mature animation films. Like buddy below me said anything from Miller or Lord make that clear enough and plenty more. 

No hate, nor a dig just trying to say this movie isn’t doing anything special as far as that medium. Just seems to be this thing that anytime an Animated film that comes out that is mature always have people coming out the wood work saying things like this. When it’s like “bro we get it, it’s been done”

It's one of the cornerstones of Spider-verse's style and one of the best things it does. For a long time people questioned 3D animation's ability to do heavy stylization and Spider-verse playing with different framerates is part of that. One of my favorite examples from the first movie is that when Miles and Peter are swinging away from the Alchemax facility, Peter is moving at 24fps (on 1s) and is smoother than Miles, who moves at 12fps (on 2s) to show his inexperience compared to Peter.",2023-06-02

">The audio mix was bad though, did anyone else experience that? It was really quiet for some reason and I struggled to hear dialogue.

I saw it again today in a smaller theater without Dolby surround sound and I figured it out. They have all the voiceover dialogue coming from straight ahead in the soundscape. That is, if you were wearing quality headphones, the dialogue would sound like it's coming from the direction of the screen. 

Consequently, in the theater, only the very front speakers above and below the screen play the audio. Since most of the seating is closer to the big surround sound speakers along the sides, the center/front gets drowned out.

In the smaller theater without Dolby I could hear the dialogue just fine, and once it comes out digitally it'll be a really cool stylistic choice for the audio design. Bummer that it had that effect in the theater, though.",2023-06-07

"*Miguel is wrong about the need of canon events to occur for the health and continued existence of the multiverse.
It's not the death, it's the lessons learned from that. And Miles is going to learn them in a different way.*

That's just your comment, slightly rearranged. What you're describing is exactly the point they're trying to make, but Miguel is not gonna be proven right in part 2. There's a line midway through the movie where Gwen asks ~""Are you SURE breaking the canon will destroy the Spiderverse?"" and rather than saying yes, he replies ""Do you want to find out!?""

The whole point of Miles Morales is that **anyone can be Spiderman**, and ""canon events"" aren't what make him Spiderman",2023-06-07

">I don’t like how all of the Spider-People are so quick to side with Miguel. Spider-Man is a hero that stands-up for the little guy and always tries to save every person. It doesn’t make sense to me that Miles is the only Spider-Person to hold this ideology.

Lots of spoilers ahead, so even though this is a spoilers allowed thread, I'll spoiler tag some of it

First off, there's selection bias. These are the spiders who were chosen to be part of Miguel's strike force across literally infinite universes. There may have been plenty who were never recruited or quit because they wouldn't go along with his plan.

>!And several of them do side with Miles. Gwen gets together a whole little gang at the end to back him up. The one spider lady could have stopped Miles' escape by rebooting the system like Miguel asked her to, when the robot was sending him home, but she refused. Spiderpunk peaced out early. Peter B Parker refused to help catch Miles, and I don't know how seriously a lot of the other Spidermen were really trying to catch him. They seemed suspiciously unmotivated/unable to keep up with Miles, than you'd expect for superpowered spidermen.!<

Also, keep in mind that in universe this is literally 15 minutes after >!Miles stopped a ""canon event"" to save Captain Singh, and a universe devouring quantum black hole appeared. That definitely makes Miguel's case way more credible, that he's not just being paranoid or controlling. When you've seen billions of innocents die, like these Spidermen are implied to have, you have to take it seriously. !<

>!Finally, none of the Spidermen were watching civilians die at that moment, they were just letting Miguel imprison Miles. I would wager many of them wanted to confront Spot themselves as a group, and see how things unfold before deciding their course. And Miles was a dangerous anomaly wildcard - he's literally a spiderman that's not supposed to exist in any dimension - they wanted off the table so they could handle the situation. !<

>!That doesn't prove all the Spiderman would have been willing to just let the civilians die, when the time came for Spot's attack. After all, they were all furiously fighting to take Spot down in Pavitr's universe and stop him absorbing Collider energy, not just Miles. !<

Given all the circumstances, I could see why its not OOC for many of the spider men refusing to free Miles in the situation. And I don't think there's necessarily as many of them unreservedly on Miguel's side as it appears at first either.",2023-06-04

"I'm with you. As an art form its an absolute masterpiece but I was gonna puke by the end if I heard anything more about being a parent. I don't mind emotional scenes but jeez it was getting a bit too much every other scene being a confrontation with parents or something like that.

Incredibles 2 did the same thing and completely lost the vibe of their first movies. Overall I liked the first movie better. I felt like this movie reallly slowed down after the first fight scene until the HQ scene",2023-06-04

"agreed, don't see how people are saying this is better than the first. when that one had pitch perfect pacing and a great story.",2023-06-03
"I don't necessarily agree that a three plot structure is needed. The movie opens with Gwen narrating Miles story and ends with her recruiting Spider-People to help save him. The whole movie kind of acts like Gwen telling Miles' story, both to her new ""band"" and the audience as it wrestles with what Canon is and what it does for Spider-Man as a character. Miles not wanting to conform to the Canon was a nice continuation of his struggle with living up to the Spider-Man he wants to be instead of doing his own thing.",2023-06-03
"I agree with you regarding plot (graphics is fine… it’s a pretty movie with lots of eye candy). The core story is the same old one man against the world story. And you know Miles will win at the end because he’s got plot armour and not because he’s right — as audience we are not given enough information yet to determine if he’s right. But you know there’ll be a plot twist somewhere in the next movie … just when everything seems lost, and Miles start doubting if his decision was too selfish or stupid, something miraculous would happen and save the day. I feel almost tired just thinking about watching the next movie. 

If this wasn’t a movie Miles’ quest would have likely been questioned and tested numerous times (are all the other spider entities zombies?), and proven impossible. Maybe he could still try, but at what cost? The whole Spider-Man thing is about power and responsibility. 

I imagine if I had liked the characters enough I’d be interested to find out “how” they accomplish the impossible. None of the interactions between the characters seem real to me. As breathtaking as some of the scenes are, in the end the characters’ speeches are just a collection of cliches (including the parents). You have some nice stereotypes who are funny, cute and very visually appealing but that doesn’t make them human.",2023-06-11
"The only fanservice was all the cameos when Miles first went to the Spider Society and some more when they explain canon. I watched the films back to back and I think this one has more poses because Miles and Peter B. Parker only got their shit together at the end of the first film. The skilled characters posed all the time.

I agree about the three act structure not being there. The movie basically opens with a short film about Gwen, too. Didn't bother me, though.",2023-06-03
"I mean a major plot point is a pretty blatant critique of repetitive unimaginative storytelling with the whole ""breaking canon"" aspect. So kind of makes sense for the movie to subvert standard 3 act structure. Now I understand that being different to just be different isn't always good. In the end this movie did follow pretty standard 2nd movie of a trilogy ending. The ending is very similar in style to The Empire Strikes Back.


And if you look at the movie as Gwen's movie it has a more typical ark. The movie even starts in Gwen. She has conflict with her father, runs away from home and finds a new ""family"" when Miles comes into the fold she has to choose between her new ""family"" and her friend. She is able to find her way. Make amends with her father and realizes she chooses Miles.",2023-08-10
"Iirc Miguel's universe was a one off and didn't affect other realities. 

I'm Miles's case, his being bitten led to his Peter Parker dying, which led to Kingpin activating his collider which is what led to the sudden spike in anomalies. If Miles wasn't there its assumed that Peter stops Kingpin that first night.

Of course we don't know if Miguel is being upfront about all of his intentions but that's how it's presented.",2023-06-02

This movie is anything but a cash grab. Sony basically gave endless leash to Phil Lors and Chris Miller to make this movie including a $100M budget for this first part and like 5 years to make it. I think they truly wanted this to be too parts. Frankly I can't think of more than like 10 minutes I'd want cut from this movie if they had to cut stuff (and that would make it feel rushed) so it's the right choice.

"I think you're kind of missing the point on Miles, for lack of a better term, ""coming out"" to his mom.  The emotional character arc wasn't about his parents knowing or not knowing (that was more Gwen's arc), it was about him growing into the confidence and self assuredness to own his identity as Spider-Man and not need to keep it a secret.  It was a person vs. self style conflict that was resolved before the rug was pulled out from under him.  He got the emotional payoff because the conflict wasn't about what his parents were going to say, it was a self acceptance conflict which was in contrast with Gwen where she didn't have much of a choice to tell her father.  Her emotional arc was in learning to confront that with him.  Miles was resolving something within himself, Gwen was resolving something with another person.  They're contextually similar conflicts, but different in a storytelling sense",2023-06-02

"Also most of the anomalies have been people from other universes stopping canon events from happening or popping into another universe, but what happens if someone from their own universe stops a canon event from happening? I don’t think it would break the web.

Gwen’s actions made her dad quit the force and that didn’t have any lasting consequences on her world so I think there are more options Miguel isn’t seeing because he’s been blinded by his grief of losing his daughter from another universe",2023-06-04
"Wow that's a great way of putting it. And actually your comment actually made me rethink some of Gwen's lines and her perspective through the film. I brain dumped it here, maybe this was obvious to others but your line about 'you think you know the rest' made it click for me:

In her opening monologue, Gwen says 'You think you know the rest. I thought I knew the rest.' and at the end she says to Miles' parents 'One thing I've learned from Miles: It's all possible.' At first these seem like trite cliches but in fact they make sense in the context of what she discovers throughout the film from Miles.

At the beginning of the film, Gwen leaves her father after she reveals her identity and he fails to accept her. She feels hopeless: 'I don't know how to fix this', and runs away. After joining the spider society, she evidently comes to accept that she needs to let her father die when he becomes a police captain. When the Spider Verse is being explained to Miles, he asks her 'What about your father? Isn't he about to be captain?' and she cannot manage to say anything but '... Yeah'.

Why would she accept this? Well all the other Spiders have resigned to it, including those she looks up to and counts as her friends. In the same scene, we see that Peter was with Miguel when Miguel failed to save his new world and his daughter disappeared in his arms: 'If you break enough cannon, save enough captains... you could lose it all. Isn't that right Peter?' Again, Peter cannot bring himself to say anything but 'Yeah.' He must have said the same thing to Gwen at some point. All the other Spiders seem resigned in their own way, even Hobie the anarchist's response is evasion and denial: 'What of it?' What else was Gwen supposed to do?

So what changes when Miles arrives? He can't give up: 'You can't ask me not to save my own father.' -- 'I'm not asking.' At first even Gwen is not on his side (although she argues against locking him up by force), only Hobie is ('use the palms'). We see her confliction in the chase sequence. Jess says: 'I know he's your friend, but it's the only way' -- 'But my gut says' -- 'Then use your head'. This conflict also explains even better why Gwen couldn't explain things to Miles: 'You knew?... You all knew?' -- 'I didn't know... how to explain it to you.' On top of not being allowed to (and not even being allowed to visit him) she could barely admit it to herself, so how could she explain it to him?

And finally, when Miles escapes Gwen begins to come around to his perspective: 'Do you know what happens if you break the cannon?' -- 'Do you want to find out?' Even when the others don't back her up: 'Peter wanna back me up on this one?' -- 'Well ok, as the father of a daughter and the son of a mother -' and 'You're wrong! Jess, tell him he's wrong.' -- 'He's... not.' -- 'Are you serious right now?', she is resolved: 'Well I'm not coming.' -- 'You're right.' -- 'What?'.

And what specifically happened that made her realise 'it's all possible'? When she came out fully to her father: 'I tried so hard to wear this mask like you would want me too.' and her father decides to quit: 'Then arrest me dad!' -- 'I... can't.' -- 'Why not?' -- 'Because I quit.' And importantly he hadn't decided to quit while Gwen was missing: 'What? When?' Gwen appears confused because this is not how things are meant to go, it's not how the cannon is meant to go -- 'About half way through your big speech.' Between Gwen and her father this is the moment when they reconcile, but for Gwen specifically it's one more thing. She realises that she doesn't have to give up on her father dying, and she never did.

This is what Miles gave her that no one else did in the Spider society. Her finally sticking up for Miles is (in a bit of a round about way) what got her sent home and what got her to reconcile with her father. And by reconciling with her father and him quitting, she realises she can save him after all, thanks to Miles' conviction -- no super powers or super strength required. Like she said at the beginning of the film 'You think you know the rest. I thought I knew the rest.' But she doesn't and no one does.",2023-06-06
"They had her section of the frame painted in cool tones and her dad's end at the door in an inviting warm light and when they hugged the colors bled through into both spaces.

"> the stupid Spider therapy scene was in bad taste and mocks something many of us who are either in or need therapy. It wasn't funny it was insulting.

I think it's mocking the fact that everyone is so overly familiar with the Spider-Man origin story by now rather than people in therapy in general. As someone who's used therapy before and seen it help others I'm really struggling to see the personal attack.",2023-06-05
"Definitely not bloated with fanservice. If you were to say that for No Way Home, I could somewhat see your point but even then “bloated” is a strong and wrong word choice. 

I don’t really see what u can trim down in the movie. Maybe some Gwen solo scenes to make it more concise but I thought the pacing was masterful. The movie didn’t drag at all and the 2hr 20min runtime went by like a breeze. 

I don’t really think there was that much exposition dumping. Some parts sure because it’s necessary sometimes but for the most part they balanced show don’t tell well enough. Only part they didn’t was the beginning Mom and Miles rooftop scene but that was still a touching mom and son moment. 

The cliffhanger ending was much better than I thought. It sucks it had to end there but it could have ended at a way more blue balls spot. They could have ended it right when miles and the audience realized that the earth miles went to wasn’t his home and that would have been an even more cliffhanger ending. 

“If you can’t tell a complete story in three hours you’re doing it wrong” I’m sorry but prior to this I was at least able to respect ur opinions but this is probably the dumbest opinion I’ve seen on r/movies. 

Yes, because all directors/filmmakers aim to do shit similarly all the time and always /s. If you want a self contained movie just go watch the first one again. If they did another self contained story again, people would compare it way more critically against the first since it would appear similar to the first. This was the best course of action for a sequel. It doesn’t detract or take away from the first one. It builds upon the universe and continues the story in logical ways that make sense to all the characters motivations. 

Were you just not aware this is a part 1 movie? Infinity war is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time and is a golden standard for superhero storytelling and is also a part 1. I’m tired of the 95%+ of superhero films building up the villain and killing/defeating them within the same single film. It’s lazy and predictable and completely waters down the respective stories. 


You say it’s a mess but it was pretty easy to follow in terms of story and narrative. It’s pretty obvious considering the start of the film that this movie is about Gwen’s character development as much as it is the new conflicts and Miles. It didn’t just jump around. Each scene transition made logical sense relative to the story and the settings. 

I’m depressed and have been to therapy. It was a lighthearted scene and you’ve got to be really embedded in cognitive distortions such as black and white thinking to think that it was in bad taste. 


Idk, the only real solid critique you offered was the sound mixing. Unlike with Reddit’s opinion on tenet’s sound design and mixing, this movie actually had poor mixing which was the only real flaw. 

I think you’ve got to learn how to have fun in life. 
The funny thing is hearing your remark about “if you can’t tell a complete story in three hours you’re doing it wrong” makes me think you’re like Miguel Spiderman 2088 because he tries to conform to “societal (in this case multiversal) rules.” In filmmaking there are no rules. Only decisions and planning. This movie is art. Nothing less.",2023-06-05

"Gwen does mention that most of the Spider Society are just part timers.  I imagine they show up for the occasional crossover event, but spend 99% of their time in their own universe.

I think the idea is that Canon Events are inevitable, aside from interference from other universes.  Even if Pavitr was told in advance, he wouldn't have been able to stop it by himself.

Since Mile's very existence breaks Canon, I think they treat his events differently.  Other than that, they know Spot is a multiversal threat, and will need to get involved anyways.  I suppose Miguel thought that Miles would get in the way trying to save his dad while they dealt with Spot.",2023-06-12

Movies need to continue to let the audience know there won't be resolution, i'm not sure why they're moving away from that. I just saw a movie released last month that did this as well. I'm perfectly fine with stories spanning multiple movies but imo expectations should be set ahead of time.",2023-06-09

"> While all the above has to do with Miles, I found Gwen's arc weirdly disappointing in that her father's reversal from wanting to arrest her at the beginning to turning in his badge, was not adequately explored and I do feel they should have spent more time there establishing how that reversal came about. As we see Gwen rounding out her rag-tag team of Spiderpeople at the end, instead of feeling like this was a tight-knit team that had each other's back and will pose a considerable challenge to Miles' foes, it did not sit well with me. The great characters we see in Into The Spiderverse are only revisited at the very end here, which seems like a lost opportunity to have had a few scenes with them early on in this movie as well, so that we see them interact with each other and get the sense that the closing team-up is earned.

I agree, Gwen's arc was rushed, from her band arc, to her father arc. People seem to love it but it's seems they only care about how pretty her world colors look, but not thinking about how her arc writing was rushed. I'm happy the main arc with Miles with his mom, dad, villains and Gwen was not rushed. We will get the right character development for Miles with his villains, family and possible lover Gwen.",2023-06-09
"I had the same thought about Miles’ age. He seemed 15 in the first movie. With his height and demeanor, they easily could’ve made him 17 and not changed anything else.

They're trying to save worlds and people are bringing children with them, going off-mission and doing random shit, and acting like little jackasses.

Yeah I hate to be a contrarian seeing as everyone is gushing about the movie, but even after the reveal that Miles needs to let his f\_cking father die to preserve a timeline, Peter from the first movie still treats the whole thing like its no big deal and is quipping it up with his baby, cracking jokes to Miles like its no big deal etc, and all the other Spidermen are like uhh why is this kid so bothered that his father is gonna die in 2 days jeez, was strange",2023-06-05

> Why did I watch the university conflicts between Miles and his family, does that contribute to the movie?

Very good point. The plot is kinda all over the place, there's no real central conflict. The real conflict actually arrives in the last minutes of the movie which is insane when you think about it. This is why I think you're spot on when you say that you felt like watching a 2.5-hour-long trailer.

So many of these plot points could have been shown and not told.",2023-06-07

Off the top of my head, the Spot decided to become a major villain because he wasn't being treated seriously by someone he (wrongly) assumed to be his arch nemesis. Miles didn't go invisible during the chase because he *wanted* to be chased, thereby drawing the other Spiders away from the Go Back machine. Spot needed another particle collider, specifically, because it was a collider that gave him his powers and he wanted to get stronger. The Spiders *tried* to stop the falling building and, when they couldn't, went into overdrive mode to save as many people as they could. A lot of these points were *explicitly* explained in the film itself.

As to the central conflict, everyone knows that changing established history is bad...that isn't the problem. Miguel is telling Miles that he can't or shouldn't stop something that *hasn't happened yet.* Which, of course, Miles disagrees with.

"The exact rules of ""canon events"" aren't strongly defined, yet. I think that's by design.

Like does preventing canon events directly cause reality to unravel itself? Like Miguel's explanation kind of implies it does but Miles said the event was caused by the spot, so I have a feeling the explanation will end up being that every prevention of a canon event happened to be accompanied by a cataclysmic event, and one doesn't necessitate the other.

Also, the spot causes the canon event for Indian Spider-Man (which is then prevented) but the spot itself is an anomaly resulting from the anomalous existence of Miles. So clearly anomalies can play a part in producing canon events.

But at the end of the day, we can speculate about the details of the lore, but what actually matters is the themes expressed through the story. I feel like this idea of canon events that have to happen, as well as the obvious interpretation about fate and self-determination, is also a meta commentary of the comic book industry/fandom that insists certain things have to always be true and there can be no permanent change in the status quo.",2023-06-05

The comedy was fun, the characters were interesting, I enjoyed a lot of the plot.

The pacing felt off to me. We spent a lot of time on things that didn't seem to matter and lots of it felt stretched out. I wouldn't have minded this as much if the movie had concluded wholly, but as is, it feels like sand in the wound.

Some of the characters really ground my gears. The obsurd and whacky characters took a back seat in the previous film and that worked so well. In this one, they take more of a mainstage and I felt it undercut a lot of the stakes early on. I also just found their personalities a bit abrasive.

You need to watch the first movie again. I agree with most of what you said but this stuck out to me. It was basically his entire arc in the last movie. 

He started out being incredibly annoyed by miles and wanting to get rid of him as quickly as possible but slowly started to take pride in mentoring him and teaching him the ropes of being spiderman. Near the beginning he says, ""this is why i didn't have kids"" when miles was trying to guilt him into taking him with him for the trip. Then at the end he tells Miles, ""I'm so proud of you!

"I couldn't agree more. There are plenty of examples of ""part 1"" movies that have satisfying stories. 

Infinity War is a very good example. Dune: Part 1 is another one. Even Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 felt like it gave us enough substance to be okay with the first part. These movies did it well because even though they left the story up in the air, they left off at a natural stopping point.

Across the Spider-Verse didn't end at a natural stopping point. It ended in the middle of a bunch of plot points and robbed the movie of a real climax. I feel like they made this movie worse for the sake of the next movie.

When I think about what makes a good cliffhanger and what makes a bad cliffhanger, a good one gives you a little bit of closure but then also gives you some mystery to look forward to. A bad cliffhanger takes what would have been the normal ending and makes that the carrot on the stick to get you to come back. And I feel like this movie was more the latter.

This movie's ending felt more akin to that of ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" to me, which is not a favourable comparison.",2023-06-07

The other Spider folk couldn't be counted on. That's why he worked up the courage to tell his ""mom"" his big secret at the end. 

But the twist is he sees this fun house mirror, tormented version of himself in the universe his own super spider came from. This means he can no longer necessarily even *trust himself*. I think what he's going to learn is what he could become if he goes alone and doesn't build a true community with other heroes. 

So the stakes aren't about the physical battle with Miles Prowler. It's about evolving the lesson he learned from this film into knitting together a web with fallible other people to become the best version of himself.",2023-06-02

They probably know that certain actions can cause a universe collapse, and some might have even seen it. But not necessarily what they are.

He was confused when a bunch of spider people were there to contain the quantum hole. It is obviously that he didnt know anything about canon event stuff. You dont know what a canon event is, you most likely cant stop it. (If ""canon events"" is a real thing)
The other questions may not have definite answers for them because there is not enough information to conclude anything.",2023-07-04
">If the whole Spot thing is ""not canon"" then why was the Indian captain supposed to die there?

I think the way it works is that dimensions have 'scripts' where, ultimately, it's the outcome that matters, not the journey. So even if the Inspector Singh was killed directly by Spot, it would still count as a canon event as far as the dimensional rules are concerned. 

>Why did they even bother going to the Indian's spiderman's world in the first place? If they did manage to stop the Spot in time then the captain wouldn't have been in danger either, thus he wouldn't need to be saved. Thus, causing an anomaly. This whole ordeal makes 0 sense to me.

They went to Pav's world because Spot was there. If they managed to capture him before he caused the Alchemax building to fall over Mumbattan, I expect it would simply delay Inspector Singh's death to another time, thus fixing the anomaly. 

>If Miles is an anomaly, then why is his universe not already on the verge of destruction like the Indian spiderman's universe is after saving the captain? Saving the Captain immediatly caused the world to almost to crubme. But Miles become Spiderman which was not supposed to happen has no effect on the intregry of the universe? Huh?

That's the big question here, and the biggest wrench in Miguel's canon event theory. I assume it'll be answered in the next movie, but for now, my theory is that Miguel is onto something with canon events, he's just being way, way too rigid with it. Dimensions can probably tolerate some degree of outside interference, and that degree varies from dimension to dimension. For example, with Pav's world, you had Miles glitching almost immediately after arriving, then destabilizing ~30 minutes after Spot's interference and interrupting a canon event. But if we assume MCU is directly tied to Spiderverse (""And don't even get me started on Dr. Strange and that little nerd from Earth-19999!""), you had a bunch of displaced villains running amok with no glitching whatsoever, then being sent back to their worlds 'cured' with no apparent ill effects on their world. 

>I find it incredibly hard to believe that all the Spidermen in that whole society are on board with letting certain people die just to preseve the ""cannon"".

Personally, I think Miguel specifically sought out Spidermen who aligned with his ideals. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, sort of deal. It's also a good way to ignore the fact that they could've saved their Uncle Bens, their Captain Stacys, etc. It's a tragedy that Miles has to lose his father, but it'll keep his dimension safe and hey, that's what it means to be Spiderman, right?",2023-07-09
He would have had the powers Miles got. IIRC the powers always come from the spider rather than the human,2023-07-01

"Neither Peter or Gwen are really *trying* to capture Miles throughout the chase sequence, they're just doing what they can to keep up and adjust along the way. At the start of it, they don't think Miles will be able to escape, so they're initially just trying to ask him to stop and talk things out. 

As the chase develops, they realize that Miles is actually doing pretty damn well, so they just need to keep up with Miguel and Jess. In the event that either of those 2 capture Miles, Gwen and Peter just wanna be there to make sure that Miles is safe and to try talking with him again. If Miles were to elude Jess/Miguel while Peter/Gwen kept up, then they would have tried asking him to talk again; they still wouldn't force him to do anything though.

When they're climbing the train, Gwen and Peter are starting to see just how unhinged Miguel has become. At this point, their priority is convincing Miguel to calm tf down so he doesn't hurt Miles and/or tell him things that they didn't want him to have to worry about (he's an anomaly, he doesn't belong, etc). When Miles jumps away and turns invisible, we see Gwen and Peter both look relieved because at this point Miles escaping is the best outcome for his safety and well-being.",2023-07-07
"I mean, at the end of the day, everyone IS entitled to their own opinions. Sure, this movie doesn't give us a conclusion on the storylines of saving Miles' dad or Miles and Gwen's relationship, but that doesn't mean there wasn't any conclusion whatsoever so I'll give you my best shot. 

We start and end the movie with Gwen, getting to see her arc develop as she figures out more about who she is, what being Spider-Woman means to her, and how that affects her relationships with the people she cares about. We get to see her finally be accepted by her father and realize that even, though she did it with good intentions, keeping the truth from Miles wasn't the best way to help him. Gwen's struggles and what she learns from them are what drive her to do the right thing and start her own band to go and make things right.

Miles also has his own self realization by the end of the movie. He initially thought that he could never be whole without seeing his Spider friends again; thinking that he needed to be with them again to feel fulfilled and belong somewhere. After all of the events in Nueva York transpire, however, Miles realizes how strong he really is on his own. He is whole, he is enough, he is strong because of his family's love and support. With that affirmation he's no longer afraid to finally tell his parents the truth of who he is.

ATSV gives us a heavy focus on Miles and Gwen on their journeys of further self discovery while setting up plot points for the next movie. The story itself can have more focus in BTSV since we've already seen so much of our two protagonist's character development. Now in the next movie we can see how these more fleshed out characters face the challenges ahead of them. I think that's ultimately why people don't think ATSV has a satisfying conclusion, because the conclusion we do get is centered around character development rather than the plot itself.",2023-07-09
"The movie was actually meant to stand on its own. However, as they kept working on it the decision was made to split it into 2 parts to include everything that they wanted. If it was generally acceptable/profitable to release a 5-6 hour long movies they might've done that 🤷🏻‍♂️

"> Except, every spiderman obviously *tries* to save their universe's Captain, so Miles trying to save his own universe's Captain wouldn't even be a problem, he'd just fail.

The impression I got is that all the other Spider-people joined Miguel's team *after* their canon events have already happened. Since Miles now knows what's *supposed* to happen he can take steps to prevent it, which is an advantage/opportunity none of the other Spider-people had.

The Spider-people joining after their respective canon events have occurred also explains why they all agree with Miguel. It's hard to argue that certain events in your life are fated to happen once you meet hundreds--possibly thousands--of alternate versions of you who all had the same experiences.

Re: Mumbattan, I assume Miguel changes his mind because one, Miles now knows enough about the Spider-people that there's no longer a point in trying to hide details from him and two, the giant reality-eating hole that appears in Mumbattan presents Miguel with an opportunity to explain the concept of canon events and the consequences of altering one.

I imagine Miguel's hope at that point was that Peter B and Gwen would be able to talk sense into him. When that failed he went for plan B: trap him there and lead the Spider-people in fighting Spot, as a result of which the canon event--the death of Miles' dad--could occur uninterrupted",2023-06-04

"I dunno man, I think the premise of the main protagonist being right over one of the antagonists shouldn't come as a surprise, especially in a comic book movie.

The whole movie shows that Miles is right, that you can save the one person without destroying the universe. The inconsistency with how these 'canon events' happen plus the fate of Gwen's dad changing shows us this. If Miguel's interpretation of the 'canon' was to be believed, both Miles' universe and his spider's original universe should've collapsed long ago due to how drastically things changed.

This doesn't make Miguel experiences 'wrong', it doesn't mean his actions aren't justified from his point of view. But it's showing that he clearly didn't get the whole picture. He's come to a false conclusion based on his own traumatic experiences, which blind him from whatever the truth about the canon is.

Miles decision to run and to try and save his father makes complete sense. Why on earth would he just go ""ok guess I'll let my father die"" because some guy told him that? Miles isn't the guy to make some cold and calculating reasoning, doing so would be ridiculously out-of-character of him. It's essentially the trolley problem, but whereas most of the spider-people have resigned themselves to making the obvious binary choice of 1 person or a universe. Miles challenges that by essentially saying ""why does it have to be a choice in the first place?"". Having characters be driven by emotion is what makes them relatable and what makes the film great.",2023-06-07
multiverse trolley problem?,2023-06-07

"I think there are two ways where Miguel is mistaken though.

First of all. If Miles wasn’t supposed to be Spider-Man’s why is his father death a canon event? Maybe it isn’t. Maybe it doesn’t need to be.

Second of all if you notice when the universe where Miguel was was erased, he didn’t stop a canon event from happening. He went there and replaced the other dead Miguel. Miguel did die there. He just went there and took its place. So for the universe Miguel died, but for his family they never noticed. So maybe it was more that the universe was destroyed due to an incursion a la doctor strange.


Also makes me wonder… what happened to Miguel original universe? He just abandoned it?

Also why is that vision Peter B Parker there?",2023-06-07
"> So at the cost of 1 single person's life we should risk all of existence?

Miles isn't trying to just save his dad. He's trying to find a way to save his dad *and* the universe. Miguel won't even try. And in an infinite multiverse, Miguel is letting infinite people die by refusing to even try and find a way to save them, all because he's trying to make himself feel better by overcorrecting after his own attempt failed. Miguel *is* right only if you accept it at face value when he says there's no other way.

> But in order to take the second option you must pay the price of 1 life.

> What a cheap and low price. That's a steal. Almost literally!

Then they should tell the guy whose life is on the line to at least give him a chance to make an informed decision to self-sacrifice. They rescue innocent people, they're not supposed to sentence them.",2023-06-07
">Even though he's risking the destruction of a whole universe.

The more unhinged that Miguel the comes, the more you should realise to not be taking his word at face value. He could very easily either be lying, or simply misinformed about the true nature of why his universe collapsed. And that he turns to violence so quickly and readily shows how mentally unstable he is. It doesn't matter if the multiverse is at stake, Miguel isn't going to be the one who saves it. His martyr complex makes him think he's the only one capable, but he simply isn't responsible enough.

>So at the cost of 1 single person's life we should risk all of existence?

It's not one person. It's a lot of people. Miguel has established a society which excepts that some people must die in order for the universe to be right. That's not being the good guy, that's being a fascist. Spiderman is a hero, he saves people who are danger. He should not consign certain people to certain death, that is not something a hero does.

You're also taking the narrative very literally, at not viewing the metaphorical/metatextual reading of the scene. Miguel appealing to the sanctity of canon is a meta-textual analysis of Spiderman stories. That certain beats must happen, and that Spiderman cannot exist without tragedy. The scene doesn't exist to reconfirm these preconceptions, it challenges the viewer.  Do writers need to constantly need to re-use ideas to justify that they're telling an authentic Spiderman, or is the core identity of Spiderman about more than just plot details. Does Spiderman need trauma in order to exist? Do humans need trauma to find meaning? Is it ok to justify a traumatic society, just because someone says that it has to be that way? These are the kinds of questions you should be asking during that scene. You shouldn't be taking the Malthusian, fascist math's equation at face value.

The film's a two-parter. There's an entire movie left to disprove Miguel's fundamental assumption. But I already know that will happen, because the emotional context of the scene makes it clear that the viewer shouldn't be accepting what they are being told.",2023-06-07
"Miguel has the same logic that a nature documentary filmmaker has. If you see a rabid lion about to eat a beautiful gazelle, you don't step in. You let nature run its course. 

Miles would be stepping in and trying to feed both the lion and the gazelle in a way that doesn't involve murder. It's just kinda cruel to tell him ""your dad is about to die and there's nothing you can do about it. We won't let you.""",2023-06-07

Then he steps down, potentially curbing that canon event. I think this is going to be a plot point in Beyond.",2023-06-02

"I think I can forgive that aspect because it functions as a lesson on how loss is inevitable. It shapes us, we grow from it, accept it and carry on with our lives. 

Its strange to see heroes not saving people but Miguel has them convinced. I reckon the sequel will show Miles saving his dad, disproving ""canon events"" and showing the spider-people that loss, while an important part of life, doesn't have to define them and isn't necessary. Gwen has already foreshadowed that a little with her dad surviving.",2023-06-03

"I agree. I had the same thought but just chose to ignore it. If you wanted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt you could say that running away is a lot easier than catching someone, especially if they have spider-man powers.

"That's related to his comic backstory.

If I recall correctly, Miguel was a DNA scientist and Spider-Man already existed in his world.

I felt this while watching as well. There should've been a lighting warning. I am specifically not taking some of my friends due to the lighting.,2023-06-06
The point of the movie is that they're wrong. And my read is that the difference between them and Miles is that they've already lost their loved ones. They're all traumatized and believing that it had to be this way is a useful lie to tell oneself.,2023-06-07

"I just watched it, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I thought it was super disappointing.

My biggest issue is when they completely made up their own definition of what has to happen for a canon event.

They kept bringing up that a police captain has to die, and that's why it's important because Miles' dad is about to be made a captain. While handwaving that the death of Uncle Aaron's death was Miles' moment.

Earth 96283 had nothing to do with a police captain. In the first Spider-verse they show Gwen saving her dad, only to be retconned that he died. Oh, and all police captains have to die.

They just made the rules up. I liked the concept of canon events, they just used it to make up self imposed stakes.",2023-08-26

The twist is that Gwen’s dad is now subverting the canon.,2023-06-02
"I believe there are two separate cannon events

Loss of a family member… Uncle Ben/Aunt May/Uncle Aaron, etc, which gives the Spider-Person motivation to use their “great power”

and loss of a loved one, and I guess that loved one may also be a family member… MJ/Gwen/Peter/Dad. This is the loss that angers the Spider-Person and tests their “true responsibility”",2023-06-02
"Uncle Aaron acted as the equivalent of Miles's Uncle Ben death, which is the first canon event. There is also a second canon event that was specified as ""death of the police captain"".

"Regarding the canon event as I understand it, 1 is the Uncle Ben event, the one that instills the sense of loss and gives the Peters the reason to be Spider.

His uncle was the first canon event (his uncle Ben) while his dad would be a different canon event (his captain Stacy).

The thing with Spider-Man is that saving spider-people from tragedy may prevent them from becoming the person they're supposed to be. And in this case, the heroes that stop Spot. That's why those universes become consumed by him (?). 

Saving the villains from their fate wouldn't change the existence of Spider-Man.

And I want the next film to give its characters consequences regardless of which position it takes.",2023-06-02
"I doubt it. I think the whole idea of the canon event and Miles’ rejection of it has a meta level meaning that Spider-Man doesn’t always need this level of personal tragedies to be good, and mote importantly superhero stories really should stop using them as a motivation tool and come up with something better.",2023-06-02

"I think that Miles's dad was destined to die, just not because of Spot. Remember, neither Miles nor Spot were supposed to happen— they're anomalies. Miles's universe assumedly course corrected already for his presence because 1610-Peter died, so the Spider-Man canon is still mostly in-tact. So going by the logic of the movie, Jeff is still supposed to die but it's less ""they have to die at this specific scenario"" and more of ""they're supposed to die by x means"" type of deal. As long as it fits the canon of ""Police captain dies saving child from falling rubble and Spider-Man fails to save him"" is met, it's fine. 

But Spot isn't accounted for as he's an anomaly and issue that affects not just Miles's universe, but can affect otherwise which makes him a unique and very dangerous threat. Spot's actions just more or less cemented what that canon event had to be rather than it being the original scenario.",2023-06-09

I think it's because nobody really understands how it works. So since his dad dying seems to be an important canon event due to how much it aligns with others then Miguel might think it's Miles' universe trying to correct events to better align with everyone else's.,2023-06-13

"> Miles was never intended to be spiderman so how can his father dying be canon? That doesn't even work in the context of their own argument.

Miles was not meant to be Spider-Man, but he is Spider-Man now so he gets the canon events. 

> Gwen's father quit the force and her universe is still there

Gotta see how the next movie addresses this. It may be that now Gwen is going to have another seperate police captain close to her die, or Miguel is wrong about what canon events are and how they work.",2023-06-15

"There are definitely a couple changes to canon in this and the previous flick, but they try to cover their asses a bit by having Miguel say ""sometimes we can hold things together, sometimes we can't."" As in, it destabilizes everything but sometimes they can stitch it back together. In theory, Chris Pine's Spider-Man dying (and presumably most of the plot of that movie) was not a canon event and according to Miguel should have vaporized that dimension, but ""somehow they fixed it,"" I guess.",2023-06-16

"Well yeah, in the opening he was a good guy and at his core he is a hero. That's why Peter B and Gwen tried to work with him as much as they did regarding stuff with Miles, they trusted and respected him. However, by the time Miles meets Miguel (some ~3 months later), he is undoubtedly an antagonist. He's let the weight of responsibility and concern about maintaining the canon in what he believes is the right way to consume him, using that concern to assure himself that he's doing the right thing. Trying to imprison and assaulting a 15 year old  is not what heroes do though, Miguel's ends do not justify his means.",2023-07-10
"Neither 1610 Miles (protagonist) or 42 Miles (bad) were supposed to become Spider-Men. The Spot— when he was human—managed to bring over Earth-42's spider to Earth-1610, Miles then got bit and became Spider-Man. The result of that is Earth-42's Peter Parker never got bit, and thus never had a Spider-Man. 42 Miles then turned to crime and became the prowler in a distraught NYC, while our Miles became a hero/Spider-Man—the one that wasn't supposed to exist.",2023-07-14
"You raise a lot of great questions about the canon and how Miguel's explanation doesn't match up with a lot that's happened, that's exactly the point. BTSV will definitely give us more insight into how these things actually work and show why Miguel is wrong.

Earth-42 Miles doesn't have the influence of his policeman father anymore, but he does have his Uncle Aaron. We know that our Miles really looked up to his Aaron, so it's likely that Earth-42 Miles did the same. Without Jeff to balance out the more criminal influence of Aaron, it makes sense for Miles to take after his uncle more and more.

The spider was brought to another universe by happenstance, Spot and Dr. Octavius were running small tests on interdimensional technology and one of these tests happened to pull through the spider from Earth-42 (since that Earth is so similar to 1610). That's why Spot claims responsibility for making Miles Spider-Man, because his testing is what brought the spider that bit him to Earth-1610.",2023-07-13

with M&G:

\-Their lives aren't great. They don't have a lot of friends and their relationships with their parents are deteriorating. The only person that understands them is the other. They quiet literally NEED each other.

\- They're so likeable. They haven't showed a glimpse of evil or selfishness throughout the movies.

\-Their reasons to not be together are very understandable. Being together has a chance of ruining the spider verse (as there can't be multiple spideys in one universe). Gwen dies whenever she falls for Spider-Man. So that's one thing to look out for. It literally makes sense

Also the fight scenes seemed to have 0 stakes because every fight scene was just characters fighting a bad guy nothing happening and everybody is laughing during the fight. I’m genuinely curious if I watched the wrong movie or if everyone who watched it hasn’t watched a movie before this one.

"- Might be there are some forms of multidimensional travel that are stable and some that are not? In the Spider-verse movies it's caused by Fisk ripping a hole in the dimensional fabric pretty violently with a supercollider and the rifts aren't...pretty. But clearly there are ways to stabilize that - the watches for one - so maybe Strange's spell worked differently even if it wasn't supposed to go the way it did.

- I don't think it matters HOW it happens as long as it DOES happen, and maybe if it wasn't Spot it would've been someone else. I think the implication was there would've been some other event that would've caused Pavritr to have to pick between the bus or Captain Singh and the end result is the same no matter how he gets there.

That's just heroic.

If Miles tried to break the multiverse to get his father back, that'd be different. But what Miguel is trying to do is to *force* things to happen a certain way, then claim that it was all obviously predestined.

They probably avoided having too many different Spideys interacting with Miles to avoid being too fanservicey and distracting from the plot. The movie already runs pretty long with Miles only interacting with the main cast.

True.

Gwen and Peter really wanted to visit Miles and if they thought it possible they would've, but they knew just how serious Miguel was about not risking things with Miles' anomalous status. If either Gwen or Peter did step out of line to visit Miles, that would pose the risk of losing their watch and being completely trapped in their own dimension forever. They were trying to be patient in hopes of helping Miguel get all the villain anomalies sorted so that they could convince him to let them see Miles. We see that this did actually work for Gwen and she was able to see him after being patient, unfortunately Spot happened and messed things up from there.",2023-06-28

">the other complaint i have is that they shouldn't have any references to live action movies

Yess I've been waiting to see if anyone else felt this way. The MCU has so severely disappointed me in recent years that I don't want to be reminded of any of it. I also feel like bringing in the live action stuff complicates things in a way I can't quite describe. It's just better for them to standalone. Even just seeing live action people playing within an animated movie is jarring and takes me out of the world (which is why I didn't like the donald glover cameo).

When I saw the ""in association with marvel"" thing at the start, my heart skipped a beat. I don't want them to get their grimy, money-obsessed hands on these movies. I don't want them to ruin this the way they ruined their own universe.",2023-06-29
"How do you know no one died in the Tobey universe that was a police captain when we see him again in the Spider-Man no way home film it’s been years and a lot has happened to him…

Like if they wanna cameo some MCU stuff that’s fine, or vice versa… but no straight up story strongly involving any live action stuff.",2023-06-05
">it seems it sounds like Miles would only doom his own universe

just got out of a screening and Miguel says that canon-breaking events can create things (the black hole thing) that destroy the entire 'spider-verse' if they aren't contained, it's visualised when the Mumbhatten world shatters and it spread through the entire web and it falls like red rain around Miles during Miguel's explanation. They could have probably done a better job explaining this for sure though. 

When Miguel calls Miles an anomaly, he doesn't mean literally - he means his existence is essentially an anomaly because he was bit by a spider from another dimension. This pisses Miguel off because Miles is ""breaking the rules"" simply by existing. The thing he would do to doom his own universe is save his dad, which (if we take Miguel at face value) would create another black hole thing that could spread to every universe. And he knows Miles will simply keep doing this until the Spider-Verse is destroyed, or that's what he believes anyway. That's why Miguel didn't want Miles to know about the Spider-Verse canon situation, because he knows Miles will break canon by saving his Dad. Whether this is a good/right thing to believe is another story.",2023-06-05

"No real spoilers. but super-vague mention of order of events (stuff like, ""the climax would probably feel...""):

I wouldn't recommend it at all, this movie assumes you've seen the first one. I guess you would get by and understand what's going on in terms of story--even if it doesn't always fill in back-stories, the implications of what happened in the past movie would be an easy jump (I think? It's hard to pretend I haven't seen the first one).

But I also think it would be 100x more enjoyable if you see the first before this--lots of callbacks, backstory, and characterizations from that carry over into this one. The climax, for example, relies on knowing what happened to Miles in the first one, and is then explained further after it happens instead of before. So you would understand what happens with this alone *eventually*, but it would be jumbled. The last act also really relies on the first one, otherwise a particular event would feel *incredibly* random. The first one also did a phenomenal job building relationships, so a lot of the scenes would probably fall flat if you aren't previously invested.

TLDR: Highly recommend you spend an hour or so streaming the first, then go see this. Plus the first is also excellent, so it won't even be a chore. \^\_\^

I knew Infinity War was part 1 of 2. I thought it was just fine, but at that point I fell out of MCU stuff. 

I think the ending feels worse here because it's a follow-up to a great insular tightly paced movie that stands alone, and it wasn't marketed as ""Part 1"" (apparently it was in 2021, but they dropped that from the title) so I went in expecting another tightly wound complete story and got a really abrupt ending.

Given that this Miles is the Prowler, I take it he's probably seen more than his share of supervillains. Given that they hinted at the 42 Sinister six, I'm sure it's not out of their realm of possibility.

Also, Alt Miles has a dead father and was raised into the Prowler by his Uncle. I'd reckon that'd make anyone into a hateful little fucker, I don't think it'd be difficult to understand why he'd hate a version of himself that has what he doesn't.",2023-06-03

well in the first movie the spider comes from the Collider room and it was glitching alot. so they aren't convincing they literally showed you in the first movie it was from a different universe. It was a show rather than tell thing from the first movie.

> as well as how the original team members couldn't visit Miles?

Miguel and his team wouldnt let them. Probably to stop them from telling him about his canon event, Miguel probably also has some plan for the first anomaly so it makes sense he doesn't let his friends go see him and tell him about the spider team thing.

The most unpopular opinion. Get ready to be flamed by redditors man.,2023-06-03
"The film focuses so strongly on the idea of family and responsibility of being a spiderman. The baggage they have to carry as a spiderman and with miles, staying true to oneself and also tackling what is the idea of spiderman as a character.

The movie was also trying to break away from the idea of how spiderman has to be and what spiderman should be which has trapped the character of spiderman to always be tied to the death of his loved one (uncle Ben etc) and how the character always has to suffer and remain the status quo of spiderman is the poor friendly neighbourhood spiderman that struggles to balance his life and cant get everything he wants.

The other spidermen accepted how some things are supposed to happen and spiderman can't save everyone while the movie seems to be highlighting almost superbly with Miles that the idea of  spiderman is that he always tries to save everyone even if he can't save everyone.

 Just because you can't save everyone doesn't mean you shouldn't try and we will see a lot of that payoff in the third movie. Miles kinda represents what spiderman actually is while all the other spidermen are lost to their fate.

There was a lot going on in this movie and the visuals are there to tell the unique characteristics of each of the spiderman. It was one of the most well written movie that really show great representation of the familial struggle of being a parent to a teen and a teen that is growing up way too fast and finding his ownself with gwen and Miles.

To say it was just tik tok vomit, pointless jokes and boring conversations is really baffling to me. This was far from braindead but idk the movie is not for you, I guess.

A little add on, when people like you make baseless assumptions and tries to insult ""the type of people that watch this movie"" says more about you than others honestly. You can critique and hate a movie but you don't have to be an ass about it.",2023-06-03

Stuff like ""bitten by a radioactive spider,"" ""Uncle Ben/Uncle Aaron/Aunt May dies,"" ""A good friend becomes the Hobgoblin,"" etc. The movie is concerned with ""A police captain close to them dies"" because that's the specific event Miles stopped from happening in Mumbhattan, and because Miles' dad is about to become captain, but it's not the only such event.",2023-06-02

1. they stop Miles's dad become captain, so they can save him without affecting the canon???
2. the original Spidey in Miles universe already sacrifice his 'captain' (probably Stacy's), so saving Capt. Miles won't affect the canon.
3. It's all just coincidence, no such thing as canon, he isn't Kang / TVA, Miguel can't see the future / can't predict the real outcome. It's just a problem of Causation / Correlation thing. (They can't really predict when the will spot comeback, its just the algorithm)

It is also probably canon in Spider-Man lore that no matter how much good he does to the city, there will be some people who hate him, who see him as a lawless vigilante, and that is also one point this movie showed, with the conflict of Captain Stacy and Miles not being able to tell his dad",2023-06-03

"1) Venom strike (his electric shock power); it just looked different from normal due to Miguel's suit being so electronic.

2) It almost certainly wasn't their plan all along. It's unclear if they even knew (or cared) that Miles' next canon event was coming up before he got their attention in Mumbattan.  If they did, the reason it's a canon event is that it's not something Spider-Man is normally able to stop; however, once he acquired meta knowledge that the event is coming, he may have been able to prevent it by doing something that normally wouldn't happen without foreknowledge, like taking his dad and locking him in a safe place for the duration of Spot's attack.",2023-06-12
I just treat them as entirely separate multiverses. They're no doubt going to retcon spider verse into the MCU but it just raises continuity issues like this.,2023-06-12
Strange is still magically traveling the universes which is a more natural way than the sciencey method the Spider-Men are using. But I really doubt the main MCU and the Spiderverse movies are collaborating and establishing rules for each other.,2023-06-12
"It's unlikely, because Miguel is shown at the end of the first movie to be just trying out the multiverse hopping watch prototype for the first time, *after* Lyla shows him Miles beating Kingpin and all the other spiders going back to their home dimension. Which means he couldn't travel to other dimensions *after* Miles had defeated Kingpin.

Also, we're not given any indication that Miguel can travel to the past with his watch. Every time each spider hops to a different universe, time is flowing parallely in each dimension.

So, Miguel couldn't have been present at the time and place to kill Aaron Prowler.",2023-06-15
I bet that's one of the things we'll find out in the next movie.,2023-06-15
"I think that's why they call Miles-1610 an ***anomaly*** - because the spider biting him instead of Miles-42 didn't erase either universe, but just changed the trajectory of their futures - Peter-1610, who originally would have stopped the collider from running (according to Miguel), now had to save Miles-1610 in the middle of his fight, which gives the collider time to start, and by that time the space time continuum had already been torn open, and Peter eventually dies. (And of course Miles-42 becomes the Prowler instead of his original fate to become his dimension's Spider-Man)

I think this, the fact that the trajectory of the future can be altered without drastic consequences will prove to be the key that Miguel is missing in his Spider-verse canon hypothesis (another example is George Stacy in Earth-65 retiring from being a police captain, thus no longer being in canonical danger).

Edit: I recalled that the stray villains captured and kept in the Spider-HQ are also called ""anomalies"", so the name anomaly won't relate to my theory. But anyway, the fact that there must be a way to circumvent canon events safely will be the key to save Miles' dad without destroying the multiverse.",2023-06-15
"""I lured everyone away from your spider base didn't I?""",2023-06-18
Miles saving the kid interrupted the canon event. While Gwen’s dad quitting caused the canon event to never happen in the first place. I think there’s a difference and the significance of the ending was Gwen coming to the conclusion that there is a way to change the outcome of canon events without destroying the spiderverse.,2023-07-01
">I wonder how Gwen’s dad not going for captain anymore is going to affect the canon events and what their going to do with Gwen/Mile’s dad.

It's a huge reach, but her father quitting as captain could be interpreted as ""a captain close to spiderman dies saving a child"". In other words, Gwen's father killed the captain side of him for his child.",2023-07-09

It’s not just the tragedies that connect these individuals but also the way that they respond to those tragedies and do their best to make things right.

Yea other guy said it best Spider-Man 2099 is decades after Miles. Assuming Miles took over the role from Peter in 2020 ish. He technically wasn’t alive when Miles caused the first anomaly. The fact that he’s from a different universe too sony can throw him anywhere in the timeline.,2023-06-03

Spiders actually do have claws and paws too. Some also have a paralyzing bite too. So that’s why Miguel is the way he is. This is consistent with the comics too. His whole thing is that he’s the unconventional and non traditional spider-man.
He is also incredibly more hardened to the world than any other spider-man. If it comes down to killing a villain he’ll do it, but he’s more of an asshole with a good heart. Like all spider-men he’s fucked up but he’s REALLY fucked up cus of his trauma.

EVERYTIME. no questioned asked. he doesn’t make sacrifices, he does everything in his power to defy the odds. and of course, he can’t always succeed and can’t always save everyone, but he will always try. miguel has gotten so obsessed with his grief and the mistakes that he’s made, that’s he’s accepted this idea of sacrificing innocent lives for “the greater good,” when really he’s just trying to reconcile for the destruction he caused of his alternate universe. he’s not being the good guy anymore, gwen’s right.",2023-06-04

It was great to see them all back! Was Peni's mech different from the first movie? I thought it looked more Evangelion-esque like the comics but I could just be misremembering.,2023-06-02
"I'm hoping the next one will give me the same feeling we all did the first time watching Endgame. Cause after watching the film, I got the exact same feeling I had the first time I watched Infinity War",2023-06-02
"They had a few more Spidey there besides then iirc, no?",2023-06-02
"I think that's now my favorite appearance of known hero in a movie, I got so hyped seeing everyone.",2023-06-02
I was so unbelievably happy at that shot.,2023-06-05
Already was at the end of the first one. You see him complete the Rubix cube in a single shot as Miles is wrapping the movie up in his closing monologue/montage.,2023-06-02
"Yeah. When the first teaser was released back in... 2021 I think? It said Across The Spider-verse Part One. But I guess since then they decided to have different names instead. I totally get why you would be confused though.

I couldn't understand like 50% of what he says. Didn't like him cause of it but fuck he's my fav by the end of the movie.,2023-06-02
He doesn't believe in audio balancing.,2023-06-02

"I was at an IMAX and the beginning monolog by Gwen was drowned out by the drums. I've never been to an IMAX so I thought it was just that. 

And the sound effects during the India sequence made it hard to understand both Pavitr Prabhakar and Punk with their accents. The dude beside me who kept laughing anytime a character with an Indian accent talked didn't help either.",2023-06-02

A lot of the voice levels seemed low to me,2023-06-03
I had issues in my theater with voice levels for most of the scenes. Especially when Gwen is narrating in the beginning. My theater had no problems with any other sound being clear.,2023-06-03
"Yeah almost all of his dialogue I completely missed. There were a few other times, mostly during fight scenes where they blared the music or when Miles and Spot talked over each other

It wasn't too bad in the theater, but it definitely felt a bit muted. Especially in his first scene, you could barely hear him out over the explosions.",2023-06-03

"I found a lot of the voice levels were low, the music and effects were too loud.",2023-06-04
I did. The only (very mild) complaint I have about this movie was that it sounded like they hired Chris Nolan’s sound mixer at times.,2023-06-05
"Could’ve been your theater or your ears, only once or twice I didn’t understand what Spider-Punk said but because of the accent. But I heard everything else including when Gwen was talking during drumming",2023-06-04
"Felt that way during the opening monologue and the closing monologue by Gwen for the entire movie... which made for the ending to not hit as well as it probably should have. It was just really quiet, and I'm not sure if maybe it was my seat in the corner of the theater that was the problem.  

I look forward to watching this when I can have subtitles on so I don't miss anything.",2023-06-05
"This is partly why I always take the showing with English subs, even though my hearing is just fine. 

The other part is that sometimes my attention slips.",2023-06-05

I've been watching nothing but BBC stuff this past month and could only understand 50% of his lines. The mixing was pretty bad,2023-06-02

"I was just going to say that. Yes, his audio levels were too low. Also Daniel spoke really fast and not particularly clear. Maybe they asked him to re-record his lines and he said ""I don't take orders mate.""",2023-06-05
There were times where I felt the audio was hard to hear especially their dialogue in the beginning.,2023-06-05
"I'm really good with accents, especially British ones but he was pretty hard to understand",2023-06-05
"yeah, I was definitely like ""Fuck, I'm going to have to wait to stream this to hear wtf he is saying""",2023-06-06
Yes! I was really missing my supportive captions,2023-06-06
"My theater had shit sound mixing (or I was sitting too close to the speaker that was only playing music), so I had to strain to hear anyone's dialogue throughout the whole movie.",2023-06-06
Yes the accent,2023-06-12
"Same, both accent and speaking volume made it really difficult. I can't wait to rewatch on streaming so I can have subtitiles on and also have the ability to pause and rewind to catch all the visual references and gags.",2023-06-13

"Also, the bootleg bracelet thing he made... That was made out of the things he was swiping from Spider-Squad HQ or whatever it was called, right?

i was so mad when i started loving him,2023-06-02
This is beautiful 🥹,2023-06-04
That spinning shot was fucking incredible. The whole sequence was just gorgeous.,2023-06-03
"the nicest detail was she webed up anchor points to seat, so she would have contact point with the hands....but in the end they were both feet and hand free, so they were with their butts glued lol",2023-06-03
And a call forward apparently to the Spider-verse HQ being upside down for some reason.,2023-06-02
Using her webs to to pull herself “down” was a great touch.,2023-06-06
"I adore that they didn't dance around their feelings or ""will they wont they"" things. Even with two whole movies, they go balls-out ""yeah uhh fuckin in every universe Gwen falls in love with Spider-man"" in their first scenes together lmao",2023-06-02
https://i.imgur.com/fqA4zeF.jpg,2023-06-03
To be fair every frame of the movie is wallpaper material.,2023-06-05
Ha same. I felt very uneasy during the whole upside down scene even though I knew both characters would be fine.,2023-06-02
Same! It was too visually rich and clearly upside-down for my body to accept.,2023-06-04
Same! I felt so...off the whole time.,2023-06-12
"They’re either used to it or their bodies were modified to handle it, there’s also that scene where they swing upside down with the web attached to their foot, so sitting upside down is probably nothing compared to that.",2023-06-04
I don’t remember where but I think at some point a comic explained that it just… doesn’t happen to Spider-Man. They can be upside down all they want.,2023-06-07
Do you know if Sony/Marvel release high def images of it?,2023-07-04
"My lord that's such a great detail. Yes his ""Morales"" pronunciation was definitely stronger",2023-06-03
"It's a different voice actor too.

I noticed that as well. Your explanation makes a lot of sense",2023-06-03
He definitely had a stronger accent. I hadn't thought about it but your reasoning makes a lot of sense. Amazing how detailed it gets,2023-06-03
"It's only a few lines but yeah, that was also the impression I got.",2023-06-03
Especially with the braids. That’s the like go to Dominican/puerto rican look for teenagers lmao. I like prowler miles. He seems like a cool as villain/anti hero,2023-06-06
"That’s a plausible explanation but the actual reason for the voice change is due to another Easter egg in the movie. When Miles-1610’s mom says she thinks Spider-Man is Puerto Rican and he responds jokingly and nervously that he “seems more Dominican”, the voice actor for Miles-42, Jharrel Jerome is a nod to that. Jharrel is actually Afro-Latino of Dominican descent. Jharrel Jerome has also frequently been suggested by fans to play the live-action version of Miles for a long time now and he has expressed interest in playing the character as well. His inclusion was a clever way of giving him the chance to finally play him and also keeping Shameik Moore as the voice of Miles-1610.",2023-06-05
Definitely had a stronger Spanish accent like Rio. Totally didn’t notice he had a different voice actor until someone pointed it out though.,2023-06-04
"Yup, he definitely rolled the R in Morales.  The same thing dawned on me about his dad not being there and it kind of floored me.  One rolled R developing actual backstory is just insane.",2023-06-08
Rio-42 was speaking more Spanish with him than 1610 was too,2023-06-05
I noticed it was stronger but didn't connect why....the attention to detail is astounding. Take note of these movies every other movie producer.,2023-06-05
I’m pretty sure he was played by another actor too.,2023-06-04
"I noticed that too and I respect the world so much for that. You know the writers and producers were having a lot of conversations about what earth #42 would look like and what miles would look like if his story had gone different. They didn't just change his hair, it's how he talks and walks and holds himself.",2023-06-10
"he wasn't spider-man, so maybe he didn't skip as many spanish classes?",2023-06-17
Also different texture hair. I felt like he looked more like his mom as well in the profile shot of the two of them but I don’t know if I was trippin.,2023-06-16
"But his dad still died after being promoted to captain so he probably was still around for most of his life.

The accent could have been him just embracing his mom more.",2023-06-07
its giving Marty McFly returning to an alt-1985 and realizes everything is ruled by Biff Tannen vibes,2023-08-08
Yes 100%. Noticed that,2023-06-11
"Yup. When he introduces himself as ""I'm Miles Morales"", at least in the German version, he rolls the R just like the college lady at the start does to try and emphasize his Spanish speaking side.",2023-06-27
Didn't his dad die recently tho,2023-11-07
Of a black teen?,2023-06-04
Man you Did not just go there! 🤣🤣💀,2023-06-05

They also felt to me like James Bond credits,2023-06-03
"Their artists are severely underpaid with no overtime bonus like in California, also they cut them loose the moment their contract is over and only few gets to stay. It's an extremely high turn over work place with a lot of moving around. Pixar mostly have their folks with secure full time jobs. So if people wonder why Spiderverse has such low budget, learn that their artists are underpaid. 

Sony is looking to expand to Montreal and I saw a posting starting rate at USD22/hr.",2023-06-18
This actually has the largest crew in history apparently fot an animated movie.,2023-06-16

Shit was hilarious.",2023-06-06
My kids were the same. My daughter was stoked about the movie and my son was pissed lol. He complained about it being a rip off the whole way home even though he’s bout the one that paid for it. He’s truly my son,2023-06-03

And now we gotta wait a year to see what happens, haven’t wanted to see a sequel so bad since Infinity War",2023-06-02

"This was the first time in a very long time I audibly reacted to the end of a movie.  Partly because for once I wasn't in the know about this being a two-parter going in and partly because of where the movie left off in general. The movie is superbly paced so it's not like I felt the time or anything but the being in the wrong universe/alt Miles swerve had me wondering how they were going to wrap this all up with the remaining time.

So Gwen getting the band back together so-to-speak and revealing Miles Spoiler left my jaw dropped when we got TO BE CONTINUED.  Me and the theater crowd all were like wait wut? No wayyyy!",2023-06-02

when the to be continued came it all made sense",2023-06-04
"I felt the two hours, this movie was great but it doesn’t match the pacing of the first one",2023-06-04
I had to pee in the final minutes of the movie. My verdict. I would rather pee my pants in order to get 2 more hours of the movie than wait 10 months LMAO!,2023-06-04
"I could’ve if I wasn’t approaching my second bathroom break. Thats the only reason I was aware of how long the movie was going. I really gotta stop drinking soda at movies I wanna see all the way through, but popcorn and soda are a part of the movies for me.",2023-06-04
I extremely loved the movie but could definitely feel the two hour runtime; on the backend I thought it was about to end at least three times before it actually did,2023-06-05
Hahaha this was me tonight. I knew it had been awhile but i was enjoying the movie so much and avoided all the conversation and it slowly clicked the movie was over right before the “to be continued”,2023-06-10
It seemed like it was approaching the climax but when the plot was stalling I had a feeling we weren’t getting an ending today.,2023-06-11
"Yeah. My son immediately said ""ah, of course!"" There was no time left for a true resolution to everything that is set up.",2023-06-11
Completely agree. The pacing of this and the first movie are top-notch,2023-06-12
"Yes, this is what i felt. I was thinking ""oh boy, its gonna be an amazing third act"" and the bam. It ended. 
I guess its nice that they made it so entertaining that i didnt even realize its been 2hs but at the moment it felt like a slap on the face",2023-06-12
the whole thing is paced well but once they get to the spider society or whatever time absolutely flew.,2023-11-12
"I am so incredibly late to this discussion, but I legitimately thought that Miles went to the Prowler-Miles verse about half way through the film.",2024-01-27
"Yeah, my theater seemed like more excitement than annoyance. Movie itself is a lot to digest, so fun to end like that.",2023-06-03
"Not me, because I like checking my watch from time to time, hehehe.",2023-06-03
"My theater literally turned into the movie theater from Scream 2. Drinks went flying, popcorn buckets sailed, popcorn everywhere, dogs and cats living together, people just jumping/running around yelling and shouting with various emotions. My friend and I just sat there watching it happen like, ""What the actual hell are we  witnessing?"" This was a 3:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday showing with families and kids and such. The place turned into a mad-house. And then after about two minutes of this everyone aggressively just exited the theater, not like pushing and shoving but like they were together in their passion/anger/emotions/etc. Once the coast was clear and my friend and I were both comfortable enough to express out-loud, ""What the fuck was that?"" did we actually get up and leave.",2023-06-04
If I looked it up and saw this movie was 5 hours I'd have packed diapers and got 2 drinks and 2 popcorns.,2023-06-06
"a girl in our theater said ""what the fuck!?"" and the whole theater started laughing",2023-06-03
I said to my mates i didn't want it to end.,2023-06-02
"My theater got an immediate “Bruh” from the back-row, didn’t miss a beat",2023-06-03
"I honestly thought it was a joke, like after the title splash it would say ""Right now""",2023-06-05
"At the second screening I went to there were two audible reactions: ""Dude!"" and ""What the FUCK?!""

They truly spoke for all of us.",2023-06-05
That was me. I was that guy.,2023-06-04
"Yeah ngl, 

I knew it was going to be 2 parts since that was first announced but I really forgot until it started to feel long and I thought “there’s no way the can end this soon” then I remembered",2023-06-02
I only learned of this like half a month ago while looking up the exact date and noticing there was another movie with similar name dated for 2024. I don't recall it being mentioned in any official trailer.,2023-06-02
I consider it more to be a middle chapter. Empire Strikes Back ends in a similar way with plenty unresolved: one of the main characters is stuck in a dire predicament while everyone else is preparing to save him and stop the bad guys.,2023-06-02
I can forgive the questionable advertising. Audiences tend to be warier of movies with Part 1 in their names,2023-06-02
It's a movie about playing with tropes. Dusting off an honest-to-god shocking cliffhanger was a great metatextual move.,2023-06-03
"I think a lot of people felt that way with Dune as well. It just kinda ended and I bet most didn't know it was being split into two. Also IT, to a similar degree. I didn't get the Chapter One until the end credits, but it had a pretty good ending to wrap it up.",2023-06-05
It was plenty advertised as part 1 lol,2023-06-03
It was advertised Part One in the first teaser. That how I knew at least.,2023-06-05
"It felt like it was building up to a climax… and then it just ended. Like, the whole movie felt like buildup to absolutely nothing.",2023-06-16
"I saw it yesterday and people actually were waiting until the lights turned on, because I think most of us thought it was a fake out.

I was left disappointed.",2023-06-05
"Exact same thing here. My kids were pissed, lol.",2023-06-09
"I'm not gonna lie it was a very awkward stop. Great character writing, great visuals, great script, but that awkward cut is gonna hurt it critically in retrospect",2023-06-05
That’s my audience right there.,2023-06-05
Yeah same here. I felt that Miles.,2023-06-05
The way I gasped...,2023-06-05
"This is why I don't like people coming into my room. Even if they mean well, they don't know how I like things.",2023-06-15
"This really did not need to be a two parter, and splitting it feels like a cheap cash grab. There was so much fluff that could’ve just been cut.

Gwen’s opener and Miles’s fight with spot could’ve been tightened.

The scene where they drop an add for the spider man game and a plug for Nike could’ve been cut.

Lego Spider-Man and half of the other random Spider-Men thrown in for gags could’ve been cut.

The huge Spider-Man chase could’ve been cut in half.

The entire plot point of Miles going to the wrong universe could’ve probably been cut, but we’ll have to see how much it ends up playing into the movie’s theme. Right now, it feels like a wasteful side plot that isn’t going to pay off, though. 

The movie had some good humor and the emotional beats worked, but it honestly feels like the studio told them to bloat it so they could cut it in two to make more money.",2023-06-07
"IMO, they shouldn’t have revealed Miles in Earth-42 until the next movie. Have him go into the Go Home Machine, leave, and then bookend the movie with a focus on Gwen (as in the cold open) assembling a team to rescue him. Include a scene of her confronting Miguel and quitting the Spider Force. Make sure he says something to the effect of “You’re also an anomaly” and vowing to capture both her and Miles. Save the stuff with The Spot and Earth-42 for the sequel. That way it feels like at least one plot thread was somewhat resolved, but also that this ending is merely a jumping off point for the next one to pick up from immediately.",2023-06-02
"This. It got my blood pumping and then it was ""to be continued"". I didn't realize it was just a part 1. I thought the movie coming out next year was just the third movie. Not that I was being shown half of a plot and the other half to be shown later. Definitely could have been handled much better than that awkward ""okay the movie is over now"" cut off",2023-06-05
"Yea I can't actually say I enjoyed the film yet. I've been left with all the negative emotions associated with the stress of act 2 and the heartbreaking reveals of ""you knew"" and then dumped out of the theater with no aftercare.",2023-06-09
"Ya I agree completely. It would need a bit of a rewrite, but they could have ended this one way better.

Maybe if they developed spot a little less, and made 2099 seem a little more sinister to Miles, and Miles a little more wary of him so it really felt like escaping him was the big ending of the movie. Then also at the same time put a little more focus on Gwen's internal struggles, and have it kind of resolve with the escape and Gwen making good with her dad. The whole ""Miles Dad dying is canon"" could have been kept secret and not the primary reason for Miles needing to escape - instead he was just getting away from what appeared to be nefarious motives by 2099. So then you give a fake ending to the movie after Gwen's situation resolves, splash the title on the screen one more time, then go to the scene with Miles realizing he's in the wrong universe because his uncle is alive again. He glitches out, and bam, that's your ending. Way better, a little more sense of conclusion before it's ripped away from you - but a lot more mystery about what's the come.",2023-06-02
"Just got out and it kinda felt like the last 20 minutes or so were cut, not a whole movie worth of time.",2023-06-07
"Yeah for me the ""to be continued"" completely ruined the movie. Went from an 8/10 with final twist, which I loved, to  a 2/10. This movie built up to a climax then just ended.

This is entirely different from, say, Infinity War, which had a complete story of its own, with a climax, and it was like the end of a chapter, with more to tell.

This was just not a complete story.",2023-06-20
The screening I went to had one guy audibly shout the biggest “fuck you!” at the theater screen ever. That man was not pleased with an unfinished story.,2023-06-02
I feel like saying “we get more of this” is a pretty weak reason to end the movie at such a bad spot lol,2023-06-03
"But then they would miss seeing this movie in the big screen.  

An experience all it’s own.",2023-06-02
"Wasn't a fan of the cliffhanger ending, but the audio-visual experience alone is worth the price of admission",2023-06-03
Empire Strikes Back was technically a cliffhanger as well as Infinity War,2023-06-04
Always leave them wanting more!,2023-06-03
"I'm kinda late to the party, but even as a two parter, this isnt really a satisfying ending. Infinity War/End Game, was also a two parter, but IW still had a definite ending while at the same time building up to EG. The Spiderverse ending would be more like if IW ended just as Thanos got the last stone. The ""snap"" was incredibly important for the movie.",2023-06-12
[deleted],2023-06-02
I knew it was a part 1. I was so immersed in the movie that I just genuinely forgot and I was so upset I went OH NO out loud.,2023-06-02
"Yea all those “casual fans” who show up to a movie on opening night on a work night.

Nobody in a theatre on opening night Thursday can be referred to as “casual audience” imo",2023-06-02
That’s what I figured,2023-06-02
lol... a casual fan is one who doesn't want spoilers? Ya ok 👍,2023-06-02
Yeah kids are such casuals lmao,2023-06-02
Who tf is dm’ing you. People need to grow up,2023-06-02
I watched no trailers or promos coming into this and didn’t even know there was a third one being made. The “To be continued” came as a big surprise to me,2023-06-18
"I liked the movie... But for me it dragged a bit, because it felt like acts 1 and 2 of a movie. And the first act felt really long.

It made sense when it ended. But I hated that about it.

The visuals, action, dialog, and everything, was great, so it is still enjoyable, but...",2023-06-05

It's difficult to even explain what they've done here and the deeper you are into animation and visual development, the more insane this final product is.",2023-11-02
"I feel like these movies really highlight the creative skimp Pixar is in. I saw a trailer for Elementals beforehand, and it just looked so visually uninspired. It hasn't evolved past Monster's Inc. from like 20 years ago.

I want to see more visually creative stuff. Stylisation is so common in games yet weirdly lacking in movies.",2023-06-07
[deleted],2023-06-05
I’d also throw Promare (2019) in there for visual competition. If I didn’t know any better I would go as far as to say Promare might’ve inspired some of those action shots in the climax with the way the fight scenes are presented.,2023-06-02

"I agree, Arcane deviates in style a couple times, like in Jinx’s showdown with Ekko, but here they have a unique art style for each universe. Plus those creative decisions are relevant to the plot, contribute to the storytelling, allude to the comics, etc. It’s so impressive.",2023-06-07
worth pointing out its also kid cudi's combined film/album concept (and the first i've seen) so the synergy of the soundtrack is on par with metro's score in spiderverse scenes,2023-06-29

Just wish they brought you on board to help!

Hopefully you just got out of seeing the movie with some pretty cool friends ;)",2023-06-02
I'm so confused. Were you involved with the film? Did they have to pay to use your models or let you know or credit you?,2023-06-02
">my LEGO Spider-Man minifig design was used

Did someone from the production reach out to you about doing this, or did they just use your design without telling you?",2023-06-12
That’s awesome!,2023-06-04
That video was so cool! And I love the 90s theme song at the end!,2023-11-04

Spot’s art style as he gains power is serious eldritch horror,2023-06-02
I actually thought he was gonna be a villain of the week to introduce us to a more experienced Miles and that the movie would transition to Miguel being the full on bad guy. Nice to see they’re keeping Miguel as a good guy just from a different perspective,2023-06-02
"I love how his usual awkward, akimbo stance didn't change over the course of the movie, but it went from making him look goofy to making him unsettling.",2023-06-03

"Seeing this movie and then seeing trailers for dreamworks projects like that Kraken movie or Pixar’s Elemental honestly makes them seem worse. I know those are primed way more towards kids than this or even Puss in Boots 2, but I genuinely don’t find much reason to watch those in theaters when animated movies like this exist.",2023-06-05
The animators should really be proud of themselves. Before this animation was either anime or Pixar style and there was nothing much in between when it came to big movies. They really did such a crazy cool thing with this movie.,2023-06-25
Right? I actually prefer it when movies are animated. The whole comic book style just wouldn't work as live action,2023-06-13
I absolutely LOVED the Spot in the older Spider-Man animated series. I had a DVD of the portal saga and used to watch it on repeat as a kid.,2023-07-14
i feel like that was a minor concept of the film too. miles was super late to several important life events bc he felt he had to solve all these petty crimes,2023-06-02
"Eh, I think things would have still gotten worse. Spot still had a vendetta against Miles, but things just escalated a lot more quickly due to his involvement. 

Spot still seems like a multiversal threat before Miles involvement, I'm also not sure how anyone could contain him even prior to Miles getting involved.",2023-06-02
In this universe…… Beyoncé is Spider-Diva.,2023-06-04
Yeah I think it's absolutely masterful the way the story manages to contain the high concept with Miles' personal character journey. The emotional high points of this movie hit really hard. I think the only thing it suffers from is being incomplete as part 1 of 2. But that being said I'm soooo fucking glad they got the chance to really spread this story out instead of stuffing it all into one movie.,2023-06-02
"Sequels are always hard to overcome, especially for this movie in particular since it was so acclaimed for its novelty in terms of animation. I enjoyed the first film more too nevertheless this was a strong sequel that succeeded in taking its strong suits up a notch I.e. the sound design and the art style.

The few sequels I can think of that overtook its predecessor without the first movie sucking would probably be Nolan’s Batman and Mad Max.",2023-06-04

I have a feeling Spot is the Peter Parker that would have been bitten if Miles hadn't.,2023-06-02
Like that scene from John Wick Chapter 4 with the room of giant paintings lol,2023-06-05
"This movie does stand on its own though I think. I'd argue the stand alone story of Across the Spider-Verse is actually about Gwen. There is a full story arc with her over the course of the movie, while the movie also serves as a proper 2nd act to the trilogy itself",2023-06-08
No but the voice actor did a damn good job sounding like him,2023-06-03
"Absolutely, they really stole the show for me. Her entire opening sequence was such a strong start to the movie, the art style was absolutely beautiful.

The only other scene that came close was when Gwen and Miles were sitting upside down overlooking New York, but the use of colour and shadows towards the end with the Prowler looked amazing as well.",2023-06-02
This movie is ***art***.,2023-06-02
Basically a Gwen mini movie within the movie!,2023-06-03

"My favorite part was when he first learns Gwen’s secret, and he’s struggling with his mission to get “justice” for Peter is opposing his love for Gwen.

So random seeing you in this thread as a huge fan of your art...very cool!,2023-06-10

Right?! Distinct is perfect description. All the characters feel so unique but still whole. I'm blown away by the craft of this thing,2023-06-08
I called it watercolor and my partner told me the same thing haha,2023-06-05
They do such an amazing job translating the art style from different comics to the screen. It’s insane how well all of them blend together to make one cohesive world,2023-06-02

Chekhov's happiness right there.,2023-06-02
I would think they did it just to spite marvel comics itself because of how much they want to shit on Peter in general.,2023-06-03
"I feel like the baby is in danger. Peter said that he had the kid because of Miles. Miles is an anomaly that was never intended to become Spiderman. Thus, by that logic, Mayday's very existance is an anomaly as well.

 Miguel is giving me *strong* ""pretends to do bad for good but is secretly evil and misguiding the heroes for ulterior motives"" vibes so maybe to up the scale of villainy to fill another 2 hour flick (cause no way the 2nd film is just them fighting to prevent Spot from killing the dad. That's atleast the first third), perhaps he intends to get rid of all anomalies to ""save"" the multiverse, with Mayday and Miles being an obstacle in that goal.

Also was Miguel ever vampire-like in the comics? I dont recall it from the old Spiderman games from the Wii era... actually, wasnt there some multiverse vampire villain that fought spiderpeople in the comics? Maybe the Miguel in this film is secretly that villain, with the twist being that the real Miguel was the one who died in his backstory.",2023-06-04

"I mean they were married before and then split up, right?",2023-06-05
"The only thing I didn't like about it is that nobody asked the question ""when is it enough?""

Like, Miles already lost his uncle. *That* was his major loss event that drove him to be Spiderman. What sense does it make for him to have to also lose his dad? By that logic, Spider-people are just fated to have their loved ones constantly ripped from their lives, over and over.

I kept wanting Miles to look at Peter with his daughter and go ""Okay, what if you had to lose Uncle Ben *and her*? Would you be cool with that? Is that *just fate*?""",2023-06-03

It honestly was. We had to stop taking the kids to see Marvel movies the last few years because they’re not made for kids or families anymore and they’ve been bummed.

"I was crying through almost the entire Gwen intro. For so many reasons. I've been a massive Spider-Gwen fan since her books started and I never thought I'd see her story play out in a movie. Then the watercolor art style kicked in and I realized they were animating her scenes just like much of her cover art. Then it hit me that they were going through her whole origin. It was weird because I never felt strongly reading it, but I started bawling both when Peter died and when Captain Stacy turned on her. I knew it was coming but that just made it worse. They really did her justice and Hailee did such a great job.

Seeing the Mary Jane's was surreal. I'm wondering if we'll ever get Gwenom and/or Carnage Mary Jane in the all female spinoff that's been talked about.",2023-06-05

Her dimensions visuals and the audio to it was something else.,2023-06-04
OH DAMN IT'S MORE LEAPS OF FAITH.,2023-06-02
I would say Into the Spiderverse is also partially a Peter B Story. He was divorced from MJ and depressed in ITSV. We see him a happy father in ATSV. I think it more likely that we get a spotlight on Miguel. I could even see a cold open like this one with Gwen where we flash back to the first canon-breaking event with Peter B and experience that first hand.,2023-06-03
I don't know if that's the case. Her story is almost exactly like the comics and her father never died in the books. At least not yet.,2023-06-05
"This confused me, bc I thought the canon was Spider-men just needed to have someone close to them die, not necessarily a police Captain. A lot of times it's Uncle Ben, but it could be anyone close to that particular spiderman. In these movies, Gwen had her Peter die and Miles already lost his uncle, so why did his dad have to die as well?",2023-06-25
It's okay it isn't complete isn't it?  Because complete would just mean not telling such a good story.  More will come.,2023-06-05

You stab him in the ~~kidney~~ face-void,2023-06-05
"The Spot has always been one of those characters that constantly gets clowned on for having a dumb name and silly character design, but is absolutely terrifying if you actually stop to think about the implications of his powers and what he can do.

In other words, he was the perfect choice for a villain that no one takes seriously until they suddenly have to.",2023-06-02
"It's amazing what a little echo effect and the right tone can do to turn someone from a ""villain of the week"" into a ""multiversal threat"". And the way he used his powers while fighting the Spider Folk was awesome.

Really interested to see what they do with him in Beyond.",2023-06-02
I like that the trailers kind of red-herring'd his character a bit. Playing up the early goofy scenes to get people thinking he was the wacky Act 1 sideshow keeping Miles busy before the real threat reveals itself.,2023-06-02
I like how his entire motive is just trying to get powerful enough to be a worthy nemesis for Miles.,2023-06-02

"Same can be said about Tobi (>!Obito!<) from the Naruto series, also started off as a good person and then later shifted to a serious and intimidating person.",2023-06-10
reminded me of him as bad guy in Scott Pilgrim,2023-06-10
He's good at that kind of thing.,2023-06-11
Also can we talk about casting?,2023-06-15
Just saw him in Asteroid City. I had no idea the same actor was playing such different roles. Killed it in both.,2023-07-03
He seems like such a non issue until he gets angry and becomes terrifying.,2023-09-03
And they created each other like he said,2023-06-02
">Both of them weren't taken seriously by the people around them, until all of a sudden, they became the nexus of the multiverse's problems.

I don't really believe Miles is the problem, though. The Spider Society thinks he is the problem, but everything ties back to Spot playing with forces beyond his comprehension, unknowingly giving Spiderman his powers and creating the situations that lead to his own powers. Miles only reacts to what he thinks is right and got bit through random chance.",2023-06-02
"They’re also thematic parallels as well.  The powers that Spot gained changed him in ways that pushed his family and “real” life away.  He goes on to embrace the “holes” that make him special, and seeks to further distance himself from what he loves by traveling the multiverse to gather more emptiness.  Miles’ new life also threatens his family and close relationships, and he travels the multiverse trying to fill that hole with more of what makes him special—namely by bonding with more Spider Folks.  But in doing so, he discovers that what they’re doing is holding on to their own loss and emptiness (their holes) by pushing it as the “correct” narrative.  He even finds the version of himself at the end that has suffered that loss, and that version too was transformed into a villain.",2023-06-05
it be funny if he was always meant be his nemesis also miles electric power is hacks,2023-06-02
"And they mirror one another in a Yin and Yang kind of way.

The Spot uses his powers to create havoc and without it he is essentially hollow, devoid of life as he obsess to destroy everything Miles hold dearly. 

Miles sees his powers as a gift and despite not fitting in initially, he chose to become his own unique person striving to do good in what he does best.",2023-06-02
"Miles is definitely the main character of the universe of the movie that we're watching, which is a meta thing that's just kind of inevitably there.",2023-06-07

"Oh shit! I'm dumb, aren't I?

The big twist is that Spot was supposed to be Spider-Man, right? But Miles ""stole"" his spider.

Man, my plot senses were NOT tingling during the film itself. I was just there for the rollercoaster on the first watch.

Edit: Yes, confirmed dumb.",2023-06-03
It's why I think Mikes is going to seek him out in the next film.,2023-09-03
BAGEL! was classic. And I cracked up in this one when Miles patted The Spot on the head and the comic-style exclamation was “GOOD COW”,2023-06-02

So going back in the sequels and saying that bagel guy eventually turned into the Spot and the design flaw was specifically made to destroy the Death Star, are retcons.

Just cause comicbooks have *retcon* so much shit and so poorly that “retcon” no longer has the neutral meaning it started out with, doesn’t change that OP is right to call those two things that people liked, retcons.",2023-06-02

"It's a terrible one, in fact. The Death Star flaw was always that it was an exhaust port.

Rogue One actually kinda makes it worse because proposes that the exhaust port that is near impossible to hit and requires the most suicide mission of suicide missions (and even then couldn't be hit with a targeting computer) was actually a deliberate choice by someone trying to destroy it and the main weakness. And then you have to ask why Galen designed such a shitty vulnerability?",2023-06-14

I also noticed during my second viewing that a blueprint for the prowler glove was taped to the side of his desk.",2023-06-10
For me it was the rain difference,2023-06-03
"I have a weird catch. When he's at his dad's party there is a VERY brief scene where you can see his suit neck is slightly showing on a side view and then when his parents confront him the black suit neck isn't there. Either I'm remembering things incorrectly, it was a blooper, or playing with time will be a big part of the next movie.",2023-06-09
"It's like that sliders episode where he's home but the gate doesn't squeak and the golden gate bridge is blue.


Fan fucking tastic film.",2023-06-04
Funny I thought that was just a homage to his uncle with him finally revealing the secret,2023-06-03
Purple jacket with a green jacket over it too,2023-06-04
It did occur to me once. The green and purple were reminding me of Prowler and Green Goblin.,2023-06-04
"Whenever I saw it, I thought he was just wearing his uncles jacket and kept it for remembrance, completely caught me off guard realizing it was his own multiverse self’s coat",2023-06-05
"Purple and green, just like prowler.",2023-06-11
the purple jacket felt weird weird to me and i didn’t get why at the time,2023-06-04
And his mother's eyes are green when in his universe they are brown.,2023-06-09
I thought that was hinting at the Green Goblin haha,2023-06-03
Damn I didn’t even catch that.,2023-06-04
"Apparently, his mom's eyes are a different color as well.

(I say apparently because I'm monochromatic color blind)",2023-06-09
do you have an example? trying to find,2023-06-23
"I thought I was losing my mind. I had caught the 42 in the machine but the scene was played so straight I thought I must've missed something. 

When Gwen entered Miles' empty room, it was a straight gut punch. What a great way to do the reveal.",2023-06-02
I honestly forgot because they kept showing 42 throughout the last movie and this one.,2023-06-02
Miles' universe is 1610 not 6106.,2023-06-02
"I saw it said Earth 42, but I didn't remember what his universe was. I'm going to blame the sound mixing, too, I guess. But it helped me get sucked into that awesome twist, so I can't complain.",2023-06-02
42 is the answer to the ultimate question. Earth 42 will be key for fixing the Spiderverse and finally giving Spiderpeople the happiness they deserve.,2023-06-05
"So did the avatar girl with the puffs (didn’t catch her Spider-name) know he was going to 42? I thought she was helping him out when she didn’t reboot the sequence, but maybe it was more of a “fuck it, let him go there instead of home”",2023-06-04
"Yeah I spotted this and felt that for me, and anyone who did spot it, it kinda took the edge off what might have been an exciting twist. Once you had an inkling it became pretty obvious, Gwen and Miles never being in the same shot etc..",2023-06-02
'Go home machine' made me smile,2023-06-04
"My brother caught that and was very excited to point it out to me! It was a lot of fun watching it together because we pieced the twists together lol, Miles not belonging in Spider Society because he was bitten by the wrong spider clicked the moment they talked about how they couldn't work with him for me",2023-06-11
"Yeah I assumed they had a different numeration and simply used 42 because the spider had the number, but I totally forgot they mentioned the spider came from another universe.",2023-06-02
Not everyone is remembering numbers on the fly,2023-06-02
I caught that but didn’t put two and two together until the reveal a few minutes later.,2023-06-08
"Yeah, I caught up on that too, so I thought he wanted to see his alternate self and probably warn or save him from whatever was going on with multiverse shenanigans. Had no idea Miles-1610 didn't realize he was in the wrong universe until he started talking to his mom.",2023-06-07
"Also on the right hand side of the scene, there are schematics for the prowler gloves on his wardrobe.",2023-06-23
It comes up in massive letters when he makes it to the universe....,2023-06-15
I saw that and immediately wondered what was happening 🤣,2023-06-02
"Yeah I caught that and freaked out. When he was talking to his mom I thought he had gone back to his own universe, but the spider powers went to universe-42 so he wasn't spiderman anymore as it were.",2023-06-12
"I kinda laughed when she said ""Who is Spiderman?"" thinking she just doesn't use the Internet, or read the news somehow. But then a few seconds later... oh shit that wasn't a joke!",2023-06-02
"An author that I like wrote a blog post about how to write surprise and mystery. He said initially he tried to make the hints subtle, but people didn't get it. Eventually he just makes the hints insanely obvious, but as long as you don't explicitly spell out the answer, people will prefer to continue to read than stop and evaluate. This was that moment. So many hints, but the movie kept going and so I didn't think about it.",2023-06-02
Miles' parents watched the news of Spiderman's death in the first movie so she definitely knew. But in the moment I just assumed she was just being a bit clueless about superheroes and which is which.,2023-06-03
"This would have been such a cool thing for me to figure out and a memorable cinema moment (eg, realizing Strange never told Wanda the name America Chavez during their conversation in the trees in DS2:MOM)

But a girl a few rows ahead of me loudly said 'ohhhhhh he's in the wrong dimension' and ruined the realization for me.",2023-06-08
Glad I wasn’t the only one lmfao,2023-06-14
and the fact that she mentions comic con but in the first movie miles doesn't know what it is because his universe doesn't have it,2023-06-02
"I was a little disappointed they could have used the toy Gwen took out of the package being back in the package as a signal to Miles that he was in the wrong universe, it was so perfectly set up!",2023-06-02
Same.  They played that scene perfectly.,2023-06-08
Yep that’s when I figured it out. Earth 42s mom had green eyes when the OG mom had brown eyes.,2023-06-02
"Omfg I just realized I had noticed eyes and thought ""wow is that an animation mistake?"" I am so dumb",2023-06-04
[deleted],2023-06-02
It was ironic to have such a beautiful art style for her universe and we all wanted to see more from it until you realize she’s miserable in that universe so you don’t want her to go back,2023-06-03
"This is how the covers of her early comics looked. It's not a stylistic choice, it's a distinct homage.",2023-06-02
"And how they both had opposing color motifs (he was warm colors against warm background, she had cooler colors and her room was the same) to show that separation between them, but in the end they shared the same color palette when they finally reconciled.",2023-06-04
It reminded me of a game called Gris.  beautiful little platformer that did similar things with watercolor and emotional highs/lows.,2023-06-06
"I need to get my Marvel Unlimited subscription back up and running, I always meant to check it out and just never did.",2023-06-02
There was a Easter egg to EEAAO in the movie! There’s a blink and you’ll miss it shot of a billboard that says “ALL OF IT ALWAYS ALL OVER THE PLACE” with a bagel in the middle.,2023-06-05
"Haha I also thought on that!

This (and the whole Spider-Verse) and EEAO did the multiverse the correct way, hands down!",2023-06-04
The eerie whistle motif when Uncle Aaron-42 shows up. Was really terrifying.,2023-06-02
"I loved the Prowler's theme in the first one, I got chills hearing it come back at the end",2023-06-05
"It'd be hilarious if two multiverse movies won in a row.

But yeah, literally zero chance of best picture. Reddit is wilding. It'll run well for best animation, if not win.",2023-06-07
the last one won,2023-06-02
also wasn't even a complete story,2023-06-11
"That’s the best type of plot twist though. It’s literally right in front of people but in a hectic moment so many people (like myself lol) will have missed it. Some will have picked up on it when his mum is confused (me), when he glitches the first time, right up until he spells it out. 

Great twist.",2023-06-05
"Tbh, a lot of people I went with didn’t realize. I didn’t at first but my friend pointed it out. Even after knowing, I was waiting anxiously for the shoe to drop. So them including it didn’t ruin the moment for me or my friend.",2023-06-25
Yeah I was confused why people are viewing this as a twist and why they kinda played it that way. The 42 is very plainly there and they make a point of saying where everyone is from. The reveal didn’t work for me it was more so waiting for miles to figure it out,2023-06-06
Especially when there is Dune 2 and Oppenheimer releasing in the next few months. But I can totally see it winning the Best Animated Film category like the first part.,2023-06-02
9.999/10 it's my favourite film in long time but God damn... some of dialogs were hard to hear. Many are complaining about in this thread and they're right.,2023-06-05
"Yes plot twists are often shown right in front of you and ppl still miss them or wouldn't register.

A trope as old as Agatha Christie.",2023-06-04
Facts like it was literally shown,2023-06-04
There are dozens of Spectacular Spider-Man fans. DOZENS!!!! (Regularly get the theme song stuck in my head from time to time).,2023-06-02
"I’m sold, queuing up the first episode on Disney+ now.",2023-06-02
"Real shit.

Any time I think of it, the possibilities of what could be haunt me.


So anytime I rewatch I usually just rewatch the first season cause it's got a happy ending


But I think Spectacular Spider-Man will be my favorite Spider-Man for all time.",2023-06-02
It's the best interpretation of Spider-Man to date.,2023-06-03
We got to see a little bit of his future in this film - we saw his Spider-Man watch Captain Stacy die.,2023-06-04
"Well, canonically he is pretty short, standing at around 5' 6"", as he mentions in Season 1 Episode 3 when on the hunt for Lizard.

I think he says something along the lines of ""If I were a 6' 5"" Lizard instead of a 5' 6"" Spider, where would I hide?"".  


Honestly, I'm really happy with how short they made him look as it shows the level of the attention to detail in this movie.",2023-06-11
What did Yuri say?,2023-06-02
"Now give us Season 3! (Yes, I'm still coping)",2023-06-02
"yeah completely new and not a part of the show. now after that, at least we know one thing that happened after the final episode lol",2023-06-02
Pour one out for the boy,2023-06-03
"The crazy thing is that Captain Stacy is actually still alive by the end of the show, so this confirms he eventually dies.",2023-06-04
That was josh? I honestly thought it was jason marsden (goofy’s son max) in suzume. Good for him.,2023-06-04
"I was thinking the same thing leaving the theatre! 

SPOILERS FOR BOTH ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE & FF7 REMAKE: >!Gwen’s arc in particular regarding whether to side with Miles or Miguel felt reminiscent of Aerith’s implied arc in Remake.!<",2023-06-07
"I was so happy to see the show acknowledged in one of the background clips, but then when Josh Keaton also had lines as Spectacular Spidey I was 🤯",2023-06-14
"I believe he showed up as one of the ""Cleaning Crew"" Spideys, alongside Assassin Spider-Man",2023-06-04
Yeah I don't think anyone is touching that Spider-man with a ten foot spider-pole,2023-06-06
You missed the whole point of the movie…,2023-06-06
"That was my thought too! I saw Infinity War opening night and how quiet the theater was at the end still gives me goosebumps. I thought then ""this is the new age Empire Strikes Back"".

This movie being able to ring that bell again is the cherry on top for me.",2023-06-02
"It didn’t matter to me, at the end of IW I was emotionally devastated, nothing before of since had affected me as much and I’m still not sure how or why.",2023-06-02
"Yeah I had no idea, I figured there was at least 40 minutes left, which is a good thing to be honest.

But the yells of disbelief from my showing lmao, I won't forget that any time soon.",2023-06-03
I wasn’t aware this was a Part 1 so I was caught completely and totally by surprise. As was the girl who screamed “oh my god” when it happened.,2023-06-04
"Infinity War also wrapped up most of its plot points by the end of the movie. Yes, people had this general idea that the survivors would get their revenge on Thanos somehow, but that could've been in two or twenty movies.

This movie doesn't. Of all its plot threads, only one gets any sort of resolution by the end of the movie.

And I'm really getting tired of this trend of movies hiding that they're two-parters in the general marketing. First it happened with Dune, and now this, though at least Dune lets you know at the beginning of the movie that you only shelled out money for half the story instead of making you wait until the end.",2023-06-04
I wouldn’t have seen it if I knew this was a two parter.,2023-06-04
Still need to see Baahubali. RRR was incredible. Wish I saw it in theaters (we never had a theatrical release here),2023-06-04
Still say one of cinemas biggest tragedies is that baahubali got squashed into two movies and not three,2023-06-11
I’m with you. I loved the cliffhanger and thought the build to the end got me so hyped. Only downside is I can’t watch the next one but honestly I might go see this one in theatres again. Fucking awesome movie,2023-06-03
I was only disappointed because I thought we were five years out from another one. Big relief when I found out that we’ll get the resolution next year.,2023-06-04
"Man, I got actually mad excited as they were building to the end with the twists on Earth-42 and then you've got Gwen building her team and the music building up to it all and going right into the credits. Perfect way to end the film and get me mad excited for the next part in March. 

There were quite a few people in my screening tonight that were really pissed off with this and called the film ""shit"" or ""a waste of time"" when the credits rolled. Interesting to note the different reactions but for me, this movie fired on all cylinders and every shot delivered and perfectly fed into my hype for the next one.",2023-06-04
No they didn’t,2023-06-19
I was expecting it to still be in the box! That it wasn’t there made it better for me.,2023-06-04
Him being born is a canon event,2023-06-02
"Ha, I said that to my wife. He's the link that binds all the universes together.",2023-06-03
even Darin De Paul (JJJ in the Insomniac Games) emulates JK Simmons really hard. He has become the reference point for all JJJ performance.,2023-06-02
Has been for years really.,2023-06-02
He is a passive canon event,2023-06-02
"Then when they swung by the training room the Doc Oc went “Hello, Peter.”",2023-06-07
"Shit, his universe probably had a captain Stacey, too.",2023-06-05
But isn’t his canon event his uncle dying? I guess someone else usually dies in-universes too,2023-06-03
"his universe's canon events are already disrupted so why does it matter if miles continues to disrupt the canon. it's already doomed anyway, apparently. idk. speculative rules like this are a big reason why i get annoyed by multiverse movies.

also, i don't understand why evil miles's universe was able to continue to exist when its canon events were disrupted.",2023-07-12
We're hopefully going to find out at least some of his theories are just wrong in part 3.,2023-06-02
Yeah it seems obvious to me that Miguel either doesn't know enough or is lying on some level about the canon events. We see earth 42 where the canon was broken is perfectly fine,2023-06-03
"i liked this movie but the unreliable and nebulous nature of the multiverse laws remove a lot of the script-traction I need in order to understand the stakes and the characters' options.  vague, slippery, or contradictory rules make it a lot harder to care or get invested.",2023-07-12
"but there isn't even a spider man in one of the universes, and it was just fine until miles came by. and i doubt he's gonna stay in that universe.",2023-07-12
Which part? I think all were stated at some point,2023-06-02
"You’re right, Two Towers has an ending and the story continues naturally. The entire climax is resolved with the battle at Helms Deep, the overarching story is shared across all three films, but each film has its own story to tell and doesn’t just abruptly dump you in the middle of the climax, it would be like cutting to black just as Gandalf arrives.",2023-06-02
Nobody is talking about Mrs. Chen !,2023-06-03
It seriously gave me whipslash. Wow.,2023-06-02
#donald4spiderman,2023-06-02
It wasn't even on my list,2023-06-02
Did not expect it at all,2023-06-03
Honestly thought we might get Tom Hardy's Venom,2023-06-05
seeing ganke playing spider-man ps4 at the dorm was fucking crazy,2023-06-02
No love for Spectacular Spider-Man?,2023-06-02
"There is even a very small reference to the Amazing Spider-man game back in 2012-13 too, that scene where Miguel shows all the multiverse where Uncle Ben died.",2023-06-02
"There was a Atari 2600 Green Goblin in the jail as well, but you'd probably need to be at least 45 years old to even realize the reference

It was the blocky green thing that most folks probably didn't even realize what it was, lol

We all knew we'd get a Spiderman PS4 in this movie but were we expecting *that* kind of cameo ? I wasn't and I giggled like a kid.,2023-06-02
"Couldn't hear Donald glover, was there a call back there I didn't catch?",2023-06-02
RIGHHHT?? AHH,2023-06-02
"I picked up on Ganke playing it, but what were the other references to the game?",2023-06-05
Don't forget Spectacular Spider-Man,2023-06-03
I wish they had ps4 spiderman make an actual cameo in the spidercity,2023-06-11
"Heck there was 2 references
- one was the Dorm Room
- other was the actual Spider Society scene where it has “Insomniac’s Spider-Man”",2023-06-20
yeaaaah I knowwwwww. Will he ever reference that in the game?,2023-06-11
Makes me think we might see Holland in Beyond. I saw Tobey and obviously Andrew but I don’t think I saw Holland.,2023-06-02
"Honestly, with this Sony could ""fix"" the plothole of having MCU Vulture in the Sonyverse

Just say, he was an anomaly caused by this multiversal fuck up and is swiftly dealt by one of the Spiders",2023-06-02
"What makes you say that? He isn’t the Prowler in the MCU, at least not yet.",2023-06-02
miles morales's creation is directly influenced by the original donald for spiderman campaign so its a great full circle moment to have him playing miles's uncle,2023-06-02
My hope is it's not a MoM kinda cameo where John Krasinski isn't gonna be Mr. Fantastic in the movie and we actually get Miles and Donal Glover Prowler in the MCU at some point.,2023-06-02
"SAME was the only one who gasped for Glover

& James Blake song ahahhaaa",2023-06-02
My theater collectively lost their shit,2023-06-02
Opposite in my theatre. There were cheers.,2023-06-02
"Surprisingly, we had a unanimous OMG followed with some applause in mine!",2023-06-02
"Oh, that stinks.  I saw this a few minutes ago with a very lively crowd and we all went apeshit.  It was great.",2023-06-02
"My theater flipped out when that happened. Also, Ben Riley's first scene. My audience knew their shit lol",2023-06-02
Pretty much the whole crowd gasped when I saw it tonight.,2023-06-02
Also him cheering Miles and booing the other Spider-Men,2023-06-03
"its fuckin crazy that Community, a niche and weird TV show from the early 2010's that didn't exactly break TV ratings but nonetheless had a very loyal fanbase, led to the creation of Miles Morales which led to the creation of an almost billion dollar animated movie franchise. The butterfly effect workin really hard to crank that one out huh. 🤣",2023-08-08
"Donald Glover played Aaron Davis (Miles’ uncle who turns out to be the Prowler) in Spider-Man:  Homecoming. It was kind of subtle if you didn’t recognize the name of the character because he’s not in the Prowler outfit in the movie, but he does mention that he has a nephew in that scene. So, it was cool to finally see him suited up.

The second layer is some aspects of Miles Morales’ creation were heavily inspired by Donald Glover. There was a push on social media for him to be cast as Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-Man. In reference to this, he showed up in Spider-Man pajamas in a Community episode*.  That inspired Brian Michael Bendis and Sarah Pichelli when designing comic book Miles.  So, in Homecoming and this film it’s also a nod to his influence on the creation of the character.",2023-06-02
How? It's 2 different universes lol.,2023-06-02
"Totally possible. If Miles was 7 when Aaron mentioned him in Homecoming, he'd be 13 in 2023 (assuming he didn't get blipped). If they need to, they could say Miles was a baby when his uncle mentioned him, and he got blipped, and push 13 for him out to ~2035.",2023-06-03
Maybe not soon but it will happen eventually,2023-06-03
"Rumours are he's going to appear in Spider-man 4. Apparently he's going to be Peter Parkers neighbour. 

My guess is he will appear and in an end credits scene get bit by the spider.",2023-06-04
Donald Glover plays Aaron Davis in the MCU (Homecoming).,2023-06-02
"after no way home it‘s been straight up bad

thor was an abomination (how can you waste christian fckin bale) and dr strange was just an ok movie

i dont have hope till the next spiderman movie tbh cause even the avengers wont make me care much anymore",2023-06-02
"NWH, Shang-Chi, and GOTG3 were excellent.

Black Widow, Wakanda Forever, and Dr. Strange were mid.

Thor Love and Thunder, Ant Man Quantumania, and Eternals were bad.",2023-06-05
I wonder if this movie is technically part of Phase 4/5. they explicitly mentioned strange and earth 616 incident.,2023-06-03
I think the shows have been great. Loki and Wandavision,2023-06-07
It's been rough since Age of Ultron.,2023-06-05
"> If only Marvel just went balls to wall with the Multiverse

Wouldn't blame this one on Marvel, but pop culture media. 

Marvel Studios wanted to do this well over 10-years ago, but the pre-screening reporters criticized the idea of having multiple of the same variants of characters in the same universe, stating that ""it's too confusing for the casual audience and general viewers"" 

Now, 10 years later, it is all anyone wants to watch. Everyone wants a multiverse, look at Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.

Russian Dolls has a spin on alternate universes, lots of media today is bandwagon on a tool that has been around since comic book creation. 

10 years ago, reporters called us (general audience) too naive to understand multiverses to even want to purchase the movie ticket to begin with.",2023-06-02
"> DC's best recent movie is Joker 

I think The Batman is better. Hopefully James Gunn actually gives DC some coherence.",2023-06-04
"IMO those are the best comic book stories. Spider-man blue, i forget which issue it was but there was one where spider-man gets trapped in the subway with JJJ's dad. He played out an imaginary game with a cancer patient to make him feel better. Shit that just shows spider-man is just a guy trying to make the world a better place no matter seemingly small it was compared to the rest of the universe. I wish a TV show would focus more on that instead of ""monster of the week"" type stuff. (I'm looking at you Spider-Man (2017). Give me back spectacular damn it!)",2023-06-03
So you wanted Ang Lee's Hulk. Lol,2023-06-04
"There’s the X Men and Fantastic 4 incoming. 

The Avengers have always been B listers compared to those 2 groups.

Saying the story is told, is some casual comic book fan logic.",2023-06-05
Wow same and I thought it was a problem with the theatre haha,2023-06-02
Saaaame! I honestly thought I was going crazy or deaf because no one else seemed confused,2023-06-02
Same for me. The opening fight scene with Gwen and pretty much all of Spider-Punk’s dialogue was very low. Weird because I also watched it in a Dolby theatre which I never had problems with.,2023-06-03
Same here!! This is simultaneously very reassuring and disconcerting lol,2023-06-03
I understood maybe two or three of Spider-Punk’s lines throughout the whole movie lol,2023-06-05
Same here. Could barely understand Spider-Punk which was a shame from all these comments I’m seeing.,2023-06-05
"I think that was intentional. She didn’t say anything really important (it was stuff we already knew) but I think it was supposed to signify getting lost in the music and how she couldn’t hear her own thoughts. 

SpiderPunk was probably bad mixing lol",2023-06-05
Dolby Cinema seems to be okay.,2023-06-04
You guys have to watch it in a Dolby Cinena. Impeccable sound. Hands down the best movie this year,2023-06-02
"Just an fyi, I saw it on release Friday and had that issue, and then I saw it again last night (Wednesday) with my SO and the sound seemed to be a lot better. I was able to catch (almost) all of Hobie’s lines this time!!",2023-06-08
"yeah this is going to be a pain in the ass as someone who works at a theatre, having to keep turning the audio up and down before and after this movie shows.",2023-06-02
"I’m so glad both this and the above comment addressed this- almost walked out in the beginning thinking it was just the cinema I’m in. The mixing was awful, not sure I heard a single “thwip” sound effect in the whole movie as things were so quiet. Missed a lot of dialogue too especially from Punk. A real shame considering how great it looked, I hope they fix it for future releases.",2023-06-02
"I thought the mix was weird during her drumming monologue too, but the rest of the movie seemed fine to me",2023-06-02
"Ok I thought I was being too picky but, many times I felt like the sound wasn’t immersing me enough to the action of the film. I reside in Las Vegas, NV.",2023-06-02
Same here. She sounded far away,2023-06-02
I felt like it reversed in my theater. She was hard to hear in the opening but then during the Vulture fight the voices were loud and everything else felt quiet. Eventually I stopped paying attention to that because the movie sucked me in.,2023-06-02

Yeah happened to me too. Then i just got accustomed to it,2023-06-03
"Her monologue at the end was also quite quiet and that may have actually ruined the ending for me (not that I think it's bad, just that I didn't get the conclusive feeling I should have at the end).

Apparently my theater got the memo. Shit was so loud the whole time.,2023-06-10
Just saw it for the first time today and the mix was still not great :/,2023-07-03
I could hear it just about but it was weirdly mellow and quiet even for the tone of the monologue itself.,2023-06-02
Don't think it's a movie issue; seems like a theatre mixing issue. I just saw it and thought the music was almost too quiet in that scene. No issues with the dialog. Hopefully theaters figure it out going forward,2023-06-02

"Yeah, it was mostly just bad at the beginning, during some action scenes later on, and with Spider-Punk. I was worried at first that I would barely able to hear anything throughout the whole movie, but *most* of it was at least ok. Sucks that there were issues at all, though.",2023-06-05

>Or no one explained why they didnt tell Miles he was an anamoly. Maybe don't mention the dad but if they had explained to him the spider-verse maybe he wouldn't have recklesly followed Gwen.

Gwen didn't want to hurt Miles' feelings by telling him he wasn't supposed to become Spider-Man. If you have gone through a whole hero's journey to become a superhero (particularly one with all the selflessness do-good baggage of Spider-Man), it would be kinda devastating if your transdimensional gf told you you were an accident. No one else told him because they didn't know Gwen visited him in the first place. And furthermore, they didn't want him ever knowing because, as an anomaly, they didn't trust Miles to begin with.",2023-06-07
"Spot doesn't misunderstand spidey. He knew exactly what his job was and he knows spidey broke the collider. He doesn't care if it was a for a good reason and heck he wasn't even that me about it.

Did you not watch the movie? They literally had a daughter together,2023-06-05
"Re-read the start of my comment:

>One of the biggest criticisms of the Spider-Man comics *in recent years*

Emphasis on the last three words. 

For the longest time, Peter did get to have a lot of character development and natural progression through different stages of his life (high school, college, getting married with MJ, etc), which opened the door for a lot of new and interesting stories/conflicts to be told. It's one of the reasons why the initial run of Ultimate Spider-Man is so popular - even if it's not perfect, it allowed Peter Parker and his supporting cast to grow and develop in a manner that was organic and satisfying.

The issue is that, after One More Day, Marvel has almost been afraid to let Peter have any of that progression - hell, one of the main reasons One More Day is so hated is because of how it undid decades of storytelling and development to effectively reset Peter's life and relationships back to square one. In the decade and a half since then, not only have they not really made any progress in undoing the damage done by that story, but it almost feels like they're going out of their way to keep that from happening (*glares at Paul*).",2023-06-04
"Go away, Paul.",2023-06-04
"I legit thought that the intro was so long, like took forever before Miles goes into Spider Lair and another while before he starts getting beef with Miguel. Before I knew the movie was over…",2023-06-11
I was wondering why the colors looked so different! But I just thought to myself maybe the world looks like this because it's night time and Miles is in a hurry or something. That was nicely done.,2023-06-02
"Also because you could see that the machine said ""Earth-42"" when it scanned his DNA",2023-06-02
I thought it was just Miles' emotions until the pin dropped for me when Gwen couldn't find Miles in his room.,2023-06-02
"Yeah Earth 42 had those greens and purples going on which did make me suspicious 

It was a great twist though",2023-06-02

"Yeah I was like “huh the rain looks different in this than usual” when he immediately lands there. But I was like “hmmm maybe I’m just getting mixed up cuz we’ve been in so many universes I’ve forgotten what his normal universe is like”

Sure enough…",2023-06-02
"You could see the Earth-42 when he was scanned.

Also, the little details in his ""room"". There wasn't any art, claw schematics, and the jacket he puts on his purple and green.",2023-06-02
"Also, his mom had different color eyes in U-42: *Green*. 

They were very noticeable gold in Miles real universe- the same color as his own.",2023-06-02
I do wonder if the characters themselves are aware of the different art styles. If they are I really wanna see Don Glover's reaction to being captured by cartoons 😂,2023-06-02
They did what I wanted Quantiumania to do at the end. You could just feel something was off,2023-06-02

It wasn’t a twist if you noticed the machine read earth 42 before sending him. I was waiting for Miles to figure it out.,2023-06-02
Another tell is the mom being surprised that Mikes changed his hair!,2023-06-02
I also saw the 42 on the screen before he teleported. That was a pretty big hint.,2023-06-02

I’ve seen too many movies and the set up for this was blatantly obvious to me but I’m glad it landed for most people.,2023-06-02
I didn't catch that. I did notice as soon as Miles' 42 mom opened the door that his jacket had the color scheme and pattern that reminded a lot to the Prowler.,2023-06-02
Great *Silence of the Lambs* cutting with Miles and Gwen too.,2023-06-02
"At first, I had no clue. They were showing clips of Miles' universe raining, and it looked the same as Earth 42; however, when Miles started speaking to his mom, it was off. Her eyes had this lifeless drab green look in her eye and then her reaction to saying who was spiderman was the instant realization that he was in the wrong universe for me",2023-06-02
"bro I thought it was lowkey just raining when he got back, that's why it was all dark and gloom.  


NOPE",2023-06-02

For me it's when the Mom said comic con because miles doesn't know about comic con in his universe,2023-06-03

"I absolutely noticed the world looked different but I put it down to the multiverse collapsing. 
And I already thought the universe had started collapsing due to the melting colours in Gwens scene with her dad.

Apparently the multiverse isn’t collapsing at all just yet so the twist got me good.

I wonder if that was what the makers were aiming for?",2023-06-18
Since the third film is called Beyond the Spider-Verse I'm guessing that's an apt description for what's gonna come next? I mean the world Miles was left in didn't have a Spider Man so that's technically Beyond the Spider Verse.,2023-06-02
Imo they should have kept the part numbers for audience members who don’t follow movie news/watch the first trailer,2023-06-02
"I think I remember reading how movies are trying to not label anything ""Part 1&2."" Dune avoided part 1 in all the marketing and you only see it in the credits. They supposedly did this because of all the mediocre releases of part 1&2 movies following the success of Harry Potter splitting the last book into 1&2 for the movies.",2023-06-04
I'm kinda glad they didn't. Feel like the end would be less shocking,2023-06-02
Any reason why they dropped it? Do part 1 2 labels do worse for movies in the box office? Felt like this wasn’t an infinity war endgame type where they didn’t need part 1 and 2,2023-06-03

I think I witnessed a magical moment, a young girl falling in love with film, or at least realizing that art could be pretty special. What a great fucking movie.",2023-06-11
"My eyes were so glued to the screen that I saw ""42"" on the monitor of the machine and knew what was happening before he even entered that universe. Not trying to brag that I'm some gigabrain filmgoer - I wouldn't say I'm typically great at this sort of thing.",2023-06-05
It was also telegraphed by the fact that they literally showed a shot of the screen saying he was being sent to earth 42.,2023-06-05
I was very very upset and wish I knew that it was very much a part one but I think it's something that pissed me off in the moment but I'll get over it with time and enjoy the movie just as much.,2023-06-05

"I reckon Earth-42 was never meant to have a Spider-Man (or not yet), it’s why it hasn’t collapsed in on itself. The spider was supposed to go to Miles’ world, and Peter B Parker was a canon event for Miles.

 If it wasn’t, Miles’ world would have collapsed. 

Miguel is either ignoring the “rules” of the films on purpose because he *is* shady, or he’s too obsessed with keeping control that he blinds himself with rage when he encounters what he considers an “anomaly.”

Also: if you want to preserve the fucking multiverse why create an agency that fucks with the multiverse? The only world-ending shit we see is because of him or his company’s bracelets. I’m betting Miguel is the anomaly that is tearing the worlds at their seams.

"Maybe Miguel wouldn’t be able to find the correct person? It’s not always Peter Parker. In fact, Peter Parker sometimes ends up dead. I also think part of canon is that a spider bite leads to powers. Or something unexpected / out of the spider person’s control.

Had the whole theatre laughing,2023-06-02
Is he wrong tho?,2023-06-15
"Hobie really said, “you’re him, Miles don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”",2023-06-02
"He also said ""make your own watch"" then followed through, made one, and got it to Gwen",2023-06-02
Sometimes the best mentors come from unlikely places.,2023-06-02
"What's also great about how he's handled is that prior to the release of the movie there was speculation that there was going to be a love triangle between him, Gwen and Miles. And the movie does seem to be going that way initially when she drops his name and Miles gets a bit jealous. Then he's ultimately introduced by bursting through the barrier that Miles is trying to break. But it never actually goes there. He's looking out for Gwen just as he's trying to look out for Miles.",2023-06-02
"That part got me to yell out in the theater.

&#x200B;

When Miles is getting trapped in the force field thing, Spider Punk shows his palms to Miles to remind him to use his palms to break out.

I yelled.

I don't think I've EVER yelled in a movie before.

In Spain we got the ""punk truck driver"" a really famous person and he is full authoritarian support of the governament against any anti-establishment people. He wears like a punk, talk like it and he has been seen with a fascist politian eating at the restaurant. I was worried this ""spider-punk"" will be the same, pure talk but in the end he is just establishment but no, he delivered",2023-06-14
"It's a cool character designed to be likeable, the opposite that Miguel that represents authoritarianism. This is why Hobart helps Miles and Gwen, to challenge authority.

I thought he be more chill and laid back but guess not lol also guess movie removed miguel mind reading ability miles electric ability seems more op also miguel using his upgraded suit and he seems more weaker because he started a new life with family if u read comic he not suppose that nice lol,2023-06-02

"Sony: Spider-Man must not be homosexual

Sony Pictures Animation: Okay.",2023-06-04
Tbf Hobie in the comics IS gay. So enjoy man,2023-06-02
"I already thought Miles was bi because of something I read waaayyy back when he first debuted. So, I was sitting through this movie wondering if they would have the guts to reveal Miles as bi.

I also thought it would be funny if Gwen, Hobie and Miles became a thruple who went about tearing down the establishment in their further adventures.",2023-06-05
"Because since the moment they're introduced, Hobie treats Miles with admiration and respect, instead of a rival or someone that he needs to undermine. 

The first he does is gives Myles advice, then during the rest of their adventure in Mumbathan he's following Myles lead, he congratulates him when he saves the captain, and so on. Myles is experiencing the same we do as the audience in regards to Hobie.",2023-06-20
I honestly think he realized that basically Hobie is a cool guy. It's hard to be mad at or jealous of someone you respect and who respects you back equally,2023-07-01
Yep. Nothing more punk than breaking the canon.,2023-06-04

The only problem I had with this movie, especially during Gwen's opening monologue and Spider-Punk's intro.

Same. It's as if they didn't turn on the Dolby sound for this movie.,2023-06-02
"I also watched in Dolby and felt like I had no issues hearing people at all, except for one line that I can’t remember anyway. The metaphor for capitalism took my brain a second to process before I laughed, but no one else did, so it’s totally possible I was just ignoring any sound issues, because I was personally blown away by the soundtrack and general audio.",2023-06-02
I think that was just spider-punk. Miles could barely understand him either.,2023-06-02
"Same and saw it in Europe. I don't even remmeber if there were subtitles, but sound was damn low, then boom, then low, very Nolan.",2023-06-02
Yeah my theater was fine for the middle chunk of the movie but the first 15-20 minutes and the last 15-20 minutes was bad.,2023-06-05
"The main issues are that 7/7.5 is really loud, and that the mix itself isn't great with the Centre speakers which are usually reserved for dialogue being too low in the mix. If you turn everything up then it doesn't make it any clearer, sure you might hear the dialogue more but the rest will be painfully loud.",2023-06-03
Yes! So much echo!,2023-06-02

He is totally based off Bob vylan and if not it’s a spot on representation,2023-06-02
Which is interesting because his daughter is MJ,2023-06-02
"I actually don't think so because a big part of this was that Miles basically saved him from being a part of the ""tragic Spider-Man story"" he essentially saved his innocence. I feel like they won't kill him",2023-06-03
It’ll deff probably be something based on his vampirism but that’s a lot of story to deal with including Prowler Miles plus some mention of a sinister 6 cartel . Plus The Spot . Not even going into a potential spider-people civil war where some of them Defect with Drew and others stay loyal to Miguel,2023-06-03
It’s pretty interesting that both miles and Gwen are anomalies.,2023-06-11

He changes his own naive perspective and lays down his career in the name of family, leading her to realize how deep his love is for her and reconciling that w the also naive image she had drawn him up to be. It’s a satisfying arc for each of them that sort of parallels one another. Having her deal w the inevitable canon event of his death in a sequel would prolly feel redundant if they wanted miles to go thru a similar thing, so it was a smart idea to solve that problem in this movie instead of the finale",2023-06-14

The audio mixing didn't help. The beginning with Gwen drumming was very hard to hear too.,2023-06-03
There was a lot of dialogue that wasn’t coming through well. I barely heard some things Gwen was saying in the intro scene.,2023-06-04
It’s the accent tbf but surprisingly understood him,2023-06-03
Yupppp I missed this line,2023-06-05
I’m betting not the bland and generic sci-fi movie version we ended up with.,2023-06-03
I believe it's when the hole opens up in Mumbattan and that's what he responds with when Miles ask what it is,2023-06-02
It was when the black hole showed up towards the end of the Mumbattan sequence right before Jess Drew shows up. They look down over the cliff and someone asks what the hole is,2023-06-02
"Barely anyone laughed at my theater. I think the mix was off, like others have mentioned",2023-06-02
My theater also missed this line completely!,2023-06-03
He says it after Miles disrupts the Canon Event in Mumbattan and the universe starts to break down.,2023-06-05
"Peter never died in Earth-42, he's just a normal guy who was SUPPOSED to become Spider-Man, but never did (assuming that the spider was supposed to bite Peter)",2023-06-02
"That’ll probably be explained in the next movie. With Miles’ connection to Aaron, it’s possible he becomes the Prowler even if Spider-Man exists",2023-06-02
"I took it as if he doesn't get bit, he becomes Prowler in Earth-42. That spider was ""meant"" for him: he gets bit, gets powers, his dad dying is his Uncle Ben moment. But instead, it's sent to our Miles' universe, so after his dad dies, he turns to crime with his uncle. It's not that he becomes Prowler without Spider-Man, he becomes Prowler because HE'S not the Spider-Man of that universe.",2023-06-02
"That part doesn’t make much sense to. From Miguel’s pov, I completely understand how he made that jump. But the spider was pulled to his dimension and he didn’t really do anything to cause his Peter’s death. 

In the end, it all falls back to Kingpin, creating an anomaly to get his family back.",2023-06-02
"I loved that. Im a big fan of the first one and though it didnt hurt it at all it did sorta bother me that there would be two Spidermen, both bit by spiders, etc. So to explain that Miles wasn’t supposed to get bitten and what happened really surprised me. Towards the end the film just keeps laying on surprises and really grabs you so tight that it’s no wonder my audience went apeshit when it suddenly ended.",2023-06-02
There wasn't a Spider-Man because spider #42 was brought to Earth-1610.,2023-06-03
Well actually there is a scene for a brief second where the spider was approaching universe 42 Miles,2023-06-03
"Miles becomes the Prowler because HE doesn't become Spider-Man. Not because there isn't a Spider-Man at all. Since the spider left his universe, Peter is just a normal guy in Earth-42.",2023-06-02
Our theory is that Earth-42 Miles was supposed to be bitten but since he didn't he became the Prowler,2023-06-03
what if miles dad was suppose be spiderman in 42 which would explain why miguel is infuriated lol because he technically got 2 spiderman killed,2023-06-02
Its the Bendis Miles. His aaron is a dick. Prowler Miles was supposed to be spiderman!,2023-06-03
Phenomenal job moving from a joke to legitimately terrifying.,2023-06-02
"All interesting points! In ""our"" Mile's universe his Uncle Aaron was a good guy who made some bad decisions. Could it be that in the 42 universe their Miles was encouraged into Vigilantism as opposed to his Dad's ""law and order""?

Great setup for a third film!",2023-06-02
"I suspect that the ""solution"" to everything glitching is for Prowler Miles to eventually become the Spiderman of his universe",2023-06-03
The first thing he did when he met Miles was throw something at him. Instant dislike.,2023-06-03
"I think that's the point he's trying to make though. He already walked the path that Miles seems to be walking and he knows the huge consequences that doing so have.

Sure, we might get a plot twist later that because Miles himself is an anomaly he's not bounded by ""canon"" events, but I don't think anyone would want to gamble an entire universe for that, specially if you aren't seeing the big picture like the audience is.",2023-06-03

I want it to win this year, but its gonna have to go up against Mario (which it will beat), Elemental, Trolls, Wish, and Ninja Turtles.",2023-06-02
"This movie is too technically innovative not to win. It’s just so interesting to look at. Even more so than the first one.

ETA: someone pointed out that Miyazaki is putting out a movie this year, so maybe not. But if not, what a year.",2023-06-04
"Man, after seeing Spiderverse, I kinda feel sorry for Pixar. Sony straight up upended the entire medium of animation, and they're making the same ed nonsense we've been watching for a full decade plus at this point.",2023-06-04
Don't sleep on the turtles now.,2023-06-02
Elementals will have to have cosmic tier writing for them to win because the visuals we’ve seen are basic Disney cookie cutter,2023-06-02
I’m convinced that Elemental is just a psyop to make people who see the trailer think “wow I should rewatch ATLA”. And ya know what? It works.,2023-06-05
This beats all movies (animated *and* live action) of the last few years tbh.,2023-06-02
"This was so good that I'm hoping sony tries to launch a for your consideration campaign for Best Picture. It'd be nice to see an animated film get nominated for the big award again, especially after the beating the animation industry has taken the past few years.",2023-06-03
Ninja Turtles could be really good,2023-06-03
Elemental is getting mid reviews. We'll see how Wish turns out.,2023-06-02
Elemental is going to be a flop. Spiderverse should clean house in animation awards.,2023-06-02
"It will absolutely be a slap in the face if this movie doesn’t win best animation. The level of details and how everything made complete sense with their ideas for the emotions, scenery, etc. it was amazing.",2023-06-03
Elemental does not look good based on the trailer before Spiderverse.,2023-06-04
“Inside out” took the statue over “Anomalisa” so yah the academy sometimes doesn’t actually watch the best movie,2023-06-02
"Chin up, big guy. So, we ain't making Casablanca.",2023-06-03
Elemental did get a standing ovation at Cannes.  So we’ll see.  It does seem pretty Pixar formulaic.,2023-06-05
"When I saw the trailer for Elemental my reaction was *""oh, they've deliberately put something rather mediocre against Across the Spider Verse rather than something they're proud of, because they know they won't win either way""*",2023-06-03

Did you see puss in boots? I think that wins this year.,2023-06-02
I thought Suzume was better than Weathering With You but not near as great as Your Name.  Probably should get nominated but nowhere near the win.  I actually think it would have been a better mini-series,2023-06-05
Well Puss in Boots came out in 2022 so I don't think it'll be getting nominated,2023-06-04
there are more movies out there than just comic book movies,2023-06-02

"It would make sense, and actually address something kind of weird about the first movie.

In Into the Spider Verse, a big deal is made about Penny's robot being destroyed. It wasn't really set up beforehand, or explained afterwards, but there's a heavy emotional beat of Penny grieving the destroyed mech suit before leaving.

In Beyond the Spider Verse, she's the only one of the ""gag"" Spider-people who signed up with Miguel, and I think it's because of the trauma of losing the robot, her best friend. Spider Ham and Noir didn't experience that loss like that.

I think in Beyond the Spider Verse, she'll serve as a sort of ""point of view"" character for an average spider person struggling with the fallout of canon events and how Miguel's spider-society and theories appealed to her, and by extension to other spider people. There is comfort in knowing your suffering isn't pointless, it is necessary and unavoidable. 

Penny would be a great character to anchor this perspective in, as someone we know from the first movie and saw that point in her spider journey.",2023-06-09

"That's a good point, I think I didn't think about that because you see Gwen story basically conclude and then you see how miles is in the wrong Universe.

"> One of my favorite examples from the first movie is that when Miles and Peter are swinging away from the Alchemax facility, Peter is moving at 24fps (on 1s) and is smoother than Miles, who moves at 12fps (on 2s) to show his inexperience compared to Peter.

People often repeat this as a bit of trivia, but I don't think it's consistently true.

If you frame-advance through a copy of the movie, there is a lot of variation between shots (or even within shots) in how frequently the poses change. Often the position of the character on-screen shifts subtly every frame, but their limb positions only change every other frame. But it doesn't happen consistently enough to claim ""in the forest escape, Peter is more experienced so he's animated on ones while Miles is on twos"" or ""Miles appears on ones throughout the What's Up Danger sequence to show his new confidence"" (which is the other version I've seen). During the forest sequence, both characters get shots at both 12fps and 24fps.

It *is true* that Peter's poses are more confident, and that his and Miles's movements sync up more as the forest escape progresses to the ""thwip and release"" bit. But that's not quite the same thing as claiming that one character is on ones while the other is on twos.

Here's a video the co-director Peter Ramsey debunking it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhbSLEjTeD4#t=8m05s

>**And there was something on the animation. First you see certain characters animated at 12 fps, and progressively it's...**

> I've heard people say that - it's not really true.

> **Ah!**

> It's not really true, they're all animated at 12. 'Cause they're all on twos. There may be a few, for technical reasons, few small moments that we have to do on ones. But hardly ever.

> **There's no progression, then?**

> No. No, the only progression is in the performance of the characters. A lot of people have thought, ""oh Miles was animated on twos, and then he was animated on ones"" - no, he's on twos all the way. But it's just that as he gets more confident, his own performance becomes more confident.

> **Indeed. It's great to debunk something like that, because i've heard and read so many
things about the twelve...**

> Oh yeah, I know. Yeah, it's the myths.

*BUT HAVING SAID THAT...*

In [this Wired video at 8:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-wUKu_V2Lk#t=8m38s), one of the people who worked on the movie (I believe it's Josh Beveridge, Head of Character Animation) talks about the two characters coming into sync, and he offhandedly uses the phrase ""they're even on different framerates until they both get it together.""

"I felt it going off-the-rails for me abit in the whole HQ/Nueva York sequence. Which, to be fair, they’d written themselves into a corner — they probably did as well as they could’ve for having to explain canon/the multiverse AND introduce a Spider society AND do a massive Spider chase. 

That being said, though, that sequence was a LOT crammed in and was easily my least favorite part of the movie — on first watch, it had me feeling it’s a 4.5 instead of 5/5.

"True. And I wouldn't say cash grab - that's too strong. But Avengers felt different in that Infinity War felt like a complete movie with a proper climax. The final battle was included, they just lost.

The first movie was pure fan service tho. But I do kinda agree with OP. This movie was good but left me feeling a bit disappointed.,2023-06-07
Tom Holland’s Spider-Man may saved some canon events but eventually it caught up with him with May,2023-06-04
"!!! yeah, I think what they're really doing with the multiverse canon event schtick is exploring the question of how do you write an original story for AU characters who by design operate in the shadow of the original. Miles is his own version of Spider-Man, but ultimately he's also *a* Spider-Man and that's a character with decades worth of history and tropes and the narrative expectations that come with it. The main obstacle in this movie is that very character history which I felt was visualized in the form of the entire Neuva York chase scene as he evades all the hundres of AU spider-people trailing after him to copy the outlines of their stories onto his. The spider-people helped him actualize his potential as Spider-Man the mantle in ITSV, but in ATSV the spider-people are very much holding him back from actualizing his selfhood.",2023-06-06

"Right, spot is going back to (I forget his actual earth #) to kill his dad, but really his dad in original isn’t even relevant to canon bc miles isn’t supposed to be Peter. 

This also probably means there’s two spider men in miles’ original home because 42 and (1892?) are in 1892

Which also means why did the captain have to die in earth 42 when there was no Peter. Wouldn’t that earth be an entire anomaly considering it’s just no Spidey",2023-06-03

"I have to assume they have a plan for the third beyond just “rescue Miles and then have the final battle against the Spot, but stretch it out into 2+ hours”, because otherwise, yeah, why not just change some stuff around, have the storyline conclude in this movie, and then do a third one with a different plot? It would be disappointing if Beyond the Spider-Verse indeed just feels like the third act of this one, which is why I assume there will be more to it.",2023-06-05

"Nah, it was bloated as hell.

They turned two acts into 2 hours. There is a lot of fat to be trimmed off of here.

"Nah a movie SHOULD BE a complete story in and of itself. Even if it's part 1 of 2, it should be able to stand alone and feel enjoyable and satisfying to watch. Infinity war was a part 1 but it's better in that sense because it still stands well as it's own story. You don't feel like you've been cheated. Yes, we knew the story wasn't fully over but it reached a satisfying conclusion in infinity war with the snap actually taking place.

But this movie made many people feel like they were cheated because they just didn't handle this aspect well. You can have cliffhangers and still make something a complete story. They're not mutually exclusive. The issue isn't even the cliffhanger, it's just that this movie has no resolution and the fact that it has a very messy structure (with no beginning, middle, or end) just makes it even worse. I loved it but this movie has it's issues.",2023-06-29

"It’s when Miles is running from Miguel and co in the spider-city. Miles lands on a flying car which is shown to be a Hyundai. You also see a billboard in the background a few seconds later.

That coupled with the actual Hyundai ad featuring Miles/Gwen that played before the trailers, made it pretty obvious and annoying. 

Like the Sony Headphones and PS5 are borderline acceptable to me because it’s just a Sony thing, but Hyundai is a whole other brand, and the rest of the movie has jabs at capitalism and product placements (like there’s literally fake brands on billboards all across NY, but then 1 real billboard thrown in)",2023-06-18
"Idk I just really enjoy the more grounded stuff but I totally agree with character reintroductions Everytime someone is introduced they gave to do the ""Let's go over this again"" and it feels so pointless.

Movie didn't feel like a movie tbh just a long tv episode. They shaft Spot & miles family issues for him to meet the others.

"Well yeah of course it didn't conclude the arc, it's the second movie of a trilogy...",2023-06-25
"I think that all stems from it being too decompressed to fit 2 movies. If they tightened it up and only kept the best things it'd probably make a better movie.

"I mean, from a teenagers perspective... Having been one and parenting 2 atm... Parents are somewhat obstacles to them.  We try not to be but very much end up being just that sometimes.

Infinity war had the mind to pace the film and give multiple conclusions to characters albeit sad. It turns it into a sunset ending for the villain.

That is some anti consumer bs.",2023-06-11
Maybe they should've ended it with the reveal of prowler miles instead of the spider team assemble,2023-06-11
"The complete arc is clearly supposed to be him realising his strength and determination in who he is. As well as Gwen coming to understand that she needs to fight for her friends/family and trust her friends/family.

Gwen's arc is great, no complaints.

Miles' arc... I just don't think was set up right. To me, it never felt like he didn't have confidence in who he was nor did it feel like he was going to let people push him around. Miles' mum gives him a big speech about not letting people push him out or take away from who he is, and he doesn't really seem to struggle with any of that internally.

The initial setup for his character arc appears to be 1. That he struggles to balance being spiderman, being a student, and being a son. None of that gets addressed. and 2. His loneliness, lack of friends, and obsession/insecurities/betrayal of his spider-friends. That also isn't addressed, in fact it's pretty much left at the lowest point at the end of the movie.",2023-06-12

I mean i didnt see that said in trailer or on movie poster sooo im pretty annoyed,2023-06-07
It wasn’t. I found out that it was announced as part one and two weeks ay back when they were announce and then no marketing material showed that. I’ve wanted to see this movie since I saw the first one in the movie theater. And I missed that. So the general movie audience will be even more confused,2023-06-07
"Well, yes ultimately but there's more shades to him than was expected.",2023-06-05

"I mean, I get your point. I’m also not saying the twist doesn’t work at all. I’m saying it doesn’t work IF you catch on to what universe they’re in, and the film explicitly, at multiple points, draws your attention to this. Yes, it’s easily missed, but it’s more than a subtle hint. Taking it out would’ve meant it would be far harder to realize what was happening, while still making it feel just as deserved in the overall story.",2023-06-02
They did at the beginning of this one. I don’t think they did in the first film.,2023-06-03
"Right?? Even if you didn’t see the “Earth 42” and realized what that meant, the universe he goes to is obviously wrong as soon as you see it. And not just because it’s nighttime and raining, I mean the vibe is just off immediately. And when he goes to see his mom, everything about their apartment is totally wrong.",2023-08-08
"I feel like the sequel had a number of those slowed down scenes. The scene with Miles and his mom talking. The scene with Miles and Gwen hanging upside down overlooking the city. The scene with Gwen hugging it out with her dad and opening up to him with her big speech. The scene similar to this exact one where Miles is eavesdropping on Gwen as she's snooping around trying to find Spot and then the bad guys come in. 

I'm sure there were plenty more these are just off the cuff. Both movies were incredible and the second one was definitely more fast paced, but contained plenty of impactful moments too.",2023-06-07
"Exactly, which is one of the reasons why the pacing / structure of the movie is completely off.

The first half of the movie sets up the spot as being the main villain. But suddenly everyone forgets about him as the latter half of the movie sets up Miguel as being the co-villain (?). Neither Miguel nor the spot is dealt with in the slightest. This, in my opinion, resulted in an extremely weird pacing of the film. It felt more like watching 10 short films about Spiderman and Gwen than watching one coherent movie. 

And that's not even mentioning the countless other plot points that are also unresolved. It felt like the movie was trying to encapsulate this huge intricate plot, but unfortunately didn't pay enough attention to the details, which led to me not really being emotionally invested in any of the unfortunately kind of superficial plot points. The first movie had an extremely interesting and concise plot, which made it much enjoyable to me.

To me, the sequel was trying to fit way too many plot points into one film, which resulted in the plot not really going anywhere. I am really surprised at how much people in this thread seem to have enjoyed the film. The people I watched it with were quite dissapointed.

(Also, as as sidenote, it felt like there were way more cringy Marvel-quips in the sequel than in the first movie. The first movie was hilarious without being over the top. After watching 30 minutes of the sequel, however, I was already tired of the constant cringy attempts at one-liners.)",2023-06-10
Also given the size of Gwen's squad I'd imagine that there's going to be a big cast of villains running wild in that universe that they'd eventually have to fight through.,2023-06-02
"No, because infinity war at least finished as a movie.The difference between the two is the plot and structure. A part of the problem are the amount of actions that dosent get consequences. For example we get to see how Miles is willing to tell his identity. He makes that choice, but we don't get to see the consequences of those choices in the plot, because of it not being his universe. Even though what I mentioned May be a problem, the real crime is the structure. The tension gets up, through all the movie, and after it reaches a certain point, it starts to go down, but then suddenly it starts going up again in a speed like never before, just to stop abruptly. Do you know what would been a good, or at least a better ending? If the movie ended when it is revealed that Miles is in another universe, because the story would end in a low point of tension, but with a plot twist. That's how you make a good cliffhanger. Make a plot twist when the tension is low. That's the key. But instead they took a lot of bad decisions that ended up giving an unsatisfying end.

But the story- and the way they decided to tell that it, made this film overal a letdown. The 1st had a well-told and tightly paced story, and the 2nd movie lacks that, which brings it down considerably IMO.

It's still a good movie, but nowhere near as good as the first one.",2023-06-08

"This is kind of true. I wouldn't say free will is the prominent theme but a consequence of the primary issue between realism vs nominalism. 

The spider alliance (idk what else to call them) are echoing the arguments of the philosopher's God when they say the spiderman essence and actions (canon events) are the same. In other words, in order to be spiderman it's not enough to have spider dna and spider powers, you must also necessarily do things. Being and doing are the same.

Miles then rejects this invisible world of forms and says ""I'm Miles Morales,"" instead of ""I am Spiderman,"" rejecting the essence entirely for his own individuality, even though he wouldn't be himself without the spider in the first place.

This is also the same debate going on in gender ideology and people like Matt Walsh. Kind of. Walsh cuts off the doing and only leaves the being part (woman DNA), whereas the trans people reject he essence and say ""I can do whatever I want."" Problem is, you can't see any identity or perceive any distinction without doing. They are both wrong. You need being and doing. There has to be movement towards something with powers and actions for something to be intelligible. This is what Aristotle called *energeia.*

So for the same reasons the trans people will believe Miles is their guy and see the movie as an allegory for their ideology, realists will see this as another instance of propaganda. As a realist, I can still acknowledge this move was a well crafted, not preachy, very subtle and clever example of satanism: the serpent rejecting God.",2023-06-25

But if he did still want to kill Miles, it makes sense. Why should they believe his story? It could be a trick. Even if it's true, good Miles knows Evil Miles is a supervillain.

"How do you know that? From what we're shown each Spider-Man (or Woman) experiences ONE canon event. Peter B. lost his Uncle Ben. Gwen lost her Peter. Miguel took the place of a dead counterpart, thereby dooming that world and causing his own canon event. Maybe because Miles is an anomaly and he has to experience TWO canon events? Or maybe that's the consequence of disrupting a canon event. I don't know. 

None of this took away from my sheer enjoyment of the film (which I've now seen twice). It's a question that came up for me.

"It's only a partial resolution, Miles' turmoil isn't fully resolved, he's still in a state of panic and isn't able to resolve that tension between himself and his parents. Also, a good character arc should have an internal and external resolution, and that external resolution doesn't exist because he doesn't get a chance to spot The Spot and save his father. Infinity War has an external resolution because the final battle of that film is what it's been building to the whole time, Thanos vs the Avengers, and Thanos wins.",2023-06-05

"I think the canon events are:

 - Bitten by a mutated spider 

- The death of a loved one as a direct result of an action taken or a choice made by the Spider-Person

- The death of their first love interest (Conditional based on said love interest existing. Ex: Gwen doesn't have a love interest in her reality so there's no opportunity for this death to occur)

- The loss of a police captain close to the Spider-Person

In the case of Miles, he's only completed the ""bitten..."" and the ""death of a loved one..."" canon events. The death of a police captain is the last one remaining, and it's just bad luck that the police captain close to him happens to be his dad.",2023-06-04
">Yeah also what determines a canon event exactly?


Perhaps plausibility.  For example, Miles' parents plan to never leave New York.  Common sense says that means, 'except on vacation'.  But maybe they'll never get on a plane, ever.  So, they can't die in a plane crash they were never in.

Or, perhaps Miguel is only saying that because he's a mouthpiece for the writers wish that Miles gets accepted, and doesn't actually have to make sense.  And it's just a plot hole.",2023-06-04

"Gwen's dad fate 'changed' b/c Gwen's dad isn't the equivalent of Uncle Ben in Gwen's universe. For Gwen it was prolly her version of Peter Parker when he changed into their universe's version of the lizard guy. So Gwen's Dad didn't have a canon event because he isn't a canon event character. 

Just like how the Mumbattan Universe had a canon event that was supposed to be the death of Captain Singh. The Dad of a girl Spiderman liked and not even Spiderman's dad/family himself. 

Also, ya Miles' is the cause of all the troubles in the multiverse. The movie even states that everything that happens because of characters crossing between universes when they're not supposed to, and thus subsequently risking the destruction of entire universes is because of Miles actually. 

If Earth-42 spider had just did what it should've done and bitten Earth-42 Peter Parker and turned that Peter Parker into Spiderman then not only would Miles be avoiding this situation, but so would everybody else. 

So even by your own admission Miles is actually an even bigger villain than **everyone** else combined together in the story. Albeit an inadvertent one.

Him being the original anomaly started the rest of the anomalies and destroyed everyone else's universes, and if it weren't for Miguel and the other Spider-heroe's stopping cross-universe events then even more unierses would've died out already. 

I mean you defend Miles' actions here so badly, but look at the cause and effect chain here. 

Spot is going to kill Miles' dad is the effect, but the cause of that is b/c he was Donuted by Miles. Yet the cause of that is b/c Miles' became spiderman, and the cause of that is b/c of a cross-universe mistake where a canon-event got disrupted and made Miles Morales into Spi8derman when he should've just been an ordinary person. 

So even your own logic defeats you.",2023-06-07
"The trolley problem is a mathematical equation, so it breaks down as you reach infinity. If there are an infinite amount of people in both track one and track two, then switching the track ceases to become a meaningfully distinct choice, as both outcomes are identical.

"The movie set Miguel up to be quite the asshole actually.

Even his very first appearance he seemed like a good fighter, but was otherwise either an asshole or at least just sorta unfriendly not not personable...at best. He certainly did not come off as likeable or main character/heroic vibes, and if anyone got that impression at all then that impression was **immediately and jarringly shattered** the next time he showed up onscreen when he went into full-blown psycho mode. 

They didn't even let him explain the logic of it all very accurately. 

Imagine a real life incident where an active shooter holds a school hostage and says either this teacher jumps off the building and then I'll kill myself and end this whole crisis or I'll just massacre this entire school of kindengaden children. Imagine that teacher runs away and then the shooter laughs maniacally while slaughtering children. All of this is caught on live stream in every social media platform, immortalized eternally on the internet. 

The death toll is like 20 kids. 

Imagine how utterly hated by **everyone in the entire fucking world this teacher would be**.

And that would be over like 20 kids.

"Again, the movie did a bad job of showing the full story b/c they obviously wanted you and the audience to side with miles, but the answer is ""b/c that scene was like only 60 seconds of exposition and the full story of Miguel's universe collapse involved much more than what could've been explained in 60 seconds of talking"". 

Miguel replaced alternate universe Miguel and caused a canon event disruption, and thus began his **habit** of continuously disrupting the normal flow and what's supposed to happen in that universe. That's why even Miles reazlied that they brought in peter to bring him down softly. 

B/c they knew that this very first step into the multi-verse they needed to establish a habit of him enduring the pain of sacrifice. It sucks and honestly nobody really likes it, but he knows that if he lets Miles have this one then Miles will do what Miguel did. Continuously disrupt canon-events and break his universe until his universe does, indeed, break. 

You even saw it in the Indian spiderman universe. He goes after Captain Singh b/c that's just his nature. He has a habit of disrupting canon-events. The same habit MIguel had. 

Thank god Miguel learned from his mistakes.",2023-06-07
"\>Then they should tell the guy whose life is on the line to at least give him a chance to make an informed decision to self-sacrifice. 

There'd be some hilarious lolz cuz Miles' dad would likely choose to sacrifice himself if he knew what the Spider-heroes knew. 

And no Miles definitely isn't trying to save the universe. He literally just wants to save his dad, and he even tries to use some nice mind games with Uncle Ben on peter parker to do. 

Also, if you want to go the route of ""infinite people dying""...then by your logic letting the entire multiverse die is actually perfectly OK b/c infinity is infinity. Ya it's a baddddddd road to go down if you want to go down the infinite concept thing. 

Miguel is right b/c you literally saw the results of what happened when he didn't do what he should've done. What he is currently doing, and what he is currently trying to do with Miles.",2023-06-07
"\>The more unhinged that Miguel the comes, the more you should realise to not be taking his word at face value. 

That's actually my problem with the movie too. 

They make him a complete asshole even at his first showing, and then he can't even talk like a normal person and just screams and rants. 

They portray him as this evil and mentally unstable person when they could've just as easily shown him to be logical and well-balanced b/c they had to do the whole muh what is 1 life worth thing.

\>It's not one person. It's a lot of people. Miguel has established a society which excepts that some people must die in order for the universe to be right. 

Miguel established nothing. 

For some reason, everybody here just cannot seem to accept that what if it really is true that there just is no way to avoid that part about:

\>some people must die in order for the universe to be right. 

B/c the movie even makes it obvious that some events **NEED** to happen...including ones where people die. In other words, some people **NEED** to die. 

Hollywood and the entertainment industry really need to stop coddling everybody and making everything all happy-cheery lovey-dovey and write stories about how there's always a ""nothing bad needs to happen and everything can be good"" ending. This is the definition of toxic positivity and it needs to go away.",2023-06-07

It's the exact opposite of that. >!Miguel and co. aren't trying to save everybody, they're explicitly sacrificing a few people in order to save the many, a ""greater good"". That's not saving everyone. Miles, on the other hand, *is* trying to save everyone: he's going to save his Dad, and then try to find a solution to the collapse problem. *That's* saving everyone, and it's what ""Spider-Man"", as a collective ideal, should be doing. I don't really have a problem with Miguel being OK with it, as he's always been morally ambiguous (it's what makes him so interesting and so refreshing compared to other Spider-Men), but characters like Peter, Gwen, and the rest? No way. And as I said, if the canon issue gets resolved, then all these characters are now murder accessories.

I loved the film but that’s my main complaint. It was missing a 3rd act. Just hard to see it as a complete movie. Plus the ending kept dragging.

"The first movie is a part of the trilogy and stands on its own, while since this is a part 1, it just doesn't. I am just personally not of a fan of that, feel other mediums would be better suited for this style of story. To be honest, because this a part 1, It felt the pace slowed down so badly due to the runtime without really adding or using it time to make it not ""empty."" What doesn't feel empty to me is everything that came out of the first movie. I just saw lots of opportunities to cut it down or to add more focus. Overall, it's a great film, just really meh at a lot of parts. I'm not sure I'm super convinced it needed to be two parts. Ie I didn't get much more emotional connection that I wouldn't have gotten from just anything because of the first movie. I actually feel like some character motivations were really shortcutted or just very empty (outside of main trio and ohare). Just a personal opinion. Again, I expect to be in the minority. But who knows. I am a huge fan but not a fan of the small creative choices outside that I'm just a big fan of the Spiderman series so I like the references and being an art perspn.

Could be Miles, or a Peter Parker of Earth-42. I'd be willing to bet Peter in Earth-42 is who saves Miles, but with no Spider powers (could be Goblin like as he could still be smart in this world).

Miles's dad love him. Holy jeez, we know. Like it was all heartfelt and beautiful and I'm sure lots of people appreciated it. But I had that same feeling. From the portal onward was pretty much great.",2023-06-05
Very nice.,2023-06-05
The beginning of the movie when Spot is saying he got the spider from an alternate universe you can see the spider is on its way to bite 42 Miles. 42 Miles was supposed to be spiderman and fight against all those villains and our 1610 Miles likely would have taken over as Prowler after his dad died.,2023-06-05
">Miles isnt part of the Canon, so the rules don't apply to him.

You believe that fact, then u can surely believe saving Mile's dad can destroy the spiderverse. You can't negate Miguel's whole theory. 

Let say Miles disproves the theory and saves both, therefore his canon since nothing changed.

Else say Miguel's right(thus far he has been right), therefore Mile's spiderman should'nt exist and only Blonde Peter should exist. Basically only one spiderman for each dimension.

But heres the catch, E1610 comic is the real canon of the story in which where the spider 42 was from. In my theory, since the spider leaked to the past, Miles became spiderman way too early and caused a E1610a(evil miles) and E1610b. Basically the multiverse is already rewritten and still writing at this point with Miles being the accident sole purpose of it.  The Saving or sacrificing don't matter at this stage cuz the Multiverse will eventually collapse earlier or latter to E616.",2023-06-06

The soundtrack and the score is admittedly pretty good. Like Avatar it's definitely a movie to watch at a cinema rather than at home.


But story wise it's nothing special. Even taking into regard other sci-fi movie stories it's not a patch on interstellar or inception. It's kinda basic sci-fi story. The twist at the end was interesting but other than that it was pretty simple. 

I too wonder for those that say this is the best movie ever lol",2023-09-10
Gwen's story had a full arc and she is what started the movie. I would much rather a 2.5 hour climax than a 20 minute one. It's like saying they should have just made Empire Strikes Back 20 minutes longer because Last Jedi was just a cash grab.,2023-06-25
"It ends at a point where the story within itself is over. There’s obviously more things to to come, and it would have been it’s own disappointment if there was no ROTJ from a fan perspective, but imagine if ended where Luke is cornered by Vader, right before he drops the reveal.

That’s not an ending to where it can function as it’s own story within the overarching plot of the trilogy. Across and Beyond are tied as one to me now because the ending was too abrupt for it to function within itself. I get that it was intended as a Part 1/Part 2, but personally I still think you can leave enough closure between each for them to stand as 2 separate films.


Even Kill Bill wrapped up enough in part 1 for it to feel like a settled ending before the adventure continues again.",2023-06-04
"I understand that, but that wasn't because of a deviant spiderman doing something they weren't supposed to - it was simply the natural order of things in that universe.

"I think that's fair, but I'm approaching this from the way Miguel's character, and the movie, frames the situation.  As it stands, Miles saving his father necessitates the destruction of his universe at the very least and vice versa.  While it's more than completely understandable and even ""good"" for Miles to save his father, Miles as far as he and all the characters are concerned, is knowingly risking the safety/existence of his universe and its people to save his father, that is selfish (understandably so).  This moral dilemma isn't only worth exploring on its own terms, but it's a meaningful one to explore to the backdrop of ""What makes Spider-Man who he is?"".  Using some plot point that gives Miles an out of this situation really diminishes this experience he's in.",2023-06-02

It doesn't have a spider man because that radioactive spider got sent to Miles' universe.  I'm thinking Miguel is who that spider was supposed to bite in 42.  That he never got bit and doesn't have spider powers naturally since he uses that shot for strength and speed and uses claws to climb.

He left that universe to go to one that he could be with his kid.  So that's why 42 verse doesn't have a spider man.  Miguel never got bit and then he left.",2023-06-04

The idea of “canon” is also definitely commentary on how Spider-Man has been forced to fit into this idea, which basically comes down to ticking boxes. “Bit by a spider, mentor dies, aunt may, etc”. 

The canon is pretty inherently flawed when you look at it. Plenty of Spider-Men there have yet to go through certain events, and they’re doing okay. Gwen’s dad quit as chief, and she’s still a spider hero. Also, blaming Miles for getting bit by that spider is way off base. The spider went through the super collider, no matter what, 42 lost their shot at having a Spider-Man. 

Miguel’s primary character trait is his arrogance, so it seems pretty likely for him to become unhinged when he has hundreds of Spider-Men chasing Miles, fail to catch him, and Miles is doing what he perceives as destroying the multiverse.

Yes I agree with you on her caring about Miles I never said she didn't. What I said was that she only considers how she feels at the expense of other characters and everything besides her self

Gwen is not like that with Hobie? Are you sure? It looked like as you say two characters who have a ton of things in common and are also attracted to each, which might lead to occasional bonks here and then (especially if they work together) and a possible ""that was a mistake"" and guilt followed by another night of bonking once in a while

Last thing I would say is her wearing those shoes is gross for me personally. Imagine caring about someone so deeply that you keep your head shaved where they accidentally cut your hair and then keeping the shoes of the guy you occasionally bonk at the same time.

That was painful,2023-06-03
"And I think it's gonna be revealed that not all of those Spider-Men were completely in it.  They're chasing down a kid, and Miguel is obviously trying to hurt him.  There's gonna be that doubt in the back of some of their heads, that they're doing all this to stop a kid.",2023-06-03

"Ahhh okay, that makes sense. Thank you 😇🩵",2023-06-04
I feel like whoever that Spider bit has to go through all the things that all the Spider-Mans go through. He’s his universe’s Miles Morales but he’s Universe 42’s Spider-Man. He still has to go through the rite of passage of all the Spider-Man,2023-06-04

"I just watched the first one again, and miles gets bit like the day before the collider kills Spider-Man.  So realistically, earth 42 spider transported, bit miles, and died regardless of miles interaction and would still leave earth 42 Spider-Man-less.  Him getting his Spider-Man killed I can roll with, but I’m missing the connection between miles getting bit being his fault.",2023-06-12
"Sorry, yes, that's not my question. That part totally makes sense! I just didn't catch Miguel's response at all. What does Miguel say *in response to* Miles after Miles calls him Tio??

That's the part I missed! Thanks in advance!",2023-06-12
"On #1 ahha gotcha, thank you!

On #2 this makes sense, but the only reason he has that meta knowledge is because they told him, right?

Thanks for filling in my knowledge gaps, this helped a lot",2023-06-12

"I would honestly say that I really like Across the Spider Verse a lot more than Into the Spider Verse, even though they left the audience on a cliff hanger, which i felt rip-offed because I used my hard earn money. 

however, i would like to see a more updated version of peter parker but with the same production value as the Spider Verse's trilogy or even a whole movie about the other universes' Spider-Man and not just a snippet of a few and their backstories.",2023-08-24
"Hmm I understand that's not what happened in the film itself. But I guess it's a reasonable extrapolation of what Gwen might have done in her months with the Spider Society, based on what \*did happen in the movie (i.e. Gwen trying to stop Miles from disrupting a canon event).

I don't think that's true. Gwen said that the wristband helped her not glitch when she was in other dimensions and Jessica threw one to Miles to help him not glitch when he was at headquarters.

yeah but the funny part is i kind of forgot?? like i was like why are they showing this tense scene with miguel miles is clearly in another dimension. but when the conversation with the mom happened i am just like oh hes back home i guess,2023-06-02
"I appreciated that it kind of worked both ways. I noticed the 42, so I was waiting for it the whole time. I think the feeling of dread you get when you watch Miles fighting to make it while knowing he’s so so far from home is very effective. I think that if you hadn’t noticed or if you forgot about universe 42, you get to feel the shock along with Miles which works really well too.

Maybe this is far fetched but I feel like it recreates the parent/child perspectives that they were emphasizing the whole movie. The parent watches the child do something they know will go poorly despite good intentions with dread but acknowledges the child’s lack of knowledge/wisdom. The child experiences the event for the first time and feels the shock in its entirety.",2023-06-03
"I went ""isn't 42 the dimension his spider is from? Oh shit"" And then when it kept going I started double guessing myself if maybe I'd gotten misremembered which number was his and which the spider's. I thought it worked really well with the is it/isn't it!",2023-06-04
"Honestly I think most people just missed the split second of the machine saying universe 42, like I did. There’s just SO much going on at times (in a good way) that I’m trying to take in 15 different things at once in this beautifully animated film that I just glossed over it saying that because I was focused on something else in the scene in that brief moment. There were a lot of moments that I caught and my friend didn’t catch and vice versa. So for you, you saw it the whole time but for me, I didn’t see the signpost and so it was a rug pull. 

Brilliant film, but I definitely was sensory overloaded at times too haha. Can’t wait to watch again.",2023-06-04
"There was just a lot going on to keep up so a lot of ppl including myself definitely saw that he's being sent back to Earth 42 but didn't register that's not his universe. 

And even if you picked up on that, it still has another surprise for everyone which is who is Prowler in that universe.",2023-06-04
"By that point I had long forgotten what number miles’ universe was supposed to be, so the twist was a big surprise, especially since the interspersed shots of Gwen made it seem like she was listening to him, instead of outside a different empty bedroom.",2023-06-04

Wow great spot! Wish i had rewatched the first one before seeing this,2023-06-03
The “it’s a Banksy” after they successfully stop the helicopter had my whole theater laughing out loud as well. That entire sequence was amazingly done,2023-06-04
Pretty sure it wasn’t an adlib since it’s a line from the first movie,2023-06-03
Its actually the exact same soundbite from the first movie during the banksy joke,2023-06-03
Glad I’m not the only one noticed that,2023-06-09
yes! My thoughts exactly!,2023-06-16
Peter B is supposed to be ‘default’ Spider-Man so it makes sense,2023-06-03
"I saw it more as he got away because he doesn’t think like a Spider Man per se. They do keep commenting “what is he doing? Where is he going?” so what I got from that is that because he’s NOT a Spider-Man he is unpredictable to them and escapes their clutches. 

There’s something to be said about the recurring theme in the film of identity and labelling theory. The thing that is no doubt holding the Spider Society back is that they’ve almost resigned themselves to be Spider People down to their pre conceived lore and despite their costumes and their gadgets, are not allowing themselves to break out from what they’re “meant” to be.",2023-06-02
He’s the ~~Rickest Rick~~ Spider-est Spider-Man.,2023-06-03
"Conservation of Spider-jutsu. In universe, I don't think he is meant to be the strongest, but its just that most Spiderman powers are more adept to getting away than catching people and the spider-guys are not trying to hurt him too bad overall and maybe also dont have their hearts into attacking the kid.",2023-06-07
Is he even Spider-Man!?,2023-06-04
"Eloquently put! I’ve been trying to put it into words since it really rings wrong to me when people express that Miguel is a villain when he’s really just trying desperately to be the hero since the last time he failed to do so, countless lives (including those of his alt family) were wiped away.",2023-06-04
You put this beautifully!,2023-06-03
"The idea that he could have saved his alternate family and just failed to do so is probably also so painful to imagine that he just rejects the notion outright. If canon events can be ignored, then they died unnecessarily",2023-06-03
It’s KINDA like High Evolutionary from GotG3. So set in his ways until an outside force shifts the paradigm not in his favor.,2023-06-02
I mean he literally says he's sacrificed too much to stop now,2023-06-04
"I’m super late to the game, but I don’t think his dad is fated to die. In 42 the dad dies despite there being no Spider-Man. Our Miles was never meant to be Spider-Man, so there’s no reason for his dad to die. The problem is now that Miles got involved Spot and probably 42 Miles want his dad dead. So it’s not a matter of faith, but the consequences of his actions. At least that’s my read on it.",2023-11-21
Miguel may have made some sort of other huge mistake... Or just isn't 100p sure what canon means and might just be projecting his traumas on others.,2023-06-04
"I mean, how is the actual radioactive spider disappearing from the universe not a canon-breaking event? Shouldn’t earth 42 have already collapsed?",2023-06-12
"Especially since Gwen’s canon event was her friend dying, and not the police captain or her uncle like the others. She was breaking canon way before.",2023-06-04
"I guess Miguel selected for those that would agree with his mission. 

And also those who had already had their canon events, and so would find the idea that their suffering was ""necessary"" and ""destined"" to be comforting. 

It's kind of a self-fulfilling maladaptive trauma response. I hope we get to see more of the other spider-people's perspective as Gwen flips more of them in Beyond the Spider Verse. We can already see she flipped a couple (Penny, Spiderbyte, Peter)",2023-06-09
I mean it’s complicated. You kind of need somebody so dedicated to their mission that they’re an “unhinged maniac” if you’re running a organization with the literal fate of the universe on its hands. And it’s not like he isn’t right…,2023-06-12
Wait is 2099 the year or the universe number?,2023-06-07
"My personal theory is that because Miles is not ""supposed to be"" Spiderman (i.e. he was bit by a spider from another universe) he's already not bound by the laws of ""canon"" anyway",2023-06-05
How does this relate to Kang?,2023-06-04
you didnt respond at what he asked which is miguel ohara origin story. guess you arent a comic book reader,2023-06-04
"Well no, Spider-man 2099 is saying ""There are fixed points in a Spider-man's life where someone dies, they don't happen the universe dies""

That's not killing anyone, that's not interfering with natural law to prevent a catastrophy. 

Thanos was just a madman,  if you kill half of all life on earth, you just say things back a generation or so. You're not really saving anyone. Of course, in reality, since he's killing all flora and fauna, he's actually collapsing the ecosystem of planets triggering an extinction event.  Since you eat plants and animals, if he dusted half of those then you'd still have the same shortage.",2023-06-14
"Yeah, man.  Didn’t know that.  I guess I’ll go fuck myself.  Fuck me tor trying to have a fun thought",2023-06-04
"Eeh too many clues in this movie that he isn't.

First Parker says ""you're the only Spiderman not funny""

Then Miles says ""you have claws?? Are you sure you're a spider man?""

He might not be",2023-08-08
"He's clearly Morbius.

Or I need to rewatch the movie, because I vaguely recall noticing an icon on the Prowler's suit having a shape reminiscent of what Miguel had on the back of his suit.",2023-06-05
That was exactly my thought,2023-06-05
"Miles’ problem isn’t that he tried to save the other Spider-Man’s parents. The problem is that he succeeded. Miguel understands how the multiverse works and paid a steep price for making a similar mistake. He believes Miles will kill off his entire universe if he saves his dad. 

Regardless of what Spider-Man stands for, he’s never been capable of saving everybody. Including his loved ones. Miguel understands the big picture. It doesn’t make him a villain or evil and I think the movie missed the mark by not addressing the situation with the nuance it deserved.",2023-06-04
"That’s fair. From his perspective Miles is risking billions of lives to save one, I think the fact that they’re all super powered beings kinda lessens the impact of him fighting a kid. Plus Miles was fine. But I see where you’re coming from",2023-06-04
I was guessing Miguel has a paralysing venom bite and that the was trying to put Renaissance Vulture down.,2023-06-04

"Same, I thought they would end with Miles and Gwen alone after the dad speech. But it still had plenty of things to show.",2023-06-02
Same. I knew something was up with the pacing. 2 hours in and we weren’t even close to the end of the 2nd act. I guess the next movie will be the whole 3rd act or maybe the 3rd act will be the prologue like Gwen’s this time.,2023-06-03

"Can I just say though how much I love that they gave all of those moments the room they needed to breathe?

I wouldn’t have wasted money to see it in theaters so I guess that’s true.,2023-06-05
It was for when it was supposed to come out this time last year then they changed the names of this and part 2 so if you hadn't remembered ad campaigns that started 2 years ago you'd be none the wiser.,2023-06-07
"Right, it's hard to imagine since everything relies on carrying the thread into the next film. 

I compared it to Infinity War & and Endgame. Part 1 & 2, both connected, but they each feel like complete films. Endgame continues the story, but infinity war had a clear beginning, middle, and end.

The thing that irked me here is that you had a 10/10 movie that stops right as things get interesting, leaving me feeling empty watching it. I'm not a fan of cliffhangers, as I think they're lazy unless done at a GREAT twist that wraps up the previous plot threads while unraveling another. 

I think the best thing would've been to give it another 15-20 mins, have the spider teams fight, spot re-emerges. Cut to miles in captivity with prowler miles, and cut back to spot reaching full form, tearing the multiverse open into darkness. End it there.",2023-06-02

"it really really needed a scene where Miles and Miguel just interacted for a while alone. or Gwen could come too. maybe they couldve gone to some universe looking for clues idk

as it is now, Miles meets Miguel, he tells him about the multiverse, immediately tries to kill him. there should have been something in between. maybe they couldve cut the last 15 mins of the movie to make space",2023-06-03
"Right. Every time I talked about the movie with people, they say it's different because IW wasn't a part 1, but it serves as a part 1 to a whole story, including endgame. 

I felt miffed leaving the theatre, but this was a much better film than into the spiderverse, and if they nail the 3rd, we'll have the greatest trilogy in film imo",2023-06-20
That wasn’t me but… he was me.,2023-06-05
Easily missable for me. I wouldn’t have wasted money seeing this in the theater if I knew the movie was going to finish with “insert more credits to continue.” I paid for one full  movie.

"Lots of people just like going to the movies, even if its something they're only mildly interested in and at release. And its me.

"I would count myself among those. I saw the first one, loved it enough that I knew I’d see the sequel whenever it came out without following any of the marketing or build-up to it, and found myself free on the Thursday evening it premiered. In the moment, I never felt that a movie totally lost me in the final seconds before. After sleeping on it, and learning that it was supposed to be part 1 and the studio changed the title(s), I was more okay with it. But, still, hard cut to black after introducing even more conflict in the final minutes of a movie with no real resolution to any of the major plot threads is asking a LOT of an audience. To the point that I will avoid seeing Beyond until reviews come out and I am assured that they did stick the landing.",2023-06-02

But I doubt that fight is going to be as pivotal as people think.",2023-06-03
Only miles went to Earth-42,2023-06-11
"That's not exactly how that works. Frame rates and refresh rates (sometimes hz, sometimes called other stuff) are two separate things. E.g. you can have a TV refreshing 60 times per second showing a 30 FPS film - it just means the image on the TV changes every other refresh, so compared to a 60hz showing 60FPS it will look a little stiffer.

So the movie was being projected (or however you watched it) at a steady, probably 60hz. To have different characters at different fps just means their own animations were updated less often - this was done in the first Spiver-Verse, when Peter B. and Miles are running away together I believe Miles is in a lower fps - that is, he has fewer frames of animation, or he has fewer frames where he's moving, so he looks stiff compared to Peter B.

A screen absolutely can't refresh at different rates simultaneously, but what you want is a screen refreshing at a very very stable rate and then you have the actual media doing whatever it is designed to do under that. You can technically have a 120FPS even on a 60hz screen but you don't get to see the difference since you only get up to 60 screen refreshes per second no matter what.",2023-06-04
"1st one I thought of. Spiderverse, coco and the new puss are the 3 movies to me that has the best animation.

"Personally I was sold on Miguel’s backstory.  He destroyed an entire universe and literally all that he loved because he wanted a happy life, that would send almost everyone on the warpath.  Plus that example shows the other spiders *exactly* what happens when things go wrong, and from Mumbattan it seems his assumptions aren’t wrong.

Yeah Miguel was that vampire-like in the comics too.  He has permanent completely red eyes(so he wears sunglasses to hide them), non-retractable fangs with paralyzing venom(so he tries to hide his mouth when talking), and the retractable talons/claws that he uses to climb and slash(he accidentally slashed someone’s throat when he found out about this).  The movie version though seems to be able to retract his fangs and his eyes aren’t completely red(and it seems he can control when his pupils turn red)

Morlun is a multiversal energy vampire yeah.  He was introduced in the 2000s as kinda like “Spider-Man’s Doomsday”(Superman’s death) with not much backstory, but later his family became the villains of the first Spider-Verse event.  I don’t really think Miguel would fit a Morlun, but I do think there’s a possibility they might pull a Superior Spider-Man and reveal Doctor Octopus has taken over Miguel’s body since Superior was an important player in the original Spider-Verse and a fan favorite as well.  However I personally think it would be better for Miguel to just be himself and learn to accept and move past his grief as a character rather than the action movie reveal that he is someone else.",2023-06-04
"I don't think Miguel is being set up to be a twist villain, but I'm still skeptical of straying from the canon being the reason that universe he slipped into collapsed on itself.  
 
The blob thing in Mumbattan was clearly a result of the Spot messing with the collider. Not to mention Gwen's dad quitting the police force seems to be proof-positive of being able to stray from canon without things going to hell. If you go even further, Peter B. being happy and married with a child also flies in the face of how Peter is usually depicted (it may not be a coincidence that this happened after he had his first adventure with Miles in the last movie).  

I think Beyond is going to reveal more about why Miguel's universe was destroyed, and how he's wrong about anomalies being the reason behind everything going wrong in the multiverse. We still haven't seen Madame Web or heard anyone utter the phrase ""web of fate,"" so I think there's more to this than the movie is letting on.  
 
As for Miguel being tangentially-related to vampires: I do remember there being a panel in the first issue of Spider-Man 2099 where he appeared to have fangs for a second (it was a dream sequence/throwaway gag).",2023-06-04
"The baby isn't in danger. There's a reason Peter is (stupidly) going into battle with his daughter.

Canon requires that the spiders have a tragic origin story and MayDay is about to get hers.

"I suspect that the footage and reasoning given by Miguel is at best partially lacking. If nothing else, since this movie more or less directly references MCU multiverse stuff, we would except ""cannon breaks"" to lead to new verses, not collapse existing ones. 

Given all the various givens, it seems unlikely that predestiny of those exact event variations is actually entirely locked in, there are probably other factors involved in the collapse Miguel saw. I don't think we had anyone besides him confirm other collapses - there was stuff happening in Mumbattan but also that was impacted by a multiversal being blasting himself with a super collider so that's a terrible data point AND the captain wouldn't have been in danger there in the first place which makes the whole ""canon-destiny"" thing a bit off.

Could be Miguel's not actually a villain and just grossly misunderstands the situation, which would be my best guess at what's in store.",2023-06-04
"Peter B will probably become her ‘Uncle Ben’ in *Beyond the Spider-Verse*. Peter B either dies sacrificing himself to save Spidey-Miles from Prowler Miles, or he dies sacrificing himself to save Captain Morales from Spot.

"Exactly. It's editorial that keeps them apart in attempt to keep Peter seeming young and relatable. 

Thing is, they have a young relatable Spider-Man, so why not have a slightly less young and relatable one and let him get married.",2023-06-05
"I need a scene where Miguel is blaming Miles for being an anomaly/not wanting to let his dad die just so Miles can scream ""How the fuck is that my fault?"", while throwing a truck at him for good measure. That man needs year round therapy sessions amd a massive chill pill. ^^Preferably ^^a ^^suppository.",2023-06-03
"The thing is, *every* Spider-Person has to lose both a close family member/mentor and an amicable police captain. According to Miguel's algorithm, it's not enough for Miles to only lose Aaron because no Spider-Person can only lose one person.

The ""Uncle Ben"" loss forces the understanding of ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"", making them take up the mantle. The police captain death (event ASM-90) during the early tenure as a Spider imparts the knowledge ""Failure is an important, painful inevitability"". It's meant to humble the Spider into recognizing their own limitations, ensuring they don't maintain an arrogant attitude that causes greater loss of life down the line.

Of course, the point ultimately is that Miles wants to subvert those absolutes, but they're canon events in all other Spiders' lives for a reason.",2023-06-04
"It’s not about enough, it’s about specific events. Every Spider-Man loses an uncle Ben equivalent. Every Spider-Man also loses a captain Stacy equivalent. Miles lost his uncle Ben, he still hasn’t lost his captain stacy",2023-06-04
"My head canon is that since Aaron was the prowler, it didn't count. Like, obviously the loss is tragic, but I think even Miles can recognize that Aaron chose to play the game and lost. It's different with his dad, who is a ""good guy"" and the source of his moral compass (the way Uncle Ben was for PP).",2023-06-03
"This is my big problem with the movie tbh. The movie wants us to think Miguels mindset on this is a villainous one, and it is, so why did no other Spider-Man out of literally thousands ever defy this? It’s a fundamentally anti-Spider-Man idea and I don’t get why all of them went along with it and believed it. And the excuse that “we tried to defy the canon once and the universe got fucked so we never tried again and never questioned it further” doesn’t work imo.",2023-06-03
"Are you going to ask this question in reality? 

All of us are doomed to lose so much. We will all lose our parents (or we will die before them, which is probably worse). We will lose our loved ones. When is that enough? Why should Spider-Man expect it to be any different?",2023-06-10

"The Spot is one of my favorite Spider-Man villains, and I was initially a little worried about them making him into a bit of a dork. But Jason just started low and slow and just ramped it the fuck up. When he was letting that anger flow through? He was fuckin terrifying",2023-06-04
"Which is kinda stupid considering it's not the writer's decision to stick to the status quo, it's the people who are giving those writers their paychecks.",2023-06-04
That makes a lot more sense!,2023-06-03
"I think there's a very obvious set-up that Miguel is wrong about things. He has to be. Because that's what Miles is set out to prove. I don't think it was merely ""changing the canon"" that destroyed his universe, but something specific to how he did it - pulling a Rick Sanchez and taking the place of his counterpart, something akin to what we heard of in Multiverse of Madness. 

One potential issue with this is Spider-India's universe being in danger, but that might just be (at least partly) because of the Spot's presence - I'd have to rewatch the film (which I plan to) and probably wait for the sequel, too. So I'm waiting to see how things play out.

We do know (or it's heavily implied that) Gwen's dad didn't have to die; he was saved indirectly by Gwen revealing her identity and him subsequently quitting his job, and the universe seems alright. So if something like that works, there has to be some way in which Miguel is wrong - at least, that's what I think. 

Maybe it won't be exactly how I envision it; perhaps it's a broader issue than what Miguel specifically did - he does imply there have been multiple cases after all, and I doubt they were all life swaps. But I think ""you can't try to save these people, even if you know what'll happen beforehand, because their deaths have to happen"" will be flipped on its head. I don't think the answer will be what Miguel believes it is - the whole point is that Uncle Ben's death was preventable. It didn't have to happen. And the film is very much set up as a ""you have to defy what others tell you"" story - the narrative is clearly on Miles' side. 

But I also don't think it's necessarily out of character that, faced with the dilemma of letting one person die to save countless others, Peter…chooses to allow the individual to go. If there's really no other option. I think Spider-Man PS4 did this very well - of course, he set out to save everyone, but he got the cure too late, and ultimately chose to let his aunt die, which didn't strike me as out of character at all - instead, it encapsulated it. Ben Parker died because he didn't understand responsibility; May Parker died because he did. 

Given how high the stakes are, what the cost could be, and what Miguel showed of his experience...I don't think it's an unthinkable choice for their characters. Because even trying to defy that in the heat of the moment could, as far as they know, doom everyone in that universe; that's a tremendous risk, an understandable deterrent, and pretty demotivational, even to Spider-Man. But most importantly, to them, it doesn't look like there's any ""winning play"". That's the crucial bit. 

Comparing that to Green Goblin's bridge ultimatum in the first Spider-Man movie or Peter's choice to save the villains in No Way Home...while both were gambles, there was still a clear goal at the outset. But here? It looks like the options are mutually exclusive. 

But even so, I don't think Miles is the first to go against it - openly or otherwise. Others were probably just sent home forcefully or, like Spider-Punk, stayed a bit more discrete. Miles was just the first to openly defy it and actually escape. We see some who are visibly uncomfortable with it, hesitant, or on the fence - especially when listening to Miles' arguments and accusations. It's their hearts going against what their heads are telling them. 

But when it came down to it, Spider-India wanted to do both, just like Miles. And despite what Gwen says, I don't think she'd let her dad die without a fight. It's much easier to say you're with Miguel on this, but in the moment, the closer that decision is, it's much harder to follow through, especially with those close to you. Even among those trying to catch him, we see people hesitating, like the woman working the DNA teleporter. Plenty didn't, of course, but in fairness, most probably didn't even know what was happening.

And obviously, we know Gwen recruits people who switch over to help Miles, and I expect many more to follow in the future. In any case, I hope this idea is explored more in the sequel and that we see the perspectives of many more Spider-Folk. 

But again, I think it'll be revealed that the Spider-People are operating under the wrong principle; it's not one or the other, there is another way, and Miles will prove it to everyone.",2023-06-02

if he capable of dividing his spots and multiplying them it over lol also he could technically kill and cut people because his spots are multi dimensional gates,2023-06-02
"always ? since when, the defeated spider-man on his very first apearence with easy. and now he is buffed to hell and the only reason he doesnt go against spider-man is because his deal was kingpin.",2023-06-06
"Just so. He's a pain in the ass until he realizes his own potential.

Just a mediocre painter bigot until he realizes he has a strong speaking style.",2023-06-11
I like that even in the first goofy fight you could tell that fighting him and his powers would be a huge pain in the ass,2023-06-02
"He's the first teleporter I've seen who looks like a threat and I love it

The only threatening teleporter I've seen was in Skulduggery Pleasant books so I was digging him so hard",2023-06-02
"Remember when he said, ""Echo, Echo...no echo"". lol",2023-06-05
Spider Folk is so much better than Spider People (like I had been saying).,2023-06-02
he quickly adapted to his powers pretty insane and he understood his power can warp multiverse plus if he can observe future and unlock quantum only way he losing is either a cosmic spiderman or being higher dimension than him lol wonder what observers and etc are doing lol,2023-06-02
"Wow... I feel so dumb. I spent the whole movie thinking he was ""villain of the weak"" not week. This makes a lot more sense.",2023-06-07
"The trailers for this movie were amazing. I had no idea what this movie was going to be about and I thought the Spot was going to be a villain but not the main villain. 

Maybe like how Prowler or Liv were in the first movie.",2023-06-02
i'll be honest with how much the trailers were pushing miguel chasing miles i'd thought he'd be the main villain and spot would just be a one-off miles takes down early. but when he absorbed the powers and started acting super sinister i was so into it,2023-06-02
You thought the Spot was the distraction from Miguel but Miguel was the distraction from the Spot,2023-06-03
His inverse color form was legit scary looking.,2023-06-02
You made me swallow my hole! It's gonna be in my digestive track for seven years!!!,2023-06-02
I was thinking “He sounds like David Spade’s brother or something…” I’d just watched The Benchwarmers too lol,2023-06-06
"Jeff's completely earnest question ""Spider-Man, why'd you create that guy?"" sent me",2023-06-03
"thats the difference between Spot and Miles. Technically, Miles was only reacting to the hand he was dealt, a hand he was \*given\* by Spot, Spot started with a clean deck but messed it up on his own and blames Miles for his own mistakes.  


I love that there is a parallel to both and there is a clear point where their paths diverge. One just rolled with the punches, and made the best of what they had, while the other blamed the world around them even when these events were consequences of their own actions.",2023-06-04
"Okay I really love that explanation, especially about Miles relationship with all the Spider's. It makes so much sense, and really makes me want Miles to be right about everything, as I was on the fence before since the death of everyone for one life seemed like a really bad tradeoff no matter how much you cared about that person.",2023-06-06
"nah I don't think so... the spot is part of Miles universe which had his spider-man in the peter parker that died. 
the ""missing"" spider man has to be someone in the universe in which miles lands at the end of the film.",2023-06-03
No the Miles who became the Prowler (cornrows) was supposed to be bit. The Spiderman Miles (afro) whose story we are following was never supposed to be bit because his universe already had a spiderman. (The blonde Peter Parker who died in the first movie),2023-06-06
Not at all. It's a movie that encourages discovery as you go ...,2023-06-11

ATSV and EEAAO: Bagels are trouble,2023-06-02
"I would not be surprised if they added the line about the Spot being Bagel Guy as a reference to that film, especially given that it received a parody poster in this film à la the first film’s alternate *From Dusk till Shaun*.",2023-06-07
God I hate abbreviation so much. What's EEAAO?,2023-06-03
"WHAT, that's crazy",2023-06-02
Doctor Strange had the Pizza Balls sold by Bruce Campbell.,2023-06-02
"Dr Strange had the third eye parallel with Evelyn’s googley eye in EEAAO

There was a bit with a sandwich in The Orville,2023-07-02
"Honestly, when I read u/Megaclone18 's comment I thought at first they were referencing EEAAO and 'getting bagel'd' was now a verb for multiverse shenanigans.",2023-06-04
"The bagel definitely wasn't random in EEAAO. It not only illustrated the point about the arbitrary nature of life that the rest of the absurdist comedy did, it also mirrored the googly eye (black circle with white center v.s white circle with black center) with each representing the different forms of nihilism.",2023-06-11
"no, a retcon is when they change something retroactively. this is just a reference to something that happened in the first film",2023-06-04
"The exhaust port is a retcon, but adding story to a character that wasn't explored in a past movie is not a retcon because there's like nothing to build or construe because it's just a random scientist.",2023-06-02
"Lucas planned out many details before the original sequel and Spider-Verse was always meant to have an expanded world, there's no evidence of a retcon.",2023-06-02
he’s making a joke. It’s a reference to a line in across the spiderverse,2023-06-02
Woooooooooosh,2023-06-02
I mean the bagel doesn't really have anything to do with it lol,2023-06-04
"Yeah someone told me elsewhere, I haven't seen ITSV since it came out totally forgot about kingpin murdering Peter",2023-06-02
Yes but what about Parker from universe 42?,2023-06-25
So much of that world is tinted purple as a hint. Pretty cool.,2023-06-02
The computer said it was sending him to universe 42. I was like “oh shit.”,2023-06-04
That’s a fair guess. Lighting goes nuts in this movie.,2023-06-02
"Also, Prowler Miles has more of a Hispanic accent because he has more influence from his mom since his dad isn’t there",2023-06-03
"Speaking of which, Nike better have a version of those Prowler Jordan's next year",2023-06-02
oooo good catch. i did feel like there was something off about her.,2023-06-02
"Yeah that was the first detail I caught, then I started looking for confirmation and noticed the layout of his bedroom wasn't the same. After that it all clicked",2023-06-04
And those green eyes were gorgeous!,2023-07-23
"Glad I wasn't the only one who noticed the resemblance to Green Goblin in NWH!

The second I saw that, I thought it foreshadowed some Green Goblin (who was noticeably absent from this film - I can't even remember a cameo) or that Miles was about to go crazy.",2023-06-02
I saw this too! Wondered if it was a continuity error,2023-06-12
same,2023-06-19
I knew Jimmy was up to something. It was one after Magna Carta,2023-06-03

Hitchhikers guide universe is joining the MCU confirmed,2023-06-13
"She probably didn't now it was the wrong universe, am but was in support of him in the end. Notice she was part of Gwen's party at the very end",2023-06-09
"I don't think so. If I remember correctly, she appeared as part of ""Team Save Miles"" at the end with Gwen et all. Makes me think she's on his side. I could be wrong though!",2023-06-11
Her name is Spider Byte :),2023-06-08
I mean did she even know he was going to the wrong one?,2023-06-07
"Wondering the same!! Did Miles incorrectly input, or did she adjust it?",2023-06-06
Cute name for something so freaky.,2023-06-07
"No the number was on a spider, not a fly.",2023-06-02
"To be fair both Spot and Miguel made a big deal about Miles getting bitten by the spider from 42, but if you missed it on the screen during the go home machine scene, then you probably wouldn’t see the twist coming.",2023-06-03
"They make quite a big deal of 42, it appears in countless shots on the back of the spider right from the opening montage through the revelation that it wasn’t from his universe. I’m not a super fan or anything but it had definitely clicked for me by this point that “42” was the significant unknown universe.",2023-06-02
"my entire theater laughed at that, including me. I think everyone though the same thing: she didn’t really notice or care about spiderman. I didn’t realize he was in a different universe until right before Aaron showed up.",2023-06-05
"Except that Jeff has probably birched to here about Spider-Man every day for the last year.  I thought she was fucking worh him, but when it became obvious she wasn't joking I knew.",2023-06-08
"Just saw it today, I missed that he went to the wrong universe AND I missed the reveal in that line, for the first couple seconds I was like ""how does she live in New York, with her husband doing what he does, and she doesn't know who goddamn Spiderman is!?"" And then it all clicked I felt like such a fool haha. Awesome twist and a fantastic movie!",2023-06-21
Earlier in the movie she and the dad talk about Spiderman being Puerto Rican too.,2023-06-03
"My wife caught it immediately when it scanned and said it was sending him to ""earth 42"". She was like, ""wait, isn't he not from there?""

So we spent the rest of the movie wondering whether we were wrong or being bamboozled",2023-06-09
"She also comments on his hair, I was like ""lady you just saw him"" then it made sense.",2023-06-05
"Oh shit, that one’s good.",2023-06-04
I don't think that universe's Miles would be that sentimental about a toy. Probably would've sold it off at some point.,2023-06-05
"I think even ""evil Miles"" has two different color eyes",2023-06-02
"That's because his universe's (1610) mom made that comment, not Earth-42s mom. This is the first time we've seen Earth-42 as far as I'm aware",2023-06-04
"It can be, and is, both.",2023-06-03
ok comic book guy,2023-06-17
"Same thing here. Love seeing that someone else felt that.

Also, both her scenes and Gris brought me to tears. It was just too beautifully done.",2023-06-09
"Do it. I've read everything she's in. Nothing tops her original run. Some great twists on Spider-tropes, and easily my favorite artwork of any comic line.  


I watched the first spiderverse movie just to see her, and seeing her world and origin story in this movie was an absolute treat. Price of entry was paid for in that first 15 mins alone.",2023-06-04
same here its so menacing,2023-06-11
Nomination for best picture is definitely possible. Don’t think many people believe it would have a chance of winning.,2023-06-11
Best animated.  This person is saying it has a shot winning best picture overall,2023-06-02
"I’d say animated film is almost a lock for it, but really unsure about best picture. Oppenheimer and Dune Part 2 will likely be the big blockbusters nominated.  Rest of the nominees will be smaller films most likely - maybe even ones we haven’t heard about yet.",2023-06-02
Yeah I didn't even clock he went to the wrong universe until he glitched then Uncle Aaron walked in.,2023-06-04

Well. You might but...

"I watched it all last summer as a 29 year old and I gotta say, the people were right. It's probably my favourite animated version of the character",2023-06-02
"You won't regret it but just be prepared for an unfinished ending unfortunately. :( 

The dream for another season lives on..",2023-06-02
"It's my favorite version of Spider-Man, bar none. It takes the best parts from the original Lee/Ditko and Ultimate Spider-Man and leaves it the worst parts. Josh Keaton is the Spidey voice I hear in my head when I read the comics.",2023-06-03
Let us know what you think! Its my favorite spider-man cartoon,2023-06-12
How'd it go?,2023-06-20
"Not only Spider-Man the character, 

but also the Flash, Eddie Brock, Mrs. and Mrs. Conners (love them), and of course, the absolute best Norman Osborn. Which is a HUGE bar with William Dafoe, but Spectacular Spiderman surpassed it for me.   
Not only was he a maniacal Green Goblin, but he was a very scary cooperate overlord and a scary father. I think Spectacular's version of him is the epitome of what I'd call the ""\*Chef's Kiss\*"". All the right flavors blended so well. 

I think they also had the perfect Tombstone, my favorite Dr. Octopus, my favorite Sandman, and my second favorite Jameson.   
Granted, I haven't read all the comics, so I don't know how much was faithful adaptation or creative liberty, but so many many characters were on point. 

Plus, the natural progression of Spider-Man's foes just made so much sense. The fact that all the bizarre super villains were just a natural response to Spider-Man makes so much more sense, and has that nuanced ambiguity of Vigilante work. (And totally [illustrated this concept from the MCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09kfdMsUbKw) so casually and so naturally, way before Avengers said it.)",2023-06-20
He's still in high school so makes sense.,2023-06-12
“Video games? I love video games!” when looking at the video game villains,2023-06-02
"second, i missed it as well but i feel like he was saying he didn’t belong there so if anyone could clarify. i liked how we all assumed the spidey with the white spider was insomniac spidey, but the actual one in the movie was straight up the video game model",2023-06-02
"I didn't quite catch what he said, but he spoke when the cages were being shown. I think, at least",2023-06-02
I was gonna say I definitely didn't remember that. Sucks to realize this prob also makes Spectacular's Gwen equally doomed. I was really hoping they would go another direction in season 3,2023-06-02
"Yup it was. He’s been having a great summer so again good for him, he deserves it.",2023-06-06
then explain to me.,2023-06-06
"im very glad i got a quiet, awestruck theatre for Infinity War. it was surreal. when i went to see it again with friends, everyone was screaming crying like OMG NO0 SPIDERMAN",2023-06-03
"Everyone was so somber in mine. It was actually insane that I got to experience that. Opening day, 9pm thursday. Everyone just walked out shocked.",2023-06-03
"Tbf, it was announced to be part one of two at the very first trailer. They just didn’t really make a big deal out of it and everybody kind of forgot… which worked perfectly.",2023-06-05
"Yeah, I think I would be less annoyed if they announced at the start of the movie it was a two parted, like dune.",2023-06-05
"Why can't you watch the next one?

Unless I misunderstand you and you meant, you can't watch the next one *right now*",2023-06-09
"Not to mention that as other people have mentioned in this thread, we got a start of and a resolution to Gwen's story so the TBC wasn't quite a slap in the face anyway. We had something wrapped up, and the TBC is just for the rest of the overall plot. 

It also helps the next thing is due next year so there isn't much of a wait time either.",2023-06-04
Opening night vibes man.,2023-06-19
It being in a box would've been such a cool detail,2023-06-05
"I would agree with you, except the whole thing with canon events is almost certain to be subverted in the final film.  

JK Simmons is probably a *substantially* more persistent fixture than mere canon events/fixed points in time/whatever else they call them!",2023-06-04
He did such a great job that I just learned that it wasn't Simmons voicing him in the game. I just assumed it was considered how much it sounds like him.,2023-06-02
The position is open for a reason I guess. 🥲,2023-06-08
"Spider folks lose their uncle, which he did. 

And the captain of the police force also dies - which just so happens to be miles dad.",2023-06-03
There are multiple canon events that each spiderman goes through,2023-06-04
"Im pretty late as well, just watched it myself! I think thats the whole issue between miguel and miles. Miguel and Miles have a short line about this ""how do you know its going to happen?"" And Miguel responds ""we dont want to find out!""

And it makes sense from Miguels perspective. He tested his luck and the algorithm/canon event predictor has not been wrong yet. Miles is a special case and everything really is possible to him. So he may be the exception to the rule. Especially when Miles knows he is the original anomaly, he absolutely will push his luck.",2023-07-19
"I don't think canon is established until a universe has a spiderman, so Earth-42 simply didn't have a canon to break.",2023-06-04
The rules are intentionally left unclear and not certain as a central plot and character motivator. It's clearly part of the central tension of the film and will factor heavily into the resolution in part 2/BTSV.,2023-07-12
This. Exactly how I felt. It’s like u end the movie right at gandalf arrives and before the ents march on isengard.,2023-06-03

Considering how underwhelming Venom has been I’m not surprised. I was worried that was the only live action cameo until Donald showed up.,2023-06-03
"Same, best cameo in there period",2023-06-03
"I wouldn't have realized it except my son & I have been watching every spider man adjacent movie leading up to seeing this in theater, so we watched venom like 2 days before. I love anything spidey related & venom in particular so I actually liked the movies. Although Eric Foreman Eddie will always be my favorite lol.",2023-07-04
"Definitely not nobody, some random girl in my theater loudly said to whoever she was with ""this is the venom universe.""

Thankyou Captain Obvious.",2023-06-03

"It was actually Spider-Man 2. Someone on the /r/spidermanps4 reddit figured it out a few weeks back. The minimap in the movie matches the one in the showcase gameplay video. It’s distinctive enough for it to not be the PS4 game.

Edit: [Here’s the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/13qantp/spiderman_2_sneak_peek_in_recent_across_the/) What’s even more impressive is that OP found it *before* the gameplay reveal. Our first look at this game was from a TV spot of an animated film.",2023-06-02
I loved to see a short film of Ganke just playing Spider-Man PS4 in the dorm.,2023-06-02
Yeah and his Heung-Min Son poster! Absolutely love that guy great footballer lol.,2023-06-02
Ganke is a Tottenham fan too lmao.,2023-06-03
"Which raises the question of whether Miles and his family are characters in that universe's version of the games, and if not, who replaced them? I assume it's like the Spider-Man comic Miles has in the first movie, where the broad strokes are the same, but small details like names and faces are different.",2023-06-02
I love the departure of how Ganke ISN'T Miles' guy-in-the-chair here since he clearly doesn't need to be.,2023-06-04
"I know this is nerdy over-analysis but wouldn't that make Miles' secrete identity public knowledge since the game gives that all away? Ah well, it was a cute reference haha",2023-06-09

"I didn't notice that, thanks! Although I am only on my 1st of many watchings.",2023-06-03
It was so wonderful to see Spectacular Spider-Man. Probably got to me the most out of every reference or variant spidey.,2023-06-02

"Recognized him entirely by Josh Keaton's voice because his Spidey kind of stuck out in a weird way during that Miles intervention scene, because it was sort of uncanny valley and I wasn't sure til I heard him speak.

Love spectacular =)",2023-06-02
I immediately pointed out at the movie screen when I saw him!,2023-06-02
did he have a cgi model or did i see wrongly? he doesnt seem 2d animated to me in the scene,2023-06-02
I spotted that too!,2023-06-03
"Nice catch!  I saw that and had no idea what it was, lol.",2023-06-04
He played Miles uncle in Homecoming,2023-06-03
Hear? He actually shows up in live-action.,2023-06-03
"In the scene with the laser prison cell things, there were 2 cells with I think Green Goblins (the one on the right was apparently from some old Atari game I wasn’t familiar with lol)

And PS4 Spidey in his standard suit is standing in between them and says something, and I’m 99% sure it was Yuri Lowenthal the voice actor",2023-06-05
"He did, voice any everything. He was between the 2 Green Goblins",2023-06-11
"There was an MCU mention at some point, right?
They mentioned Dr. Strange and Peter, I think",2023-06-02
How fucking crazy it is that Andrew Garfield had a cameo but the movie just relentlessly throws so much cool shit at you that you just kinda forget?,2023-06-02
"I think it's a certainty at this point. They dipped their toe into live action in this one, I'm expecting them to go all in for the next one. Potentially even a whole scene in live action.",2023-06-02
They showed Holland grieving over Stark when they were showing the Uncle Ben incidents throughout the multiverse,2023-06-03
I think we see Holland and 90s animated Spiderman in Beyond. Those were the only two I didn’t see,2023-06-02
"I'm pretty sure there's a bit of Tom Holland when they talk about Spider-Men losing their uncles and the computer screen shows various Spider-Men mourning Uncle Ben, with Tom Holland's Peter sat on a bed looking at Ben's suitcase from FFH.

Obviously it's just archival footage, but it's about the same as we got for Maguire.",2023-06-02
I think we’ll get all 3 of them as voices in Beyond.,2023-06-02
Holland shows up in a sort of holo-video when talking about loss. From Endgame.,2023-06-04
"Call me crazy, but I think there's a chance we saw Holland's uncle Ben death from above at one point. It all flew by so fast, but something about it looked off to me.

(Not ashamed to say I'll be deleting this when I watch the movie again and am proved wrong)",2023-06-05
"they couldnt use footage from marvel movie, that is why they only reference strange.",2023-06-03
Where was Tobey?,2023-06-06
Holland’s in the credits but I don’t recall actually seeing him.,2023-06-04
I'd be shocked if he wasn't honestly,2023-06-05
I gasped loudly when I saw Andrew and then Tobey,2023-06-11
"Wait where was Tobey and Andrew.

Holland appeared. When they were talking about canon events we saw Tony's death.",2023-06-15
Late to the game but we did hear doc oct’s “hello Peter” from no way home in one of miles’ running away scenes,2023-08-10
"Hey, he said he thought it was Spider-Man's fault. He never said *which* Spider-Man.",2023-06-02
"That wasn’t a plot hole, tho. There were no set rules about the multiverse/how the spell affected the multiverse in NWH, it fit with what they set up.

This is just added information to explain it",2023-06-02
"It wasn't confirmed whether he was Prowler in the MCU, if he were he wouldn't have just told Peter about it

There's no proof either way but Occam's Razor is this Prowler is the same guy from Homecoming and his backstory is basically similar to Prowler from 1610",2023-06-04
Now we need a cameo of Michael Cera as Shaft to fulfill the prophecy.,2023-06-02
He also already played uncle Aaron in his cameo in Spider-Man homecoming,2023-06-02
"I definitely think this cameo implies he already exists and was active off screen, just got transported to another universe temporarily. 

With reliable rumors that Miles is in SM4 and SM4 being a gang war type of film with several villains after Peter, Glover’s Prowler could easily return there.",2023-06-02

"I think it was the other way around. The online push was to have him play Spider-Man in the upcoming Sony reboot (a part which ultimately went to Andrew Garfield). The scene in Community was a reference to that online campaign, and in turn was what inspired Bendis.",2023-06-03
"Wait, I thought Miles had been around longer than that? Your saying his first appearance was after Community aired?",2023-06-03
If there’s a story then I’m all for it but what’s the point of having that amazing casting just in proximity but not using him?,2023-06-03
Ooooh. Thanks!,2023-06-02

No Way Home was fueled by pure nostalgia.,2023-06-04
This movie handled the multiverse way way better than NWH did,2023-06-04
"No Way Home was just ""fan service spectacle: the movie"" whereas  Spier-Verse while has way more fan service / cameos, have a way better story, characters etc.



Even spiderverse used cameos and references far more effectively, they literally used Tobey/Andrew scenes to explain Canon Events. MCU has never used cameos this effectively for the story.",2023-06-05
"NWH, GOTG3, and Shang Chi were the only good ones",2023-06-05
Spider-Man movies seem to be our only hope when it comes to Marvel nowadays. They’ve been consistently good.,2023-06-03
"No Way Home was kinda shit ngl

Wanda absolutely carried the shit out of Dr Strange 2 and i ended up liking it, but mostly just because of her

Guardians 3 was good and i feel like it's a great place to finally stop watching Marvel movies",2023-06-03
I thought Dr. Strange was good. Wakanda forever was top tier and Guardians was amazing. Thor wasn’t good and Antman was decent but not amazing,2023-06-02
No way home was always a terrible script/laughable cgi/unfunny jokes/character assassinations mess of a movie that banks on cheap nostalgia and the purposeful hiding of Andrew and Tobey just to build hype. Across the spider verse is a great movie through and through with the added benefits of great cameos.,2023-06-02
"My biggest complaint is that these movies used to appeal to everyone of all ages and used to be family friendly. They were all a “root for the hero” and “good prevails in the end” through perseverance. That’s not the case anymore. 

As a dad, I haven’t taken my kids to see almost any of the phase 4 movies. We saw MoM and it gave my 10 year old nightmares for a week. Shang Chi said “shit” probably 47 times and now they’re throwing in “fuck”. There’s not many parents flocking to the theaters with their kids under 10 to watch these movies anymore. Same goes for conservative middle aged and older people. I feel like marvel has abandoned their core audience and geared their content to be mature and adult themed which doesn’t fit. Phase 1-2 look and feel nothing like the newer phases and they wonder why the movies aren’t doing good",2023-06-03
"Like others said Guardians was great imo, Black Panther was ok but too bloated, which is sadly understandable because of Chadwick Bosemans passing",2023-06-10
"Guardians of the galaxy 3 was the best marvel movie in years. Other than that, yeah I agree.",2023-06-21
"I think Black Widow had great parts, and I did enjoy the overall product, but it was just a complete tonal mess

Starts off as a Bourne style spy thriller, then when she meets her sister it turns into a full blown buddy cop comedy and David Harbours character is hilarious, then you get to a generic 2000/2010s sci fi action movie cgi-fest finale",2023-06-08
"Oh yes I enjoyed NWH and Shang-Chi, but everything after that has been average so I’ve been a little wary of Marvel since — will get onto GOTG3 next.",2023-06-06
Those were good!,2023-06-10
"I mean...if you make a multiverse saga, and call it the multiverse saga, you should expect a lot of multiverse stuff.

"Two different takes on the Batman verse and different enough to be hard to say which is better.  I think Joker works as a non super hero movie as some pointed out it's derivative of Taxi Driver but that's not a bad thing.

Where as Batman is a great reboot movie that doesn't focus on his direct Origin as much it focused on him becoming the Batman we know the world's greatest detective.",2023-06-05
"I don’t particularly care for either of those. 

The F4’s powers are just lame, as are the characters. And as for the X-Men, I remain to be convinced how they can fit into the MCU considering what motivates them as characters doesn’t have a place in that universe. Plus you cannot find better actors for the characters than Sir Ian Mackellan, Sir Patrick Stuart, and that Australian bloke",2023-06-18
I had issues in my Dolby screening too!,2023-06-04
"My Dolby was actually a perfect 75-80db when I saw it. Usually it’ll go 90-100db, I was very pleased",2023-06-05
i was in dolby and the beginning was hard to hear but it got better later. still a great movie!,2023-06-08
"Saw it in Dolby, but agree that the opening segment was a little low. It got more balanced later I thought.",2023-06-07
"I just got out of a Dolby screening; still had the same issues as others have described, and someone else in this thread mentioned the sound being strange in an IMAX as well…something is just off about this “print” of the film I guess.",2023-06-03
I just left my dolby screening and I still had the same issues. And my hearing isn’t bad,2023-06-04
Do you guys have ability to mix vocals versus other elements? Or is it just that you turn the whole sound up altogether?,2023-06-02
">Punk

yeah i could not hear a single word that man was saying.",2023-06-03
I was no joke questioning my hearing. Like “oh no all those concerts finally caught up with me”,2023-06-04
As a mix engineer I guarantee you that was the intention. With a movie this high budget there is no way the mix was bad. Also. Because this movie was so high budget the dynamic range of the audio was probably a lot greater(well more intentially emphasize anyway)and the theaters playing it just didn't raise the volume enough when this movie played. I watched this in IMAX and the action scenes and music didn't feel as loud as they should have been and I was sitting dead center. I had this same issue watching John wick 4 in IMAX,2023-06-05
I started wearing ear plugs to movies a few years ago and it’s amazing. You can still hear everything that happens in the movie and it blocks out any people whispering around you. Highly recommend.,2023-06-03
Dude I did the same thing. The mixing was totally off and my theater sounded like it was in 2.1 the whole time. Like I don’t think the side or rear speakers were even on. Huge let down that really soured the experience.,2023-06-03
"It’s a shame, I can only ever see it for the first time (in Imax, too), once.

Goddamnit.

It was incredibly noticeable that the mix was off and that all of it was too quiet in general.",2023-06-04
">Don't think it's a movie issue; seems like a theatre mixing issue.

It's a movie issue, I saw it in Europe yesterday, same thing. They pulled a Nolan.",2023-06-02
"The parts that were hardest to hear didn't have the dialog in the center channel. Just an odd choice, it made it so hard to hear.",2023-06-02
Watched it a few weeks back and I don’t remember it being as bad as Gwen’s,2023-06-03
"Something along the lines of ""That's the most emotion I've ever seen my dad show"" as he was stone faced shaking miles's hand",2023-06-02
Over here in Aus me and my roommates were complaining about the exact same thing. It had to have sounded like the speakers were broken because it sounded so thin. It really lacked the impact that the first movie's mix had.,2023-06-02
I was getting Rip Hunter vibes from DC’s Legends of Tomorrow,2023-06-04
Also it's very similar to Kingpin in the first movie.,2023-06-10
But what I don't get... miles has had his canon event. When Miguel was showing Miles the long line of Spider beings with their uncle Ben-like losses at the very end was Miles with Uncle Aaron,2023-06-02
Yeah I’ve got big “plot twist that will recontextualise all the other movies” vibes,2023-06-02
"I don't think he has anything to hide, rather that he wouldn't want to gamble and entire universe just on the possibility that it Miles being an anomaly would change stuff.",2023-06-03
"There is also the big difference of 2099 outright replacing another version of himself after he died, I think that is more likely to create a tear in reality than saving someone from your reality yourself (also kinda messed up? Like, clearly they had different experiences, they're different people)",2023-06-04
"Haha relax man I get why he was acting that way, I just thought that he blamed Miles for getting bitten and getting his Spider-Man killed which imo was not Miles' fault.",2023-06-04
"but also having sat on it, idk if i like that they all just sorta succumb to fate like that.  it really makes the gravity of their own choices not as important....",2023-06-02
"but then how did he get to Gwen's dad and back home? He had to have already made one for himself, right?",2023-06-02
He could have sent the watch to Gwen’s dad then go back just in time to help Miles out,2023-06-11
Thanks for saying this - I didn't know about this channel and am watching their breakdown!,2023-06-03
Shit was like a hallmark card,2023-06-04
I was actually a tad bit disappointed that the MCU did a reset on Tom's Spiderman to put him back to lonely poor guy.,2023-06-02
do you have any good runs to recommend? I have no idea where to start with Spiderman comics. I keep choosing runs that end up being sequel series,2023-06-02
"This was literally what happened in NWH, and it pissed me off so much.",2023-06-04
"I think it covers a lot more ground too, not just a critique of Spider-Man/superhero comics bound to a repeating narrative, but to the whole idea of classic coming of age stories in general, and the idea that the bildungsroman requires suffering, that pain is what makes you who you are and by extension you should simply accept the hurt the world puts on you as normal and unavoidable in order to join it.",2023-06-14
"I personally don’t fully agree with this criticism. Ultimately, Spider-Man is for kids. The whole concept is just perfect for a kid to lose themself in and daydream about (the whole double-life thing mirroring how kids have their personality/world at home vs. school) so to me it makes sense to always have a version of the character with that setup. No 6 year old wants to read about a Peter with marital issues - the character is so popular because he’s very relatable to the target audience.

This is in no way shitting on adults who like Spidey btw, since I’m one of them. At some point you just gotta move on though and realize it’s time for the character to connect with the next generation.",2023-06-03
"I was actually surprised when he said he was 15.

The dude looked like he could have been 17-18. I actually wished they made him that age. He looked older than 15 to me.

It would have worked better for the theme of the movie too. A 17 year old is almost an adult, which I think works better for the movie.

I don't see a 15 year old getting away with the stuff that Miles gets away with. Yeah he gets grounded, but the Gwanda situation? It works better if Miles is around 17-18 instead of 15.

(This is a total nitpick. I still loved the movie)",2023-06-03
Wouldn't it be swell if Sony continued Andrew's Spidey and it's about dad Spidey. Sony please.,2023-06-03
"Insomniac Spider-Man was great for this. He was in his late twenties, and dealing with the consequence of broken relationships and a compromised career. It really capitalised on that human element of Peter, and placed itself in a time where it didn't have to retread the same ground.",2023-06-07
"Oh no. Writers might have to create something new? I stead of beating the corpse of the same 20 villains? Maybe take a look at someone like the spot and do something interesting with him?

Maybe spend six issues on Peter dealing with how he can't fix all of Mayday's problems as easily as he could fix super villain issues.  Coping with problems he's got no ability to readily solve after decades of super heroing would be interesting to see.

Let the man deal with issues like not being broke as fuck all the time. Touch on how different his life is now he's not in grinding poverty nearly always.",2023-06-05
more like capitalism manifest,2023-06-05
"It’s actually one of the reasons I was fairly unimpressed with Miles in his original portrayal, what’s the point of creating a new character just to make him nearly the same as Peter, but a different race?

The first Spiderverse movie did so much for the character.",2023-06-10
Did people really do this? I don't remember this,2023-06-03
"Of course, and well said.

I'm not really speaking toward ATSV so much as the films in general, and your excellent comment about the pattern got me thinking. One day I'd love to see someone >!cross that line and have a cocky Peter accidentally kill the love of his life!<. It's the moment that was always meant to shepherd him into adulthood.",2023-06-02

No.,2023-06-15
"Yeah, love how Miguel's monologue about Miles being an anomaly kinda mirrors the sentiments of the specific subset of the Spider-Man fandom that vehemently dislikes the mere existence of Miles as a character. Fucking brilliant writing.",2023-06-02
"It's not exactly subtle.  Not that it needs to be, but yeah, it was super on the nose.",2023-06-05
"Of course it has a meaning, but why does that meaning invariably end up being criticism of previous works?",2023-06-18
"Agreed.

I think an example of this is, to me, one of the more recent episodes, “The Big Fix”. I love the idea of gaslighting people into thinking that Tolkien was always named Tolkien instead of Token, and I do think the idea is really funny. But in practice, it felt really… venomous when it shouldn’t be, it’s as if it’s pissed with itself as much as other people.

Ironically for a show that constantly tells us not to give a shit about everything happening in the world, they get a bit sore when the fans raise criticism about how they handle the show. And they double down on it through making jokes how Randy’s the face of the show now (which in a way, I don’t mind, he’s a character that they could center on for real-world events without making him into a too much of a soapbox), but I think it’s too much of a good thing. 

But I will give it this, at least South Park feels real with Matt and Trey continuing to be at the helm of the show rather than feeling like a compromised product made with clashing writers like in Family Guy.",2023-07-12
"I had to read the detailed plot for the first movie (I watched it a bit ago), I didn't remember the quick clip at the end when Peter B presented flowers to MJ.",2023-06-08

"Same here, i figure this was a night scene and with miles in a panic that this was just that.",2023-06-07

And the fact they literally just spoke about a universe without a Spider-Man,2023-06-04

">	My argument is that it’s not the events that make them similar, it’s the lessons they take away.

Yeah but what I’m saying is that Miguel meant it was the events themselves that kept up the structure, the intersection nodes. What the spider-man associated with that event learns from it means nothing, so doesn’t matter what lesson miles takes from it, only the EVENT happening is what matters to keep the nodes connecting them intact.",2023-06-05

[deleted],2023-06-02
If Miles wasn't bit his universe's Peter probably would've killed Uncle Aaron in a fight (unintentionally) which would lead to Miles taking up the mantle of the Prowler,2023-06-03
The point is that since the radioactive spider was pulled from Earth-42 means that there was never a spiderman to protect that universe to begin with. Peter was never bitten,2023-06-03
"His dad death and a lack of Spiderman to fight the S6 is more likely the reason why the 42 Miles become Prowler.

You can hear it in the news, the S6 was fighting each other for the city. You can see it from the graffiti, Miles dad died in line of duty in a chaotic world without Spider Man.",2023-06-05
"My thinking is that if miles isn't supposed to be spiderman, why didn't his world fade away like Pavtirs? An anomaly such as spiderman dying, the wrong person getting bit by another worlds spiderman (why doesn't earth-42 fade away either?)

It's all Canon. Miles is supposed to be Spider-Man and somehow Miguel and Peter misses this.

Edit: I rewatched the movie and the scene where spot is talking about how he took the spider 42 from earth-42, it shows the spider hanging directly over Miles-42 (anti-miles). Assuming the double braid hairstyle isn't extremely common",2023-06-02
We don’t know if they’re criminals. There’s a version of the Sinister Six running around in universe 42 that Prowler Miles could be fighting with his uncle.,2023-06-04

"Yep. I had a relatively strong emotional connection to the Guardians and 3 did a good job playing off of that, but ATSV hit me *hard* on multiple fronts. Miles and his parents, Miles' and Gwen's experience with the other Spiders, and *especially* Gwen's relationship with her dad (and how it related to her experiences with the other Spiders) were each individually far more emotionally resonant for me than all of GotG3. Obviously this is a subjective matter, but ATSV was just head and shoulders above any other comic book movie for me in thematic and emotional impact.",2023-06-04
"I think the way Spider-Verse applies more supernatural concepts (like different timelines) to real-life issues that people go through is much more enthralling than how GOTG3 did it, and it concerns the concept of “show, don’t tell”, or to me, “show more than tell”.

I love the scene where Gwen saw Miles’s collectible figure and rips the box out because it wasn’t like that in her world, it shows how Gwen’s world was different compared to Miles. I just love how in general how Gwen feels like she’s doomed to never have a normal life due to the universes she sees where either her or her friends die. Guardians 3 could have done so much more with the Peter and Gamora subplot that tackles similar themes, and it wouldn’t have bugged me as much if this wasn’t the last movie in the series.

I also really like how the arguments and close moments Gwen and Miles’s families are given equal weight, where most of the time we see the Guardians being at odds with each other in some way, like I get that’s how a family would act, but the positive moments matter as much as the ugly ones.",2023-12-03

">Greetings, life-long nerd here.  You make an excellent point with The Empire Strikes back...but as someone who was there for that, there *is* a difference.  
>  
>When Empire came out, nothing like that had ever happened up to that point, and it was absolutely mind-blowing.  I will never forget how it felt, one surprising shock after another...Landro betraying them all, Han being frozen in carbonite and taken away by Boba Fett, all while Darth Vader is fighting with Luke, cutting off his hand and telling him that he is his father(!!), Lando coming to his senses and getting them all out of Cloud City, then saddling up in the Falcon with Chewie to go rescue him and flying away, while Luke and Leia watch from the window with the droids...and then THE CREDITS START ROLLING?? WTF??  I still remember my pre-teen jaw going slack as it literally dropped open...I ended up staying in my seat and watching the entire movie again, stunned (something that you could do back in the olden days, before reserved seating).  With ATSV, we went into it fully knowing it was a two-parter, much like The Deathly Hallows and Mockingjay.  The only thing that has ever even come close to that feeling for me was the end of Infinity War.  The gut-punch that we all felt at that ending was super reminiscent of the dazed feeling I had while walking out of Empire.  
>  
>So, to sum up, I agree with you when you say we won't be able to fully appreciate ATSV (as amazing as it is) until BTSV comes out, much like how ROTJ wrapped things up with a bow (with some flaws IMO but that's a story for another time lol) - but there definitely was more to it with Empire, just from the shock factor alone.",2023-06-04

We know of at least one person whose attitude changed after learning about the consequence of trying to avoid a canon event (Miguel).",2023-06-02
"I think a lot of Spider people would try to do both. Miles would and Pavitar was going to try before Miles stepped in. But the ones in the film are the ones hand picked by and aligning themselves with Miguel's ideals, at least to a certain extent. And they've created a huge ego eco-chamber.",2023-06-02
I feel like every Peter/Miles/Gwen who had no knowledge of canon events will try to save everyone regardless. The whole spider society is hypocritical in that they only agreed on that aspect after their own canon event already happened. No one can refute Miles when he asked if they would've saved their uncle/captain/whoever if they were still alive. It's easy to make that choice when you're already on the other end and making it for someone else.,2023-06-04
"Great point about the canon event with May.  Long before seeing spider verse last night, I had always wondered about Tom Holland, Peter Parker not having the big sacrifice of losing uncle Ben. While sad, It was a great way to bring Tom Holland Spider-Man into the canon of the rest of the Spider-Man super having to lose someone special to them. To make them realize how important their powers are.",2023-06-02
"I wonder how correct Miguel is, like if you stop the canon event before it even starts, does that change the path? Like did Gwen legitimately just save her dad's life by him resigning at the end while not messing with the timeline? 

Earth 42 had a massive canon event change with no one becoming spiderman in that universe, but that universe is fine, assumedly because the change wasn't made at the canon event point. I figure most of the Spidermen never had to make the same choice with the same perspective as Miles, all of their canon events likely already happened or wont happen. They hear ""dont fuck with the timeline or your world will be destroyed"" and the debate ends there without having to make personal choices.",2023-06-03

That's EXACTLY why Miguel didn't bring him in.,2023-06-02
"> Except is he? In this movie almost all Peter's agreed with Miguel about letting someone die if it's preordained. But in NWH, Peter refuses it. He tries to save everyone. (Which funnily enough brings about his canon event with May)

Well most of these Peters had already gone through their canon events, but I think you can be pretty sure that most of them would have still tried to save whoever died in their lives even if they knew ahead of time about canon events",2023-06-02

Both Tobey, and Andrew didn't want to kill them, they were forced to or couldn't save them. So Tom isn't unique in this aspect at all, if anything what makes Spider-Man is trying to save everyone no matter what. You could argue Tom would let people die if he knew what cannon events even were. (Same with Andrew or Tobey) but I'd hope they'd all be like Miles tbh lol.",2023-06-04
I think the whole thing was that most spideys don't know the person is going to die before they do. All the spiderpeople who were agreeing with Miguel had already lost someone,2023-06-05

"Maybe most of them were brought in fully after their captain had already died except for maybe Gwen, who Miguel didn't want to recruit initially/yet, and the Mumbattan one was maybe still under probation and didn't know his captain was about to die.

Maybe Miguel's speech is usually a ""easier to apologize after than to ask permission"" one.",2023-06-04
"I think that's by choice.

Miguel needs people who can follow him blindly and not question his stuff. Or atleast accept his logic and don't come into his way. This shows that every Spiderman while a good guy is not equal.

People like Holland, or Miles are a threat to his mission that's why he actively avoids bringing them in 

I'm not saying the spiders who join him are not good guys are anything. Just that the heroes of our story in any of the movies we have seen have a morale toughness to them that may not exist in others and that makes them really special",2023-06-05
"Well all those Peters have already gone through their canon events. MCU Peter, like Miles, is a new spiderman whose story is being told. That’s why Tobey and Andrew’s appearance in NWH is impactful for Tom and the audience, like with all the spideys in the Spiderverse. They’ve all tried to have it all and do both, and they’ve all failed like Tom and Miles just had. But Miles simply just isn’t having it and refuses to accept that his story is already written for him. Come to find out hes not like the other spideys and if anyone can rewrite their story, Miles has the best shot",2023-12-14
How do the canon events relate with Kang? It looked like sacred timeline rules to me.,2023-06-04
"Didn't he already have it with Ben though?

And didn't Miles already have his canon event with uncle Aaron?",2023-06-13
I think the difference tho is that very few Spider-Man have ever been in a situation where they knew a canon event was coming. Most of these guys have already “suffered” through their canon events and also no one else without Miguel’s knowledge actually has access to any technology to know of or cause a canon event in the first place.,2023-06-17

"Yeah, definitely. So, a true victory ending the film on a climactic note with a sequel hook (as in the first Spider-Verse where Miles defeats Kingpin, but then Gwen calls out to Miles in his room as the final scene). When I say a false victory, I'm referring to heroic conclusion to the action - Miles outsmarts Miguel and is able to escape from Earth-928 and gets to tell his mom that she was right, he beat them all, etc - but it's the wrong universe. Instead, he's stuck in a dark world without a Spider-Man and the Spider Society is actively hunting him down. In the moment, he's stuck and has no allies, that's the change in status quo.

[TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoActStructure) calls this a ""rise and fall"" structure where the first act is more lighthearted and the second is darker.

This is pretty common in musical theater where there's an intermission separating Act 1 from Act 2, but you'll also see this in television where there's a commercial break at the midpoint, in movies pairs that aren't intended to be entirely standalone (Kill Bill is a good example. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 are also a good pair here), or even within a single film where a decisive moment happens halfway through (Like in Titanic where the ship hits the iceberg nearly exactly halfway through). There's often a time skip as well.

Some examples of the end of Act 1 from musicals:

*Les Miserables* ends act 1 with ""One Day More"", set at the eve of the 1832 uprising. The students prepare for revolution but Javert is spying on them, Éponine despairs that Marius doesn't love her, and Valjean is about to exile himself.

*Wicked* ends act 1 with ""Defying Gravity"" where Elphaba leaves the Emerald City and Glinda. When act 2 starts, time has passed and she's now the Wicked Witch of the West - a change in status quo

*Hamilton* has a true victory in ""Yorktown,"" where America wins the Revolutionary War, but it continues for a few songs through ""Nonstop,"" which ends the first act with a false victory showing Hamilton's ascension to Secretary of Treasury while establishing the beginning of his downfall with Eliza begging him to stay with her and Angela moving overseas. Act 2's change in status quo is marked by Thomas Jefferson's introduction.

*Hadestown's* false victory is ""Wait for Me,"" where Orpheus successfully begins his navigation into the underworld to rescue Eurydice, but act 1 doesn't end there, it ends with ""Why We Build the Wall,"" a hopeless call and response between Hades and the workers of Hadestown. Here, Eurydice joins the underworld properly and begins to lose herself. Act 2 of course takes place entirely in the underworld, so that's the change in status quo.",2023-06-16
"God I hope not. If I’m paying for a film I would expect it to have a narrative start, middle, and end (obviously this isn’t always the case and so I rant). Although Dune also left me wanting more, it being the first film and taking its time to set up the setting and characters is more warranted and narratively understandable compared to this film acting as a sequel. 

I can’t imagine Dune Part 2 ending the same way Part 1 did and I’m sure you would hear more complaints.",2023-06-03

Idk I just thought it was weird that in a world where spiderman is supposed to help people and almost create an equality and comradery in NY that Miguel's NY was so oddly dystopian.

"Theres so many little hints that definitely seem to point towards exactly that. Another thing that happened was that shot of him being injected with something that turned his eyes red - in the comics he was working on a spider - super soldier serum thing for alchemax  but was forcibly mutated, permanently, for trying to quit. Since his work was killing people. 

I'm pretty sure this is a variant of Miguel that did actually go ahead and complete his work due to that scene. The universe 928 also might not be his original one, mile's lightning was glitching him out and I'm pretty sure it can't do that normally. But if it messed with his watch? 

I'm not sure what its all pointing to in the end, but the dude is definitely a pretty big mystery. I'm just hoping its not a buildup to another edge of time 'You don't know the first thing about being spiderman' scene, feels a bit cheap to change his backstory around to get it there",2023-06-02

"Eh.

It probably just feels different because it's straight up live-action.

and honestly...I don't see the harm.

To me, it worked fine. I guess the suspension of belief only goes so far with some people though.

If there were any film to get a bit self-congratulatory, it was this film. Plus the moments did at least match up with what the scene actually demanded. It wasn't there just to be there.

I guess it just befuddles me. The concept of this movie is already wacky enough, so I guess I don't understand why the line is drawn with the live-action stuff. (I know you said it was the gratuitous nature of it, but to me...the whole movie can be seen as a gratuitous love letter to the superhero genre...while also deconstructing it.

Those scenes we watched are basically described as part of the horror of being Spider-Man. It doesn't actually celebrate those moments. They critique why they're necessary to begin with. Those weren't happy moments.

and as for the Doc Ock thing, I saw no issue with it? 

Actually, I was wondering if they were going to have the balls to show the live-action stuff. I figured they never would, but to see it as part of the multiverse too....that was pleasantly surprising to me. It really made it feel like anything was possible.

I even dug the possible dig at the MCU where the asian lady just acts totally unfazed by The Spot. This shit is just so routine to her that it does even register as a threat. To me, that was a critique of how nothing in the MCU feels at genuine stake anymore. (Using deadpan irony instead of playing things straight).",2023-06-02

It wasn't with the purpose of bullying him, but pushing him to see if he could get up again.",2023-06-03
That’s true. You could probably tweak that subplot a little bit if you wanted the movie to feel like it had more of a conclusion.,2023-06-03
"I can see your point that some conversations in the film are maybe more tell than show, but I think the conversations do still serve a purpose in the movie and to the audience. That's why I disagree with how u initially described them as ruining the pacing or lacking gravity - even if you would rewrite those intimate character scenes to leave more unspoken those scenes still served a clear purpose that the audience can clearly see is a serious moment. Some guy yelling out gay in your theater doesn't make that moment poorly written.

I think there also are a lot of ""show"" moments in the movie still - the way Miles has so many drawings of Gwen or how Gwen is clearly very attached to that photo of her and Miles together. Yeah they still have a conversation with each other and express to each other that they missed each other, but there's a lot left unspoken there too and the moment feels believable because of what we've seen from both characters reintroductions since the events of the last film. Maybe this is something Id notice more or less of in a rewatch.",2023-06-03

"I don't know anything about filmmaking but I do watch a lot of movies. It didn't feel redundant to me so I would have to agree with you about it being ""lazy."" In fact, when you have a movie with as much action as this one I feel you need a lot of quiet sections to give the film dynamic range, especially in a film with so many emotionally heavy themes.

5. Miles and Gwen need to make up/get together.
6. Miles needs to be honest with his parents.

And of course that's not even considering *new* complications the next movie could introduce. I expect at least three big scenes: a confrontation between Miguel's team and Gwen's team to rescue Miles, a confrontation between Miles and The Spot to rescue Miles's dad, and a confrontation between Miles and Miguel over the fate of the spider-verse/Spider Society.

There is still quite a bit of story from this movie, and similar to the Gwen plot fron this film, Im sure there will be a Beyond the Spider Verse sub plot that will give the film its own self contained arc",2023-06-02

"So let's cut that. About 5 minutes before we get into the plot that she mentions. Don't mention that it makes no sense to cut it because the whole shtick of Spider-Verse is meaningless and stupid narration recap. That's its thing. Now say we cut 15 minutes elsewhere. Not only is the movie too rushed and has no room to breathe (hint: it wouldn't be as critically acclaimed if you cut 15-20 minutes), let's make it 3h15 minutes which is way too long. That leaves us like 1h15m to resolve these plot points:

1. Miles escaping from evil Miles
2. Gwen getting Miles back to his universe
3. Figuring out the mystery behind the sketchy character that is Miguel O'Hara (seriously. he doesn't seem like a real spiderman _and_ he has to get a new spider to bite him often)
4. Figuring out the whole canon points thing (are they real? not clear because Gwen's dad quitting *should've* dark mattered her universe)
5. Probably another cool fight scene with Miguel
6. Teaming up against spot. Includes saving Miles' dad (or failing to do so)
7. Doing something with the romantic tension between Miles and Gwen (this would probably happen right before the big act 3 battle I assume? but worked on all movie before the big breakthrough moment)

Could you technically do that in an hour and 15 minutes? Yeah, in the same way you can recap a movie in a minute. It makes for a bad movie.",2023-06-04

But since it IS a part one, I could probably point out literally a half hour of redundant character re-introductions and repetitive parents/Miles conversations that could be on the cutting room floor. Easy. Snip snip. And no disrespect to the artists involved. It was for a 'every frame a painting' kind of movie but the script could have been pared WAY back. It felt, to me, like it had been fluffed out to justify the more lucrative move of splitting it into two movies and that makes me feel like they did a disservice to both the film(s) and the audience just to make more money.",2023-06-11
You think the first movie was more fan service-y than this one??,2023-08-08

Everyone he cares about is getting gathered in the same place, and there are now multiple different threats. Miguel strikes me as someone who is willing to take a hostage to save the multiverse. 

The real canon event is that Spiderman can't save everyone - but a key component of this is that Spiderman is never supposed to actually acknowledge that as a fact. Sacrifice is noble, but spiderman isn't supposed to intentionally sacrifice anyone, including himself.",2023-06-03

"I agree with you but I guess the main point I was trying to make was that not all movies have to follow that structure. 

Infinity war/endgame is one of a kind part 1 and 2 for the reasons you mentioned but similarly to my point before, not all the part 1 and 2s should follow similar story structures. 

To each their own on the structure and the state of it not being a standalone movie. I think though after the third movie is released, the entire trilogy will be one of the tightest and interconnected trilogies of all time. Becoming one of those types of trilogies (Back to the future, LOTR) means you have to either have a sequel as good or better than the first or have an amazing final film that circles back to the first film. 

If the third film manages to meet the thrill and intensity of the second, the spiderverse trilogy will manage to nail both those factors I mentioned to become a perfect trilogy. 

If u critique the second film still because of its unconventional storytelling and how it doesn’t standalone, I get it. 

I think miles said it best for his trilogy “imma do my own thing.” If I wanted to watch the “traditional” movie like you outlined then I can just watch the MCU. 

If you’re a Spiderman fan, this shits a masterpiece through and through.",2023-06-30

"Keep in mind that scene had to be ready for the release of ITSV some 5-6 years ago. They had the very basic outline of what was going to happen in the next movie and that's what we got to see initially. Now, over the course of these 5+ years, the writing is gonna solidify more and things are going to change. 


That's all that happened, the story and timing changed and so there's slight discrepancy between the movies because of the creative process. That's why Gwen's dad and Peter look different in ATSV than they did in ITSV",2023-06-11

Also my wife very much got a 'tv series' feel from it rather than a 'movie' feel from it which I can also appreciate. I think that's a side effect from having two two-and-a-half hour films. Like if we're looking at five hours of movie all told, there's a pretty good argument for making it a series. Like that goes for Dune, too, and other films like that. Well, we'll see how things go.

"From Miguel's model of the world it isn't, but Miguel's model of the world doesn't reflect all the countless universes where spiderman DOES save his captain. 

The idea is that ""destiny"" isn't defined by some extrinsic model of the world we create, it's defined by your own actions. On a larger narrative, it's saying that we don't have to write spiderman's origin the same way every time just because that's what's familiar. In-universe, Miles does not believe fate is predestined. Miguel believes it is. Which one would you rather be true?",2023-06-04
"No, it is absolutely not. 

everyone here keeps downplaying the interference and disruption of the canon events, but think of this way. 

What if we discovered, in real life, that you could essentially 'play God' (if you will) with the fate of the entire universe? Now we further discover that ""playing God"" in this case really just means messing with something that is supposed to happen in a very specific and certain way and not even that you can do magical things or give back to the universe somehow. Just that you are interfering with a certain event instead of letting it happen freely as it should. Now we further discover that there's absolutely **ZERO ZIP NADA** potential gain and/or benefit either material, immaterial, concrete, conceptual, measurable, quantifiable, tangible, or anything at all...basically we don't get a microscopic nothing out of it, and now we further discover that 1 person is solely making the decision here all by himself and he's a CHILD too and he's doing so completely secretively and away from the knowledge of everydamn person in this world. Even his identity is a secret to his own family and loved ones (except for some random cameo kid/roommate for whatever reason). **FINALLY**, we discover that this monumentally and unfathomably important decision of immeasurable weight being made by this minor/child is about whether he wants to save the life of his beloved dad whom he very much adores and looks up to and is undoubtedly emotionally compromised with the worst case of conflict of interest ever. 

Oh and this decision might someday end up destroying the whole universe, and possibly even before this kid's dad lives out to the nature end of his lifespan thereby meaning that the dad's life wasn't even saved anyways. 

Lol ya can you imagine how fast the **entire** world would unite, sworn bitter enemies and nemesis for countless generations, to bring this kid down?

"> and I would say that Miguel shouldn't have been cracking jokes either even if he's a spiderman since his character is supposed to be cynical, dark, and brooding

Once the conflict between him/Miles gets going I don't remember too much humor from Miguel. I just remember stuff like him throwing away the snack Miles brings him and Miguel putting up with Mayday crawling on him. He's dark and brooding but he's still a good guy from a certain point of view, especially for him to have the trust from literally every other Spider-Man. 

> yes, and we find out her dad already realized he was wrong like a week after she was gone so it basically resolved itself off screen

That could have easily been how that scene plays out if Gwen had stayed (and Gwen's only mistake was running instead of giving her dad a chance) but I do see  what you mean. Gwen just does nothing and everything is alright after Captain Stacy sleeps on it. Feels like something was missing there.",2023-06-05

Does any of that mean the movie is bad? no but is it the best thing I've ever seen? No. I consider this to be a underwhelming sequel. I believe people are just in the honey moon phase and people will recognize the shortcomings the same way people did with endgame.",2023-06-05

Cuz it looks like Miles is out and about doing who knows what out on the town, and the girl he's been having wild sex with is awakening from a nap in his room. They are annoyed and are about to rage about it but they get interested in what she's saying.

"It didn't happen with ALL of them, we see a whole team of defectors right there at the end of the movie. It isn't a stretch to believe that Miguel was only recruiting spidermen who would co-operate -- it isn't like he recruited Miles or Holland's who were known to go against the grain. He only recruited Gwen after her father found out who she was and against his better judgment since he felt bad for her.

And then there is some proof to his statements as well -- Pav's ""Captain"" didn't die, so suddenly the universe started unraveling, easy to use situations like that as justification to keep other spidermen in line.",2023-06-06

"> he was on a mission to save the multiverse

no he wasn't. he came to the spider HQ to calm down/talk to Miles when Miguel was gonna tell him about the event and why he couldn't join

"It's clearly shown that there's more than one canon event, Uncle Aaron and miles dad are explicitly shown to be two from the same universe (why does Miles, an apparent 'mistake' has canon events in the first place?) Miles points out that Gwen's dad is a ""captain too"", so it's safe to assume that, had they let it run its course, Gwen's dad would have suffered the same fate.

And sorry... Who was the person who transported the spider to miles? Surely if we're going by cause and effect it would be Spot who actually causes the problems in the multiverse? He causes Miles to become the anomaly, which causes Miles to set off the events of the film. But that's not even my point, because ""who did it first"" is reductive to the story. Miguel is the villain here because he's wrong about canon events in some capacity, and is willing to let people unnecessarily die to protect a fabricated status quo. He uses Miles prior actions and his own experiences to justify his actions.

Oh minor correction but Earth-42's Miles, not peter parker, was to become that Universe's Spiderman (before the spider was taken) based on one of the frames from the film. So essentially swapped destinies.

My logic apparently 'defeats' me yet your entire argument makes no sense. On one hand you're criticising the film for being ""lovey dovey"" yet you're using said film's story to contrive an interpreted version where Miles is somehow the villain of the story. From a meta-perspective the directors are clearly showing us Miles as the hero and Miguel as the villain.

So which is it then? Are you interpreting the film in a way that is polar opposite to those of it's makers? Or criticising said makers for overused tropes? If you want to say the film is bad because you're tired of these tropes then say that and go watch *Watchmen* again. Everyone has their tastes. But it's pretty weird you're trying to in-universe logic your way into putting your own message over the literal directors of the film. While at the same time, criticising the story of said movie.",2023-06-07
"The trolley problem isn't mathematical, it's ethical. If you only look at it as maths, you come to the conclusion that since 5 > 1, you should pull the lever every time. That's the conclusion Miguel came to.

Miles, correctly, remembers that [Spider-Man can do this.](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/02/25/article-2284273-18487F3F000005DC-604_634x311.jpg)",2023-06-07
"Personally, I'd say the trolley problem breaks down very quickly actually. In fact, I'd say right at about...how many people can 2 units of the average trolley fit together? What if we packed them in like sardines...from India. 

Let's just say 200 people for the sake of simplicity. 

Imagine an active shooter in real life puts a school hostage and says this one teacher can kill himself by swallowing as many of these costco-sized bottles of tylenol pills as he can until he dies of an overdose nice and peacefully and painlessly...or he can run away right out this door that I'm holding open for him. Teacher promptly runs out the door and lives to tell the tale. The gunman massacres 200 school children before his gun encounters a catastrophic malfunction and faulty ammunition explodes in his face causing shrapnel to go through his brain and kill him (you can thank Ulvalde cops for why I didn't change the story to be cops rescuing the kids)...how badly hated will he be forever if such a story came to pass. 

And ya that's not even **close** to the population of a small rural town, or a country, a single planet...much less the whole universe. 

That's what's at stake.

"I also think Miles dad would sacrifice himself if he knew he could, and I think Miles would try to save him even if it was an informed decision.

Miles is definitely trying to save his dad and the universe. If he thought saving his dad would doom the universe then that means he's trying to save his dad but let his mom die, and Ganke, and everyone else. Maybe including his dad, but just a little later than if he didn't save him. That doesn't make sense. He's gonna try to find a way to save everyone. I think he even says, ""I can do both,"" at least in the trailer.

Letting the multiverse die is def not okay, and I don't see how it being okay can be extrapolated from me saying letting infinite people die is *not* okay.

We saw the results of what Miguel did, and I understand why he wouldn't want to try again. Since he didn't, there could be a way to save everyone that Miles will find that Miguel didn't think of. I'm sure the writers will think of something more clever than me but here's one idea: If Miles is an anomaly then the canon rules may not even apply to him.",2023-06-07
"> you kinda just proved my point for me.

Cuz......I was agreeing. I was trying to show that Miguel's logic is reasonable and we follow a type of it ourselves. The only thing I don't agree with is dangling the ""your dad is about to die and we're gonna trap you here"" carrot in front of him.

"I feel like the real Uncle Ben canon event in Miguel’s timeline is not literally his own Uncle Ben, but the Universe that imploded. That’s his Uncle Ben. So in his timeline, each universe is the equivalent of a person to him.


I guess to translate that macro into a micro… It would be like… Miles saving a person vs Miles knowing that a cell in the person’s body has to die for the person to live. If the cells don’t die, they turn into cancer and kill the person.


Miguel probably looks at it like that. People are cells to him, and the universes are the living bodies/people to him.


Miles is ultimately going to humanize him though.


I love the poetry in this movie it’s too good. Because indirectly, Miguel is telling Miles that he can’t have his cake and eat it too. But yet, somewhere early in the movie, Miles says “What if I had 2 cakes, I could eat them both” which leads to him getting 2 ruined cakes for his dad’s celebration party, but I bet the better tasting 2 cakes are saving the microcosm & macrocosm :)",2023-06-03
"Indian-American here as well. I think I understand where y'all are coming from, the jokes and cultural references were incredibly tip of the iceberg level one things. It's not like ""chai tea"" has any serious significance to Indian culture, so the India section being filled with jokes like that can feel pandery and weird, cuz it's written as something Indians can go yeah that's true while also being very palletable for Americans to understand as the common joke.

Regardless, I absolutely loved the Spider-Man India section. The world was depicted so vibrantly and with so much color, Pavitr himself has a great design and for once is cool and not the butt of a joke like you said, and it was nice to see an Indian spider man on screen at all. I agree Miles is more relatable, but I mean that's cuz he's an actual character with a story arc and development. Pavitr never was supposed to be that, so I enjoyed just having him there at all.

I guess it is still pandering but I think it's nice you can still at least notice the effects of having an Indian in the writers room through small stuff like calling Singh Inspector Singh and not Chief or something, idk if Americans would've written that. Or the quip about Westerners always going to India on ""quests for self enlightenment"" and the British taking all our stuff.

"Peter B’s own Captain and Ben died already, so he didn’t know beforehand… Can’t really say he’s accessory to murder. From his perspective, he’s brought into Spider City, and sees every other Spider Man there went through the same thing, so I can see why he’d believe “Oh okay.. I guess this is what’s supposed to happen in every reality then?” It’s not like he’s hopping into all these other universes and killing the Captains or the Bens, so he’s not really an accessory to murder. Miguel explains that Doctor Strange & “The Nerd” + Miles, The Spider-Gang & Kingpin, are the 2 groups that have messed up the multiverse which he has to clean-up. It seems like all the anomalies so far have been random people being thrown into random universes, so he’s gotten a squad to help him take those people where they belong…


Miles being an anomaly himself probably means that he’s the first to know about the upcoming death, so it’d be the first time that these guys are “accessories to murder” (if Miles’ dad dies).


Gwen, on the other hand, didn’t have her Captain (dad) die yet, and she’s going along with it. But that might just be because Miguel is super-imposing, and she’s surrounded by a million other Spideys telling her “yup, it’s supposed to happen.” But yet, her dad retired from being Captain (saves her from being accessory to murder). So maybe, if you’re aware of the event before it happens, it gets avoided somehow? (Gwen, Miles) Gwen would have been an accessory to murder had she stopped Miles from saving Captain Singh— but she didn’t apply force, so it leads me to believe that when there is an actual person in danger in front of her, she isn’t fully Miguel-Mode. Had they captured The Spot, she wouldn’t have to even attempt to stop Miles from saving Singh— Because Singh would have just gotten killed a different way as fated to be. Thanks to The Spot, Singh is alive and Prab didn’t have to go through that canon event. If it were not for The Spot, Miles wouldn’t have been there, and Singh would have been killed as Destiny dictated it. Miles’ existence, however, is the living breathing anomaly. Also, the Spider-People were able to contain the hole/excursion that appeared when fate was changed.


I guess Miguel was hesitant to have Gwen & Miles come to Spider-City because then they’d be aware of what’s to come, and that’d disrupt the flow of things (because it is Spideys’ natural instinct to save someone they know will perish). The other spideys already went through it, and saw what happens when someone who already went through it, tries to change it elsewhere, so they rather not interfere unless they have to (Thanks to Kingpin, Doctor Strange & The Nerd, and The Spot).


If the solution does end up presenting itself, they would have failed being accessories to murder (Failed in India, Failing in Gwen’s Universe, assuming it fails in Miles’ Universe). After Singh was saved, none of them went out of their ways to kill him just for the sake of fate.


Furthermore, Gwen & Peter B. didn’t really actively try to physically stop Miles from escaping. And in the end, Gwen did round about all the other Spideys who are down for Miles’ ideas. This creates a split among the Spiders— People who are following Miguel’s way, and people who are down to give Miles’ way a chance.


In another comment, I looked at the imploding universe Miguel had witnessed being his timeline’s real Uncle Ben, and thus each Universe is like his equivalent of a person. And each person within all these universes are cells. So it’d be like Miles trying to save each person’s cells in their body, but saving those cells so that they continue living, would end up having them eventually grow as tumors, and then the person has cancer and dies (equivalent to an universe having anomaly events and then imploding/collapsing and dying). Miguel’s demeanor, imposing ways, looking like the elite futuristic Spider-Man who sounds like he knows better, feels like the Multiversal Spider-Man who saves Universes, so all the Spider-People look at him as The Spider-Man of All Spider-Mans. Then, there’s Miles, who says, No, there has to be another way. The Anomaly of all Anomalies. And now people are siding with him (The Spider Gang). Even the pregnant Spider Lady who’s in Miles’ Universe outside his parents’ house seems to be on board, as she let Gwen go do what she has to do.


I see what you mean but I don’t know— Maybe after a Spider-Man goes through every canon event—which are learning moments—they come to the conclusion that they can’t save everyone, and they end up becoming like Miguel? He is in the Future after-all. So maybe that’s why they don’t feel Spider-Manish… because their future self’s maturation lead them to be a bunch of Miguels, after experiencing so much sorrow, they have just accepted that this is the way things will be. Until, Miles appears in their lives, and he is now the new canon event that brings them back to their old ways.

I don't know if there's something just wired completely different in my brain to the people who found that exciting, but it just felt unsatisfying to me. I'm not really hyped for the next one, I'm just dissapointed I didn't get a movie with a solid conclusion.",2023-06-12

Infinity War still ended things on a cliff-hanger, and asked the question of how the heck would they bring everybody back and defeat Thanos.

however, he did not think far ahead to ask himself “what if I changed each ‘must-happen event’ and forced that change to be kept consistent across every universe?” That would still make those events must-happen events, for example, changing the canon event of “captain must die” to “captain survives” but going into each universe to make sure that same thing happens, thus changing the spider-verse for the better, and preventing the universes from being wiped out since they are no longer anomalies (can’t be an anomaly if the same thing is occurring everywhere). the evidence (captain singh, captain stacy, and eventually captain miles surviving) suggests miles will force a rewrite of the canon event, which’ll open up miguel’s eyes and show him the solution.",2023-06-03

If Gwen stepped in, and did something, then she directly intervened, which is what Miles is trying to do.   
Miles did this with Pavithr too, saved Captain Singh by violating the Canon.

"wait for the third one mate. plus they're kids \[Gwen is 16\], I was confused too, and my initial assumption was ""Oh they're together"" but there are rumors that he's gay, or Gwen kept him at bay and never engaged him aside from their music sessions. Chances are she was purely platonic, and leaving stuff behind is an honest mistake, Shoes are rumored to be a gift. at no point, it says or implies that they're emotionally/romantically involved. I think you've never had female-male platonic friendships. You're just assuming stuff

the never ""beta rolled"" Peter, I think she's yet to have her ""First"" romantic involvement. also remember, miles was not allowed in the HQ. You're kind of assassinating her character without a base and very obvious misdirect - jokes.

More or less, yes

Miguel validates if they're at risk of messing up a timeline or not, and if they aren't, he invites them to the society. 

&#x200B;

Thats why Peter B Parker got the invite too. Cause even though he knows Miles, he will still do what is needed for the greater good.

"Miguel doesn't say it's his fault. He just laid out the truth for him: The Spider wasn't meant for him. He wasn't supposed to be Spider-Man. If he was never bitten, he wouldn't have been down there looking for the Spider and Peter wouldn't have had to save him. If Peter wasn't there to save him, he wouldn't have wasted time saving and talking to him and wouldn't have had his focus split and would have escaped alive and destroyed the Collider.",2023-06-13

Remember, Gwen hasn't lost her dad yet either and him dying was supposed to be a canon event. And yet, when they talk about it with Miles, Gwen just has this face of defeat and acceptance that it was going to happen.

They were probably trying to replicate what happened with Gwen with Miles. And even if they didn't explain, Miles had enough information about what was going to happen that the end result wouldn't have changed.

He already knew that it was a canon event even if they didn't tell him when, and he figured out Spot was gonna do it. Spot already told him exactly what he was gonna do and he knows that Spot can Multiverse travel extremely quickly. That gives him an increasingly small timetable to act. If they didn't tell him the date, he'd still try to leave and they'd still have to contain him either way. 

It seems Miguel and Co. were in damage control mode.",2023-06-13

Really appreciated the representation.

Side-sidenote, but I'm an international student at a university in Canada- the connection between Pavitr and Miles felt like me and one of my closest friends. There's a connection between PoC that felt so accurate in the portrayal of how both of those characters talked to each other.",2023-06-08

The basic concept behind the character was a mix of Morbius (the Living Vampire) and Kraven (the Hunter), with a name and design based on both, but a backstory wholly unrelated to either.

Now, the reveal of the other Miles as Prowler? That would have been a great spot to end it.

That said, I liked where they ended it. It closed out Gwen's arc and set up the sequel quite nicely.",2023-06-09

"This is a decade plus fight with the fans.

Around the early 2000s Spiderman was clearly growing up into his 30s, getting married, being less strung out, hints of maybe having a kid with MJ. *Most* fans were generally okay with it having grown up with the character. 

Editorial, (specifically one guy) felt Spiderman was getting out of touch with his roots and wanted to keep the ""guy in his early 20s whose life is a mess and full of tragedy"" feel he had growing up. Singlehandedly retcons Peter and Mary Jane as a couple. Extremely unpopular. Continues for like a decade.

Recent comic book runs hinted at undoing the retcon before yoinking it away again. And once more, Spiderman is in this weird ""my life is a mess"" stage that most fans are getting old of very quickly. Like the comic editorial wants to freeze Spiderman in amber and never change or grow.",2023-06-05
"I actually disagree that his assumptions aren't wrong because of Mumbattan. The hole there is clearly a result of Spot's involvement with the collider, but Miguel is using it as further justification of his paranoid delusions regarding his idea of canon events. If they acted on realities that quickly, the two Miles' universes shouldn't exist by now since Miles is an anomaly with powers from another world and Miles missed the biggest canon event by not being bitten by that spider. I think Miguel is just flat out wrong.",2023-06-09
Ah ok! That makes much more sense than my half-baked idea xD,2023-06-04
"All of this. Miles was right when he said that accepting your Spiderlife is going to be depressing as hell simply ""because"" is messed up.

Also, his life is a contradiction by Miguel's logic. He's apparently both a Spiderman that doesn't fit inside Spider-canon because his spider was from universe 42, but ALSO he DOES fit inside Spider-canon because Uncle Aaron died and his captain-achieving dad's is predicted to die too. So which is it? Is he not a proper Spiderman who's breaking the rules? Or is he destined to hit all the canon beats of a proper Spiderman?

I think the 3rd movie is going to be about breaking the canon of what it means to ""be"" Spiderman.",2023-06-04
"Okay, my thing is, Mary Jane presumably works outside the home, Aunt May is dead in his universe, and Mayday has already developed her powers as a toddler, so who can watch her without realizing that Peter is Spider-man?",2023-06-21
Meh it all tracks with what we've seen before in the MCU. Incursions can destroy universes. And in the what if? Series we see strange try to break a canon event and the universe is destroyed as a result . Miguel is correct and Jessica even backs him up. But what I think they're wrong about is that there's no way around it. That's going to have to be what miles figures out.,2023-06-05
"So long as Paul isn’t a canon event, everything’s gonna be fine lol.",2023-06-10
"I'm imagining that we'll see it play out that Miguel's logic isn't entirely sound or correct, and I hope we get to see it break down in this manner.

I mean, the three arguments of ""Your dad dying is a canon event"", ""you're an anomaly because of the spider"", and ""if you break the canon your dimension gets glitched to destruction"" don't play together well *at all*.

If our Miles being Spiderman is an anomaly, and the universe ""corrects"" anomalies by glitching the dimension, then this shouldn't be an issue. Miles' dimension would have been destroyed by now. Earth-42 would have been destroyed too, because *not* having Spiderman is apparently a huge anomaly.

My thoughts so far are that Miguel is enough of a narcissist/is traumatized enough to have convinced himself that his entire world being destroyed was triggered by his own actions. We have no real proof that this is the case.",2023-06-03
I’m not sure Miguel would have space for a suppository considering the massive rod up his butt,2023-06-05
"So, basically in Miles’s case, it’s just an unfortunate coincidence that his Uncle Ben and police capt just so happen to be his Uncle Aaron and his father.",2023-08-14
Is Tony MCU Spidey’s Stacy?,2023-06-07
"I guess I've been thinking of Aaron as the source of his moral compass. Like, he loves his dad, but the constant flashbacks to the ""keep going, kid"" scene sort of parallel Uncle Ben in a way. I saw Mile's driving goal to be lowering the number of Aarons in the world by making sure that good people don't have to resort to bad stuff to get by.

It makes sense, though, that he might need a more lawful good inspiration to ""grow up"" and be the Spiderman the world/multiverse needs.

One other thing - maybe I missed it - but I didn't follow the logic of leaping from ""Uncles die, Captains die, etc..."" to ""my dad was just made Captain, so he's going to die now as a **canon event**!"" Again, if Miles is an anomaly, how does a ""rule"" like that even apply to his story?",2023-06-03
I assumed this was why they were somewhat selective about who gets contacted. They only recruited the Spideys that would be likely to go along with Miguel's perspective (and Spider-Punk just got in on cool factor I guess?).,2023-06-03
"I think none of the Spider-People (and cars) thought to defy the negative canon events because they already went through their negative canon event.  
From their perspective, they’re thinking “If I didn’t go through this horrible thing, I wouldn’t be here. He has to go through his horrible thing too.”  
What they’re not realizing is that their “darkest day” canon event doesn’t define who they are or where they end up. They can still be heroes without a sad backstory.",2023-06-03
Or maybe it's just all the other ones who defied it has gotten universes destroyed and gone,2023-06-07
"I mean yeah, eventuality of death is one thing. But saying ""this person is destined to be murdered at this exact moment and *I'm going to physically stop you from saving them*"" is an entirely different thing.

Like, in some ways it calls into question what being a hero even *is* in this universe. Why save anyone at all if the act of saving a person's life can literally tear the universe apart? I mean, this is more of a free-will and ""how do you not become paralyzed when the existence of destiny has been proven"" question, but it's one that stories like this tend to ask.",2023-06-10

"I had the same reaction. I can't believe I didn't clock that. The whole movie I was thinking ""who is the voice of Ben, he sounds so familiar"" and then I read Samberg's name in the credits and thought ""Huh, Andy Samberg was in this, who the hell was he?""",2023-06-03

I am sure the same applies if Miles meets/were to meet George and pulled that(a cop like him definitely would givehim  the ''have her home by 9'' spiel). But Black, Latino, Asian and nonwhite ethnic groups tend not to play that *especially* the older folks. 


We may be more aware nowadays how their generation can be unnecessarily stuck in their ways about some things, but I gotta agree with them on this one, it's definitely tacky. In job/professional settings or meeting a friend or *especially* a partner's parents, always use formality unless stated other wise(i.e. Please, call me so and so or Mr was my father's name)

Hopefully in the sequel when all this settles down they can redo introductions with a proper maam/sir or Mr/Mrs Morales.",2023-06-02
"That's all they are to you, eh?",2023-06-03
"But, the father would’ve died also if he was Spider-Man, if canon is to be believed.

So what’s the difference?

Imo either this miles would’ve been evil even if he got bit by the spiders, or is he isn’t evil as Prowler even though he wasn’t. I don’t really buy it otherwise.",2023-06-09

"I think the Canon point is a red herring. A lot of the story points are about shaping Spider-Man, but what happens after they're established.

"He's got the portal gun, we all know from experience now how powerful that thing is",2023-06-03
"Even in the first fight I kept thinking, all he has to do is teleport spiderman's head in the path of a bus, or close the portal on his neck. I don't even think Spot was seriously trying to kill Miles, or he easily could've by their second fight. He wants enough power to destroy Miles entire world and leave him desolate.",2023-06-04

"Makes sense. I'm going on intuition here rather than detail.

Is the scientist character behind Spot going to be some larger reveal, or is his nobody persona part of the point?",2023-06-03
I know this is a loose adaptation but doesn't the Peter Parker Spider-Man also die before Miles Morales becomes Ultimate Spider-Man? This coupled with the fact that Miles already had his canon event (his uncle dying in the first movie) leads me to believe that SM2099 is either mistaken about Miles being an anomaly or he has ulterior motives for targeting Miles,2023-06-08

Plus, Rustin is practically built for the Oscars, a biopic about a black gay civil rights activist planning the 1963 March on Washington. 

This isn’t even mentioning the lower-profile movies that have a chance if they get good reviews. Challengers, a Zendaya star vehicle from the director of Call me by your name; and Freud’s Last Session, where Anthony Hopkin’s Freud has a theological debate with CS Lewis and Tolkien, focusing on his lesbian daughter.",2023-06-04

At least Across the Spider-Verse can give them something to fix...though they need to show him glitching in and out",2023-06-02
Worth pointing out that he says he's against Vulture spreading around alien energy weapons that blow shit up but he was interested in the more lowkey tech useful for stealing rather than battle -- especially a gadget Vulture offered him giving him the ability to climb walls (which has always been one of Prowler's major abilities),2023-06-04

"Wakanda Forever sucked. I think people jusy look at it through rose tinted lenses because Chadwick died. If hypothetically the actor retired from the role instead of passing, and they made the exact same movie that they actually did, I dont think people would give it as much love as they have.

The script was messy, the cgi and effects were terrible in places. Ironheart was so messily forced in there. I found namor underwhelming 

Not to say there weren't great moments in there, there were. But the overall final product was very meh",2023-06-08

"Dr. Strange was definetly fun. Wakanda Forever started strong but tapered off, was a touch long as well. Antman was not really good. Felt like a mess. Those had its moments, both good and bad (Christian Bale was soooo good)",2023-06-04
"I disliked both Dr Strange and Wakanda Forever, both had too much hype behind them but were underwhelming af

I thought Antman was a fun movie with a lot of Rick and Morty-esque comedy, and is the only one since Spiderman that I watched twice",2023-06-08

nwh just hit the nostalgia jackpot so hard for me that i cant put it above spiderverse 1 since i saw that one at home and it‘s a different experience in a theater, verse 2 clears nwh tho",2023-06-03
"I also thought No Way Home was bad. It’s a small club but happy to be in it. There’s a solid Tom Holland Spidey movie in there that’s completely trampled by forced fan service. We really didn’t need to see Sandman and Electro again. I didn’t have any nostalgia for Andrew Garfield’s Spidey, and Tobey McGuire was barely in it and didn’t look like he wanted to be there. 

Also, they set the story up by making Peter Parker and Dr. Strange act uncharacteristically dumb. Green Goblin was great, the Holland-specific story beats were great. They should’ve just brought back Green Goblin and told a contained story about a really bad week for Spider-Man.",2023-06-03

"The multiverse saga is what is happening right now, and that name wasn't created until we needed separate distinctions in 2019 for the upcoming movies and the previous ones. This won't be over until 2026 with phase 6 and they have dipped into plenty of multiversal threats, so that is not true.

the universe you are thinking of is called the Infinity Saga, and that is absolutely complete with references to the infinity stones throughout the entirety of the 11 year span.

Infinity saga doesn't have to include the multiverse, but it did include build up for the infinity stones. 

I think you mixed up the saga names.",2023-06-02
"I really like The Batman's take on the hero origin story. It's not about why Bruce becomes the Batman, you know, gunshot and pearls in the alley.

It's about why Batman becomes a hero instead of a monster who wants to punish an entire city for what he's lost. Turning from inward to outward. Finding meaning in it instead of being one long, extravagant suicide.",2023-06-06

Yeah I saw it in Dolby too and Gwen especially sounded like she was quietly mumbling at times.,2023-06-07
"they mean altogether, the issue being having to turn the audio back down for different movies in the same auditorium. I haven’t seen a projector with separate audio track levels, but maybe I’m wrong",2023-06-03
"It depends on the theater, probably. Often, dialogue is mixed to come through the center speaker. So if the projectionist is able to turn the center channel up without adjusting the entire mix, it should make the dialogue louder. 

When I worked at a little indie theater we had separate amplifiers for each channel. I’m sure the big chains have them too but I’m not sure what those companies allow their projectionists to do",2023-06-07
No your not allowed to mess with the mix at most theaters. It's my projectionists despise Nolan films. Constant audience complaints we can't fix.,2023-07-02

"Thank GOD! I'm not the only one. I especially noticed it during the chase sequence where the audio feels like it should be coming from the back and the sides, but all of it felt concentrated towards the front audio channels.",2023-06-04
"This is exactly how I described it to guest services! It literally felt like there were entire audio channels missing. AMC gave me two free vouchers and seemed pretty receptive to my complaints.

Had to go out and ask someone to turn it up about twenty minutes in because I couldn't hear anything.

A guy working the theater agreed and thought the audio was messed up too.",2023-06-04
Saw it in Austria and there wasn't an audio issue.,2023-06-02
Same issue over here in California.,2023-06-02

"Yeah, he's had a canon event now but that's not at all how that was supposed to play out. If 42 Miles had been the one bitten, Prowler in our Mile's universe wouldn't have died.

So, yes, he's had a canon event now (and so has 42 Miles). However, to keep them ""connected"", our Miles still needs to keep having more canon events (since there's multiple), but he wants to stop that - and not have his father die.",2023-06-05
"There are multiple canon events, that was pretty clear. Not sure how this is upvoted, it was really easy to understand",2023-06-09
He may have destroyed his for show and still had a second one. I mean he did go around stealing parts.,2023-06-02

When I was 15 I got REALLY into avenger fam fanfics. Fics where Tony adopts Peter Parker and it’s just wholesome avengers being a family and trying to raise this genius dorky kid. Sometimes, but not always, it would have Steve and Tony be married as Peter’s dads (this was before winter soldier so that was the most popular ship in the fandom at the time lol and before all the avengers family angst).

And then Tom Holland happened and it felt like all my teenage MCU dreams came true.

Of course. I used to be a huge Spideypool shipper but I stopped after Holland because I just… I cannot picture Holland and Ryan Reynolds being in a relationship together. It’s too creepy and weird 😂. So that basically killed that entire ship for me lol.",2023-06-08

"J.M Straczynski run before Sins Past and One More Day disasters, he keeps a healthy life married with MJ and Aunt May knows his identity",2023-06-03
"Ultimate is always the go-to place to start since it's so easy to pick up and read, in its own continuity and with an actual ending.

But since people already recommended that, here are some great runs in the main continuity I would recommend:

-J. Michael Straczynski's run on Spider-Man (2001-2007) is really good. It has a few noticeable dips in quality later on, but the first two trades at least I would highly recommend. It does a lot of new and exciting stuff with the character and has some really on-point and quirky writing.

-Roger Stern's run (1982-1984) is fantastic, has a bunch of really great storylines and crime-drama stuff.

-Stan Lee's original run, and the subsequent Roy Thomas/Gerry Conway runs are also worth checking out if you can get past the slightly dated writing. Loads of great stories in there that pretty much every single Spider-Man iteration borrows from to some extent.

Also not a run, but Spider-Man Blue is a must read. Can't recommend it enough.",2023-06-06
"Just throwing one out there, but Kraven Last Hunt was a really good read and can fill you in on the new game coming out",2023-06-02
"I’ll be honest, most of my comic reading is super haphazard and uninformed so take this with a grain of salt haha. I loved Superior Spider-Man, pretty much all of Ultimate but especially the intro to Miles, Marvel Knights: Spider-Man (which I think was repackaged with a different name eventually), and then I’d say that run of Amazing Spider-Man with Stracynski (other than Sins Past and One More Day being dreadful) was amazing. Some really great adult Peter stuff.",2023-06-02
"I think that’s what new heroes are for or occasional resets and such. That’s what Miles was, for instance. But it’s okay to let people grow and change and introduce new options for the kids.",2023-06-03
"IDK if I agree with this whole take - the target demographic for comics has *definitely* shifted a lot over the past 60-odd years since Spidey first appeared. Comic books were originally sold at newspaper stands for kids to buy something when mom and dad , then grew into their own industry in the 70s and 80s, and by the 90s the most dominant demographic when it came to actually reading comic books were adults who grew up reading them as kids.

It's gone back and forth since then, but generally your average superhero comics tend to be aimed at a market between mid to late teen and adult. That's especially where Spider-Man has lived for the last few years. I think there is a lot of Spider-Man media aimed towards children, especially most of the animated adaptations, but if you're following Spidey in the comics, chances are you're not a middle schooler, you're someone who has been deeply invested in the character for a while, and if you tried to read the comics you'd probably bounce off of it pretty quickly because everything requires so much status quo knowledge that will just bore you. 

Just one example - Kindred was a character who first appeared in a 2004 run of Amazing Spider-Man (back when I was in grade school) - it's actually the alter ego of two people, Gabriel and Sarah, the twin children of an illicit romance between Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin) and Gwen Stacy before her back snapped in half in a story published 30 years earlier (before I was born), who aged super rapidly because of the Goblin venom in Norman's blood, who were brainwashed into thinking Peter was really their father, and that he killed Gwen. Then, in another recent story, 20 years after the original one (after I've graduated college and now work and live on my own, it's revealed that all that shit I just told you? Big stupid lie, not a word of it was true. The *actual* origin of Gabriel and Sarah is that they're actually clones of Gwen Stacy, not her children. And who was their creator? An evil, corrupted artificial intelligence copy of Harry Osborn's personality from the time that Harry Osborn was trapped in hell by the demon Mephisto whose sole objective was to torment Spider-Man because it was revealed once that Norman Osborn sold his son's soul to the devil to be more successful in business back when Harry was a child, which retroactively explains why Harry is constantly so miserable all the time, and the Harry we've known since another story from 2008 (written when I was a middle schooler) has actually been a clone while the original one is sending demon clone babies of his ex girlfriend to torment his bestie from high school. 

I'm not saying this isn't for kids because the story is deep or edgy or too difficult and confronting for them - it's just that kids really aren't the target audience for Spider-Man comics right now because the series is written by hardcore fans of Spidey who each want to make their own editorial mark, undo or retcon or retell their favorite or least favorite stories, and so everything becomes about trying to do something new or unique with stuff from 30 years ago which makes the comics really unapproachable for anyone who's not an entrenched fan or who's not willing to do a shit-ton of wikipedia surfing and back-issue reading just for something to make some sort of sense to them.

Even though in the cultural consciousness, Spidey remains a wisecracking teenager trying to balance being a high school kid with New York's greatest hero because that's what he is in most adaptations, in the comics, he's a whole ass adult who has lived a thousand lifetimes. He's been a reporter, he revealed his secret identity and became a full time avenger, then he was a high school science teacher, he's been married to MJ for years before giving up his marriage to save Aunt May's life, he got his PHD when his body was taken over by Doc Oc, started his own Stark Industries knockoff, then got exposed for plagiarizing his PHD thesis, lost his company, went back to couch-surfing, had a thousand different relationships, etc. The Peter Parker of the comics is so far removed from our common understanding of Spider-Man that trying to keep that Spidey alive in the comics absent a hard reset on the entire universe is a waste of time. There's a reason that Ultimate was so well-loved - because it quit trying to tread an awkward middle path between original Spidey vibes and the growing and changing audience of Spidey fans who want to see their favorite character get out of the rut he's been stuck in for 20 some years.",2023-06-03
">No 6 year old wants to read about a Peter with marital issues - the character is so popular because he’s very relatable to the target audience.

I started reading Spider-Man when I was at that age. This was around the middle of the J. Michael Straczynski's run where Peter was married, which at that point he had been for almost 20 years already.

I grew up with a grown up, married Spider-Man being the status quo, didn't seem to prevent 6 year old me from becoming obsessed.",2023-06-06
"I think part of it is that the spider bite grants superhuman strength so in a growing kid you get this growth/muscle spurt. But I agree that adding two years to the gap between the first movie and this would have benefited it. When his parents are talking to the counselor the first line of dialog is ""we know we have two years"", why not have him going to college within a few months?

"This dates back to before the Marc Webb movies when Donald Glover said he wanted to play Spider-Man. There was a huge backlash from comic nerds and there was even a letter that one fan wrote that spiderman couldn't be black because there were no black kids like Peter Parker. 

Miles Morales debuted in comics in 2011 and this controversy happened around 2010 or so. I didn't realize at the time, but Miles likely exists as a clapback to the gatekeeping from the spiderman fandom.
So his whole character arc about being an anomaly that wasn't supposed to exist and the whole theme that anyone can be spider-man is definitely intentional.",2023-06-03

Miguel is wrong. His universe was destroyed for a different reason, and he was so overcome with grief that he assumed it was his fault, and took it out on all the other Spider people.

Same with Miles. He got bit by a different dimension's spider. He wasn't supposed to be spider man. So his universe was altered.

"It wasn't a flop, but *Into the Spider-Verse* **way** underperformed relative to its brand recognition and quality. I get that it was hard to market, but just about everyone who saw it was levitating out of the theater. The upside was the next couple of years of people finding it, having their socks blown off, and the animators on Twitter describing their labors of love.

My favorite was a drummer mentioning how much they loved the three second Gwen Stacy drumming scene, and the animator chiming in with all the experience and love she brought to it.

""We just thought, “What if that was actually what the character looked like?” So we developed all these crazy technical tools. They start with this traditional animation pass, and then the tools that we developed can adapt all the different parts of him to all these different custom looks we created that are based on classic punk rock posters. And we can assign all these body parts very distinct emotional beats wherever we wanted them to appear like sudden visual changes. I think that process probably took two or three years to develop, and we really only came together like right at the end.""",2023-06-03

Just want to interject since the movie finally came out where I live and say that Prowler Miles is probably a mislead.

">(telling Miles that he is what he is, no mater what he's told)

You know, thinking about it now, Hobie was definitely told about Miles being an anomaly threatening the stability of the multiverse and his punk side was already like ""ah yeah, fuck the system!""",2023-06-04
"These movies have captured so beautifully the struggle for us teens of trying to both be with our friends and help them and care for them while being told constantly how we should act by adults, finding the in-between balance of loving both sides while dealing with all your other stuff AND SAVING THE MULTIVERSE FROM AN ENRAGED COW is incredibly difficult to write and I'm so glad they found the balance.

either way the universe forces a spiderman but because the spider is transported out of the 42 universe, neither happen allowing miles to become prowler",2023-06-02

"They seem to be wrong. The avoidance of canon events will perhaps wipe out the universe in question but it's not guaranteed. Miguel and the Spider Society use a flawed simulation system to try and predict potential disruptions that could cause the elimination of that universe. I think I get both sides, honestly. Miles understandably has severe qualms over condemning a life because you *think* that dimension will be taken out, but Miguel has the weight of the multiverse on his shoulders and can't allow himself to risk billions, if not trillions of lives to save a single one.",2023-06-02
"We don't know but I think we know. Aaron is dropping off a stack of cash. Jeff was talking in his speech about how Aaron and he were running a business.

Aaron we saw from MCU was a criminal. Miles in this one was a stone cold antagonist setting up for villain. It's too strong a thematic parallel to have him running as evil miles and likely on or leading the Sinister 6 Cartel mentioned in the background reel for JJJ.

I'd place a pretty large wager he's anti miles because Jeff died not Aaron.",2023-06-05

"Very interesting perspective, I appreciate the response! I agree knowing that it was a two parter kinda left me waiting for the cliffhanger and it didn’t hit quite as hard as I think it was supposed to. And I also agree that infinity war definitely left me with that feeling too despite knowing there was going to be two parts I guess? I think the ending to infinity war was almost too shocking for me to comprehend at first which is why it hit so much harder. But at the same time I revisit infinity war more often than I do endgame because much like I revisit empire more than i do jedi bc i think those movies really shine and stand on their own. Not saying ATSV can’t stand on its own bc it’s beautiful and the story is really good but I think, to get the full experience, it’s a movie that will ultimately have to be a double feature upon each rewatch. It feels like it’s leading to one big movie that just had to be cut in half.",2023-06-04

Tony was a huuuuuge canon event. More impactful than most. He's special.,2023-06-03
I'm not convinced about the universe ending if a cannon event is interrupted.

I don't think Miles saving his dad is going to effect nearly as much as they think it will.,2023-06-07

"As I understand it, the canon events are the things that happen to *every* Spider. Uncle Ben and Captain Stacy's deaths (or their equivalents for non-Peter Spideys) are canon events because they always happen, but the villains' fates are not multiversal constants so Peter, Peter and Peter saving Norman, Otto and Max from death and curing Flint and Dr. Connors shouldn't cause any issue.",2023-06-03

it should’ve ended there then. I would’ve loved seeing more of Miles as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The first film was about him becoming Spider-Man but this film didn’t really let us enjoy him being Spider-Man before being thrown out into all the multiverse shenanigans. I doubt the third film will focus much on this either. More of the HQ would’ve been cool too but I imagine they’re going back there eventually; but yeah this film would’ve worked better had it been cut shorter or made longer instead of ending right before the big fight.,2023-06-03

- All of this hinges on the current/upcoming live action movie characters (Venom, Morbius, Kraven, Julia Carpenter and Madam Web). 

- Gwen and gang help free Miles from miles-42

- Madam Web steps in and tells Miguel to stop trying to stop miles

- Madam web then goes on to explain how she's been working [in a way like OG Karn (master weaver)] to control the story of spiderman so that the story stays in tact and Spot is threatening that web.

- Kraven, Morbius, Spot, Miles-42, Venom, King Pin (maybe), and other venoms maybe form a new ""inheritors/sinister 6"" along with their variants to start killing spidermen across the multi-verse

- Miles, Peter B, Spider-Toby, Spider-Andrew, Spider-Tom, Spider-Sydney Sweeny (Julia Carpenter from Madam web), Gwen, Miguel, Hobie, and all variants fight across the multiverse back 

- Villains and Heros travel between different words fighting each other. Some worlds have mini cameos, some have longer scenes, blah blah blah. Maybe we even see Hobie meet cartoon Hobart Brown as prowler? (Would be cool if Spot could turn ppl into alternate versions of themselves)

- Eventually maybe Morbius (on some morlun energy), Venom or Miles-42 betray Spot (joining spiderman) and they beat him somehow

"That’s true, but bookends don’t change the over-arching story being that of Miles, and his story is widely left without any resolution and the movie doesn’t pace itself well at all to brace for that ending, 

The saga starts with Miles, and while we jump into Gwen’s temporarily in this film, we are still observing and given far more priority to Miles story who is also the forefront of all promotional material.

I’ve spoken with 2 others who had similar experiences at their screenings, fully engaged audience, and mood nosediving the moment the credits land followed by 15 mins of confused people watching credits and googling things on their phones.

All that said, I still think once the final part comes out, it’ll likely be a masterpiece as a cohesive trilogy.

I just think this is a terrible precedent to set of not explicitly noting the broken up parts while also building up the main story to a climax with no resolve to it so you can break the movie into two parts that can’t stand on their own at all.


It also felt a bit tone deaf to not include a bonus scene, as well as have the very villain centric credit sequence for a very quirky character who just obtained god powers in an age where meta humour and marvel are two peas in a pod.

As others have said, it is surprising that more spidermen aren't on miles' side. I expect by the end of the final film, many of them will be. He isn't an egotistical kid for crossing fate, he's just a human trying to do what's right.",2023-06-04
"\>>>but Miguel's model of the world doesn't reflect all the countless universes where spiderman DOES save his captain.

&#x200B;

Probably b/c those are universes where there is no canon event for the captain's death. 

Neither Miguel nor the movie says that the canon events are all clones of each other or the exact same thing. There are obviously deviations. Some of those deviations are going to be quite significant. maybe even significant enough to not involve characters and/or events we are familiar with...possibly even completely unrecognizable. 

Keep in mind, that our real life universe. Yes, us...you and me, are actually canonically in Marvel, and from the direction of the recent MCU along with this movie and Sony it's become obvious that what I just said is actually canon too, and we don't even have a Spiderman. LOL! Nor canon events. 

So yes, some universes just simply don't have the captain's death as a canon event. 

I mean even in the movie we see that Captain Singh is a person completely unrelated to Spiderman, and Gwen's canon event was neither her dad nor uncle ben but rather her Peter Parker. 

It's very easy to imagine that there's even greater differences that completely exclude the captain altogether.",2023-06-08
"> everyone here keeps downplaying the interference and disruption of the canon events

In their defense, Miguel is almost certainly wrong. 

Otherwise, one of either Earth 42 or Earth 1610 would need to be destroyed

Earth 42 because it never got its spiderman once the spot transported the spider to ""our"" Miles' world, or Earth 1610 when Miles interrupts the canon by getting his universe's ""rightful"" spiderman killed

I think what the movie is leading towards is them realizing miguel is wrong, maybe even malicious. Gwen realizes once her dad steps down as Captain and that not ""interrupting the canon"" and that's how she ends up recruiting the rest of them to join her",2023-06-08

"\>Who was the person who transported the spider to miles? Surely if we're going by cause and effect it would be Spot who actually causes the problems in the multiverse? 

wrong...badly. 

Spot was the created by Miles. He was the guy who got 'donutted' more or less in the last movie. 

Who, in turn, was created by the snowballed effects of a canon event. which just proves me right even more that when you disrupt canon events the law of unintended consequences starts kicking in and snowballs into **really** bad things. 

For example, that a villain is created from a **perfectly happy and law abiding citizen who had not a shred of evil fiber nor negativity in him** that is so dangerous that it threaten the entire infinite multiverse now. 

Canon events that do not go the way they are supposed to end up having **very** bad consequences in the long run. Even by your own admission Miles-42 becomes a supervillain instead of a superhero...that's actually even worse than if he had just never became anything but an ordinary civilian, lol! 

And right now Miles is going to disrupt another canon event all so he can save a **single fucking life** despite the fact that he sees right before him that Earth-42's NY is a hellscape that the likes of cartel gore videos on /r/nsfl__ can't even match up.

However, if that's the case and he's already infinitely massacring people then you've essentially reached ""the end"" so-to-speak and it means that you can't kill any MORE people. therefore, whether infinite amounts of people are dying via Miguel's logic or whether they are dying b/c all of the infinite multiverses suddenly die makes no difference. Since infinite = infinite. 

See? It's a rather uncomfortable and mind-exploding concept isn't it. 

I told you that you didn't want to go down this road.",2023-06-08
"Even if they had expanded and fleshed out Pavitrs story, I probably would not be able to relate to him. Pavitr is an Indian born Indian and I am an American of Indian parents living in a white society with other minorities. 

A person like Pavitr doesn’t understand what it’s like to try to get your parents to accept your white girlfriend like Miles and me. The cultural jokes only really resonates with the experience of Indians living in India and can be easily understood on a surface level by indians born and raised in America.",2023-06-02

"Yes, boomer",2023-06-17
"But Mumbattan did begin to collapse, you can say that its only partial collapse can be an indicator of hope or an indicator that Miguel's right, you can do the logical gymnastics to go either way.

Miguel's adamant about the severity of the situation *because* he incidentally contributes to the collapse of another universe.  His mistake and his experiences tells him he's substantiates what he tells Miles.  You can rationalize that Miles doesn't have to trust Miguel, but I don't want that perspective to remove Miles from an important and critical decision with so much at stake (including his own growth as a person).

Yeah I agree, but again I'd like the filmmakers, as well as us the audience, to really think about this dilemma on its own terms instead of speculating on whether characters are right or wrong on some details.  Miles doesn't know for a fact that saving his dad would destroy his world, he's holding onto hope that he can find some workaround to save both, but that necessitates him risking the existence of the world because he's clearly prioritizing his dad's safety over the notion that the universe would collapse.  Regardless of whether the others are right or wrong, he's making a moral decision right now, and moral decisions come with consequences regardless of which way you go.  My concern is that the film isn't going to give Miles those consequences.  Spider-Man as not only a character, but as an an idea is defined by loss, sacrifice, and perseverance.  The movie is clearly asking whether he should be, and I want the next film to actually give a prescriptive answer.  But I want the answer to be grounded and relatable, I don't want the movie to tell us that Spider-Man, and by proxy us in the real world, can have our cake and eat it too.",2023-06-02

Yes I have had platonic female friends. Having their toothbrush at your place and having them wear your shoes is not normal platonic behaviour, it was a clear misdirect. I see that now

Also I think Peter did get ""beta rolled"" what would your explanation for him resorting to turning to a lizard be? He was obviously bullied and saw Gwen as Spider Woman, regardless of whether there was romantic interest or not he got ""beta rolled"" and Gwens character helped facilitate that - he had no problem dying",2023-06-02

Next we have Mumbattan where Spot activates the collider. Yikes! Now they REALLY need to stop Spot, right?

Nope. Spot is barely mentioned any more. Now the priority is to keep Miles away from his planet (again, where he just was and Stacy was explicitly told not to do anything to him).",2023-06-03

Awful examples. None of those movies ended without resolving a plot thread. There is a difference between leaving room for a sequel and creating a two-part movie. This fell into neither category.

"This is also the reason Miles-42 has to hate Miles-1610, since it's implied the spider was about to bite him before it was taken through a portal

It's strongly implied that Miles-42 was going to become Spider-Man and save Jefferson from dying while Miles-1610 was likely to follow Aaron into a life of crime if the events of the first movie hadn't happened -- the portal caused their destinies to switch, and when Miles-42 finds out about this he's going to feel some type of way (cf. the show Counterpart starring JK Simmons)",2023-06-03

"But remember the buildings and people near the event started glitching like Miguel’s universe when his was destroyed.  Spot’s holes has never caused other universes to glitch out yet, and it’s not like the portal threw buildings and people from another universe to glitch out in Mumbattan.  There just seemed like a sudden energy wave that caused everyone to glitch out, similar to Miguel’s memory.  Plus the Quarantine Spider Team seemed experienced and knew what they were doing, and seems to have slowed the glitching.  

Also whatever Miguel’s tech used to predict canon events is *crazy* accurate.  It’s one thing to just say these are canon events by history, it’s another thing to say Miles’s dad will die in exactly two days from now from a multiversal villain.  Plus the Spot vision with both India Officer and Davis overlapping each other implies this is a sort of “fated” event, but that doesn’t really say what happens if you stop it.

Yeah Miguel is misinformed in something but personally I think it’s a very unsatisfying conclusion to just be, “Miles right Miguel and every other Spider person wrong”.  That would make every other Spider-Man TV show etc in the future be like, “why didn’t the Spider Society prevent their tragedies from happening?”  I feel it has to be more nuanced than that, and how they’re going to push that theme of, “Anyone can wear the mask” as this fated canon thing goes against it.  Also remember Peter B was present when Miguel’s universe collapsed so he agreed with Miguel’s conclusion after witnessing everything that happened.",2023-06-09

Me too; Scarlet Spider's design was always one of my faves. Maybe the writing was lame, but the 90's attitude is kind of infectious for some that don't mind the corniness, so I'd say it was less them ""mocking"" the character for being ""cringe and dated"" but more just poking fun at the inherent campiness.

(Miguel too immediately looked badass right when they revealed this movie, and Spider-Man 2099 was a 90's publication as well)",2023-06-05
"You are misremembering. Ben Reilly was no never cringe. He's story was sad and tragic, despite all the shit he got he still didn't stop being a hero.",2023-06-04
"Ben wasn’t really *that* 90s edge, it was more Kaine or 2099 that embodied that more.  He was basically just Peter but with different problems.",2023-06-04
I would say what did it was Miles saying he didn't remember him and that he was a low tier villain.,2023-06-10
"From the get go he considered himself Spider-Man's ""nemesis"", and assumed just mild teleportation would be enough. Then he got schooled and took it personally.

But once he realized his potential power he went full villain. Similar to Jaimie Fox (electro) pretty much going full ""crazed with power""",2023-06-25
"Sorry but swearing should not be an issue when it comes to children, period. The words aren't the issue, the reactions of outdated (almost exclusively American) people to them are. They also did it here and there in the movie you just saw, so...

As for sexual innuendos? Yeah, there's not so much of that, and since it's a natural part of being human I I don't see what the issue is, as long as nothing explicit is said/happens.

Marvel movies have gotten a bit more mature, some of them anyway, but they are indeed still targeted toward and appropriate for children of all ages.",2023-06-04

"She was more a few weeks ago.  These days?  

I can't continue to open myself to people.  It lets them in, and that's how I get hurt.",2023-06-03
"The difference is the environment people are raised in. In universe 42 Brooklyn is literally burning. The sinister six apparently runs a cartel and likely controls everything. When Mile's father dies he may feel there is no point going against the system that is in place. Especially when his uncle is a part of that system and influencing him. Therefore Miles joins said system in order to ""get his"".

Now if Mile's with powers loses his father, he knows he has the ability to fight against evil. He  would continue to fight crime in order to prevent more loss. Basically, their conviction to do good would become stronger.",2023-06-09
"I think the difference is the uncle event 

In 42 from what it seems, Dad Dies, uncle Aaron becomes the influence in life and the mentor and is “evil”, or at least morally not great. 


Uncle Aaron dies AND dad dies, there’s no bad influence really from uncle Aaron, no figure to influence. So I don’t think miles would be evil. 

It’s a combination of the two, the father dying, and then miles looking to his uncle, the other “father” figure for guidance, and Aaron’s influence not being a positive one that leads to prowler miles.",2023-06-11

There’s fuckery afoot",2023-06-03
"> Especially since the movies themselves are so optimistic that it's dealing with the countering pessimism of Miguel.

There are couple of reasons I'm unsure even Miguel is so cut and dry: 

(1) He refused to use deadly force on Vulture, even though this version of Vulture is one of the most dangerous we've seen.

(2) He's having his society try to capture Spot, not just let him murder people. Even during the chase scene, he's asking them to hunt him down. So I'm not fully convinced Miguel's decided he'll just let Spot massacre everyone. But he very much does not trust Miles to make the right decision if faced with a hard choice.",2023-06-04
"Canon isn't a red herring, it is the central challenge of the movies, the fate that they defy. 

Gwen already broke canon by baring her soul to her father, thus making him quit the force, thus saving him from tragic death.

It's important to note *how* Gwen saved her dad—not through heroism but by connecting with him and being honest. Both Gwen and Miles are fearful that their dads / families could never understand, and it's this fear and avoidance that leads to the tragic canon deaths in other universes. The very idea that honesty and oneness with those you love violate canon is the perverse logic the heroes reject.

The idea of canon events being necessary to shaping who Spider-People are will either be discovered to be outright false, or they'll come to the epiphany that *the outcomes of personal growth matter more than how they get there.*

""Spiderman and Gwen fall in love and Gwen dies"" is canon, and it will be broken in Beyond the Spider-Verse. They'll break canon first with something like Miles connecting with his family and Jeff survives, see that it turns out okay, and therefore decide to take a chance on love knowing that their fate isn't sealed.

The theme of defying canon are in the title: *Beyond* the Spider-Verse. Our heroes will no longer be bound by the ""rules"" Miguel enforces.",2023-06-17
"There might be a part where the Canon point falls apart a little bit. If Miles is himself an anomaly and therefore a disruption of a Canon Event, then why would he have to adhere to Canon Events in the first place?

I hope it doesn't happen but I can see it making sense",2023-06-06

He is on Gwen's team by the end so things probably aren't that bad, but a quick sight would have been nice, especially since these movies have such a great visual storytelling aspect to them.

There's something terrifying about Spot in that his power is simply 'you don't know where he's coming from next' and that's it. It's simple with an extremely broad range of applications - everything is a weapon, and I have loved that about the way he was animated in this film.",2023-06-03

Since Multiverse of Madness claimed MCU to be 616, whereas it had previously been designated 199999 as is referenced in Spider-Verse. (Spider-Verse also gives 616 designation to Peter B Parker. But if different people give different numbering systems, then comics could still adjust the numbers for Spider-Verse Peter, Miles, Gwen, etc.)

Thinking of this also just made me realize that the movie claims Miles is an anomaly, but also canonizes the PS4 games where Miles is a spider-person.",2023-06-02

"What's really either confusing or interesting is the fact that the any Prowler is there. Based on what we see in the *Across*, Miles from 1610 is the only Miles who becomes Spider-Man because of the multiversal spider, since Peter was the Spider-Person for that universe already. There's no suggestion that any other Miles becomes a superhero (though perhaps some become villains like in universe 42). It does seem that the Prowler exists independent of Miles being Spider-Man since Aaron was already Prowler before Miles gets bitten in 1610 and, though just as a thug and not as a costumed supervillian, in 199999. We of course don't know yet if the Donald Glover prowler in Miguel's custody is the one from 199999 but let's assume he is. It would be interesting to see conflict of 1610 Miles, 42 Miles, Miguel O'hara, and the Spot breaking the structure of ""canon"" events and starting a new cycle where a ""Miles"" coming into a Spider-Person's life is a canon event, starting with a spider biting 199999's Miles, attracted through the multiverse by the various Multiverse shenanigans happen in 199999/616.",2023-06-02

The characters being out of their universe in the first place already goes against what the movie set up — not all of them know Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Not all of them die, either.

"Yes, MCU Miles",2023-06-02
"My current thought is that at the end of “Beyond the Spiderverse”, this Miles will be pulled into the MCU as a live action character. Would make sense for two reasons:

- there will already be specifically established backstory for the character and emotional attachment to the audience because of it. (They also wont have to rehash the same origin story all over again)

- With it being rumored that Holland will be the lead in Avengers: Secret War, it would make sense for them to introduce a certain multiversal “wristwatch”. (Forgot the name they gave it in this movie)",2023-06-03

Man I felt they handled him pretty much perfectly up till the ending which I’m a little conflicted about. Making him into this weird foreigner was such a good treatment for him, and his underwater world was so beautifully crafted. I understand the criticisms and agree with some of them, but in the end the way they handled Boseman’s death was really well done.

I genuinely thought this entire movie would have involved Peter on the run, public perception ruined because of Mysterio. Vulture and Scorpion could have shown up, and perhaps Kraven the Hunter could be out to get him. I think that was the original plan (?).

Then perhaps as a side-effect of Slyvie killing HWR in Loki, you could have an indication of things to come, and end the movie with the villains from other worlds coming in here.

This is all speculation, but I was just wondering what the movie would have been if COVID hadn’t happened.",2023-06-05

"This timeline isn't 100% accurate - the conversations at Marvel editorial around introducing a black Spidey happened around 2008 when Obama became president.

Miles as a character was still in the looser design / iteration phase as his place in the world / his introduction were still being workshopped in 2010 when the Donald Glover Spidey campaign was happening, and they ended up drawing a lot of inspiration from him when designing Miles' final look because Brian Michael Bendis, who was writing Ultimate Spider-Man at the time, really loved the fan campaign.

So really the Glover Spidey campaign cropped up at just the right time to intersect with existing conversations and ended up influencing the final design of the character and became a sort of cultural touchstone for it. I don't think it'd be accurate to say that Miles exists as a reaction *to* the gatekeeping fans in 2010, but it'd definitely be fair to say he exists in *conversation* with a lot of the core complaints of the gatekeeping fans around diversity and representation in media since a lot of that was happening around the same time that those controversies were playing out in the media as our first black president was being elected.",2023-06-04

"I think the third act was a bit sloppy for me.

To co ready with Empire Strikes Back , that ended on a cliffhanger but you get Like having the big third act showdown with Vader and the team reuniting to give it a sense of finality.
With here you have Miles having his Dark Night of the Soul moment on the Elevator but then he instantly completes his arc when he drains Miguel and jumps off the Elevator

But then the film still has a half hour left.

So when Gwen wraps her arc and reunites with her Dad it feels disconnected because (at least for me) there wasn't a big ""showdown"" to sell it as her story wrapping

And then Miles has his ""I learned by Lesson"" moment with Rio but it feels disconnected due to the distance from the Elevator fight.

I personally would have re edited the Neuva York scenes so that there was a distinct moment where Miles 'lost' and then other moment where he does some self reflection to ""win"" as opposed to what happened where it was essentially one solid action set piece until the elevator climax.

I also would have added some more time to Gwen getting kicked out of the Spider Society.",2023-06-05

"Ooh that’s a good theory. They’re vigilantes, but they’re not as effective as Spider-Man would be. They think the Miles that waltzed in is a classic doppelgänger. The intimidation and “evil” look of them is because that’s the universe they’re in and the vigilante heroes they are. That’s definitely their direction.

I can see the reasoning behind this even more because they set up a lot of dominoes that need to be toppled over. They have Spot as a multiversal threat that needs to conclude and they have Miguel’s hunt for Miles that they need to conclude. If they write Miles-42 to be an actual villain then we’re beating a villain at the start of the movie, moving straight to Miguel after that, then moving straight to Spot after that.",2023-09-03

"The way I understood it is that the big issue is there are double spidermen in 1610, Peter gets killed before he can go through his cannon events then Miles started going through the canon events and would counteract the multiversal fragility. In 42 I think the spider was meant for Peter, not Miles. We see other Spider-People who aren't Peter Parker in the Spider corp but we don't see a single other Miles Morales as far as I could tell. I think there are many universe without a Spider-Person but if theres **is** a Spider-Person they follow a set of canon events. If those events are altered from someone  or knowledge from another universe, that's when reality starts to crumble. 42 got dark and ""messed up"" because there was no Spider-Man but it's reality didn't start to unravel because there was no alteration of Spider-Man's canon events (b/c there was no Spider-Man). 

I don't know if Miguel's prediction system is flawed but I think the was he dealt with Miles definitely was. He could have done a couple things: 1. Just send Miles back to 1610 and let his Dad die. Tell him he did a good job helping in Mumbattan and that he'd give him a call when they need help with spot. When Miles dad is dead that universe is good and he can say he's sorry that happened, there was nothing they could do.",2023-06-02

I rewatched the movie and the scene where spot is talking about how he took the spider 42 from earth-42, it shows the spider hanging directly over Miles-42 (anti-miles).

"I'll try be brief.

I thought everything about it was so arbitrary and that basically nothing is accomplished in its ridiculously long runtime. I love Jackie Chan films but if Police Story was three hours long I'd probably have a different opinion on it.

I felt like none of the attention to detail from the first film has carried over for the sequels but they at least had some memorable stunts, yet somehow this fourth one does more while none of it leaving any impression. 

The John Wick sequels have always been pushing the limits of credibility but it feels like it's fully jumped the shark with a magical blind man with perfect aim, magic bulletproof tuxedos, and a magic pistol that reloads quicker. It's just stupid and cartoony in a way that is not endearing to me, especially while it's trying to be super slick and ultra cool.

It's not that the action scenes are weightless but it's all so rehearsed that it looks like a dance and never a struggle. John Wick is rarely dispatching foes with creative efficiency anymore but instead often going for obtuse judo grappling and rolling them around.

I've thought that the deeper and deeper into the assassin world we've gotten, the more it's all felt like it was made up on the spot. The first film is a tight, slickly choreographed revenge film and the sequels are not that at all. They're written by a stuntman and it shows.

If Disney says their franchise's main universe is named Earth-616, then it's Earth-616. They're not gonna let another studio decide what universe number their films and shows take place in. 

Miguel said Earth-199999 because, in the Spider-Verse movies, Peter B. already hails from Earth-616 (even if that was changed to ""Earth-616B"" for this movie specifically). It's simply that, in the Spider-Verse franchise (and the comics), the events of the MCU happen on Earth-199999. But that has no bearing on where Disney decides to place their own franchise's main universe, which is Earth-616.

Also note that despite changing Peter B.'s Earth number from the first movie into ""616B"", the other Earth numbers in the film are kept the same as their comic counterparts (Gwen's Earth-65, Miles' Earth-1610, Miguel's Earth-928, Pavitr's Earth-50101, for example) with no additional letters to differentiate them.",2023-06-05

He legitimately has not won a single fight, by himself, other than thugs one time this run. Im not joking. He got his ass kicked by Vulture because Vulture was extra angry that day and Norman Osborn had to save him.

You're right Uncle Aaron and Mile's relationship felt strong. Certainly it was shown that they care for each other greatly.

"Miles's Earth (Earth-1610) did have a spider. It bit his Earth's Peter Parker. We and Miles watched him die in the beginning of Into the Spider-Verse. He wasn't supposed to die.

The collider that Kingpin and Doc Ock built brought the spider from Earth-42 over to 1610, in one of the test. Earth-42 doesn't have a Spider-Person because of this.

That anomalous spider bit Miles, which led to him being present at the fight that 1610 Peter died in.

Well there’s evidence (all other worlds crumbling after facing the same actions) vs hypothesis (thinking you can change this). Putting your world at risk to test your hypothesis is twisted.,2023-06-04
"That's the thing though. Neither Miguel nor the movie says or implies that one disruption is all that's necessary to give an eventual result of universe destruction. 

In fact, nothing at all even **tries** to quantify what is needed to eventually destroy a universe. Only that when you do disrupt a canon event it **may** eventually snowball into a universe's destruction and that, secondly and most importantly, doing **enough** disruptions **will** destroy a universe. 

I think of it this way. It's like repeated exposure to radiation of unknown type/quantity. 

Everytime you take a hit of exposure you may or may not have taken a fatal dose, but you keep on doing this and eventually you reach the limit of what your body can tolerate. 

Some bodies can tolerate an abuse the likes of which the most sadistic of nazis can't torture out...others will drop dead at the first one. 

Same thing with the universes. Maybe Universe so-and-so has a nice, big tolerance for canon events going haywire all the time, but considering just how many universes there are it's undoubtedly going to get to the point where you find a universe that can't even handle a single one going wrong. 

Miguel's mission, even as strict as  it may be, is basically that we can't take **any** chances...**at all**.",2023-06-09

"I agree with this opinion the most and pretty much sums up my issues with the movie. As a classic spiderman fan and comic reader the 1st act was great but as soon as Miles starts universe hopping it becomes no logical and becomes the Easter egg movie. Spider verse is probably the close we are going to get to the intial interaction of Ultimate Miles on a large scale. The Gwen stuff was great and relatively close to the comic origin.

This movie has the same human aspect of the characters that I enjoyed in the TASM movies. This movie tries to include everyone and it just doesn't work. Endgame was praised when it came out because of movie hype it's no different here. It's just the way most people enjoy media now a days. I'm not saying the movie was bad just painfully average. Most people like the guy that talked about there being nothing like it is just wrong. This isn't even the 1st multiverse movie on this scale. It's popular because Spiderman name is on it. This movie wants to be Miles & his amazing friends instead of being like the 1st movie mainly focusing on miles. The ending is playing on a group of spider people and it just doesn't work because we all know they can't all be fleshed out in 1 film. The main 3 from 1 worked this does not when almost every 10 minutes it's introducing new characters to the audience to what feels like to sell toys. I'm watching spider verse for miles and to some extent Gwen & Peter B. Everyone else is extra.

TLDR: NWH handled the multiverse stuff much better than this & Because this movie wanted to do that it took away from Miles & his family along with spot. Visuals & score can only take you so far. in a few months everyone will be out of the honey moon phase because this is many 1st exposure to the spider verse. Hell most people probably don't even know Madam Web. But this is just as much as a spectacle as endgame following the same beats practically. But I'd rather watch this than endgame tbh. Unfortunately for me this was nothing new as a spiderman fan or fiction fan in general.",2023-06-05
"TF? Spot literally says he 'created spiderman' by transporting the spider from 42. He explicitly states that, in the film. Go watch it again, he says it when they arrive at the broken supercollider. 

Are you seriously saying Spot was somehow a 'law-abiding citizen' before he became the spot? He worked for the bad guys in the first film! He became the spot as an unlucky consequence of his actions.

Your entire grasp of what is a canon event is so warped from what even Miguel explains in the film. There is no '""long-run"" for a canon violation, it has a very visceral and noticeable impact when you change one. Miles' universe not crumbling is a sign that Miguel's explanation is wrong. 

And no, I said they swapped destinies. Miles would've become the prowler had it not been for the spider. When he first meets Spiderman in the first film his spider-sense changes from the prowlers purple-green colour scheme spiderman's red-blue. So it was either or.

You're still doing it by the way, still trying to headcanon a way into making Miles be the villain here while criticising the directors at the same time. I'm clearly responding to a child here so I'm not gonna bother wasting my time anymore.",2023-06-08
"I understand infinity. Don't condescend to me, I'm enjoying discussing the moral dilemma of this movie with you.

I agree that infinity people dying one at a time or because the multiverse is destroyed is the same amount of dead people (infinite) but... those are both bad scenarios and should be avoided. I'm not supporting Miles destroying a universe by saving his dad; I'm supporting his attempt to save his dad *and* his universe. The only party that wants to let infinity people die is Miguel.",2023-06-08
"Yeah that's fair, and I agree with that too. You bring up some good points about the differences between Indians and Indian-Americans, which can be expanded into a whole total other convo about what representation looks like and how specific it should get and that's really interesting!

There's a lot in Miles story we can relate to as American born Indians which is super cool. And at the same time even if Pavitr's story wouldn't be relatable if it were fleshed out I still enjoyed seeing Spider-Man India and Mumbattan on the big screen! Lot to love from the movie",2023-06-02

"i mean tbh he’s kind of on edge when he meets miles and yells at gwen and him that because of them he’s been having to go into every universe and fix things up. he blamed their kingpin collider event for disrupting the multiverse and having a whole bunch of anomalies appearing everywhere… so it seems like he’s already being tasked to jump into the infinite multiverse to keep order of things. he was given this power, it’s his responsibility.. you can see that he’s pretty stressed out",2023-06-03
"My point was that just because Miles already had a canon event doesn't mean he couldn't have more, as the other Spidermen have had several. The hole in Miguel's theory is likely what will be explored in the third movie, that because Miles is an anomaly already, he doesn't adhere to the canon like other Spiderman universes. His universe's spiderman died because of him, which caused the events of the first movie. Since then, he has already positively altered one Spiderman's universe and 'negatively' altered Pav's due to disrupting canon.

I'm guessing the ending will be multiple anti-canon events for a normal spiderman, with Gwen surviving, his dad living, and his universe remaining in tact. But until the movie or reading a comic it may or may not follow, we dont know.",2023-06-06
"No, I don't think I will.  This film could have been better, if the film's writers didn't make Miguel into their mouthpiece about people rejecting Miles.  So, I think I'll stay at home, instead, and read classic 80s Spider-Man comics on my computer.  And occasionally post more things that would upset the writers of this film.",2023-06-04
"Noo that was penny Parker from ITSV, the blue avatar girl was on the right of the roof next to Pavitr Prabhaka",2023-06-19
"My issue here is largely in the way those consequences were presented to Miles: specifically, by a biased source, who Miles (nor the audience) have any reason to trust implicitly. Miguel didn't destroy a universe by saving an Uncle Ben; he destroyed a universe by replacing someone who'd already died (assuming that he did destroy the universe and wasn't just at ground zero when some villain made a mistake). Mumbattan's partial collapse could easily, and most likely, be the result of the multiversal, sentient hole that just tore its way back into 1610. And Gwen's dad quit the force, eliminating his canon death as a friendly cop, but her universe is just fine when she leaves it. Granted, Miles doesn't know that last one, but the other two alone are reason enough for him to not drink the Kool Aid immediately.

I also don't ascribe to the idea that Spiderman's character is defined by loss and sacrifice; to me, his perseverance is his main, identifying trait. Sometimes, that manifests in his ability to push forward despite losses, sure. But, more importantly, it's his refusal to ever give up or accept that he can't accomplish something. He'll always *try* to save everyone, even if he ultimately can't. So, asking Miles to *let* his father die goes against what defines Spiderman; Miguel is asking him to allow someone to be killed. And no Spiderman would ever do that.

It's relatively easy for the other Spiderpeople to cosign this, because their losses *already happened.* Believing that your failures were preordained probably goes a long way to alleviating some of the guilt they all have to carry everyday. But, even then, they all still got to *try.* And they're demanding that Miles just...give up. Which, if he did do that, would prove that he really wasn't meant to be a Spiderman at all.",2023-06-02
"I'm not really concerned with destiny in the situation presented, more so Miles's growth and the consequences he would be facing.",2023-06-02
"I'm assuming then that would have been the backstory behind the Earth-42 Miles had everything gone accordingly? And so then the main Miles that the Spider-Verse movies focus on really is an anomaly?

Dude, Gwen has a strict morals. She's not selfish, if she was, she wouldn't be a spider person. If she couldn't hand stress or manage herself. 

She is always portrayed as a sweet, calm, professional and caring character. 

And yes, I've have female friends over who ""forgot""  things after a stay or left stuff for safekeeping. Like keys and stuff, it dosen't mean anything, Like someone said, do you think an Anarchist would pick a hotel for his friend? 

She considers their feeling and keeps em at bay or clears stuff up. 

If its any comfort, the whole movie is her avoid all meta shit Miguel introduced.

[When it was first advertised, they even announced them as parts 1 and 2,](https://youtu.be/hnBzcLQUhYQ) but switched the names later to make the three names (Into, Across, and Beyond) sound nicer when watched in the future.

"He’s not a “bad guy.” Spider-Man’s entire arc is about using his power selfishly (all the way back to Tobey, animated universe in the 90s, and comics before then) and suffering the long term consequences. Adopting the core value of “self sacrifice for the greater good.” Notice how all of them except the anomaly (this universe’s Miles) agree with him on a philosophical level, albeit disagreeing with how harsh he is being on Miles (who didn’t ask for this). 

We relate to Miles, we’ve been over his shoulder for two films, his family, his struggles, etc. so we want him to succeed. So whenever something opposes him, especially an angry, giant looming brute we reflexively oppose him. If you listen though, Miguel explains as much that the problem is that if he “breaks canon” entire universes collapse and could take others with it, if not the entire web. It’s a risk he won’t take because he and the others are all past the point where trying to have it all has cost them. It’s not that he doesn’t care about Miles’ dad or the pain of the loss, but that they believe it is a necessity or reality itself is at risk. Quite to the contrary, they make it a point to show that he’s wracked with guilt and haunted by his decisions.  

Miles is unique in that he uses his outside the box (anomalous thinking if you will) approach to “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” is to “bring two cakes.” Will he pull it off? Or will he smash up both cakes like he did bringing them to the party? The theme is all but spoon fed to you. 

Even when Miguel has Miles pinned to the train and he’s at his angriest, he’s still just trying to stop Miles when, let’s be real, he could have ripped him apart as easily as her tore that train up. He’s not a bad guy, he’s just trying to do what he thinks is the greater good rather than having a multiverse uncle Ben event.

"I don't specifically know about that. 

Marvel has been more than willing on a number of characters to allow them to grow and change quite a bit. The issue with Spiderman is we can literally trace it to the editor Joe Quesada who has said his decisions were to ""maintain Spiderman's roots."" Quesada then moved to head of Marvel editorial in general.

The problem is Quesada feels Spiderman being down and out all the time in his 20s is a ""core"" part of the character in the same way a lot of Superman fans don't particularly like Superman being dark or going into grey, anti-hero territory. In this case the Superman fans are 100% right (Superman is and will always be about hope and making a positive change on the world). But Quesada on Spiderman is wrong: Spiderman isn't about tragedy, its about moving on and growing from the the major events in your life that shape you.",2023-06-05
"Yeah people are really going the “easy” route. 

What Miguel is saying isn’t necessarily wrong, but it’s because, from a certain perspective, he’s given up. The idea being that Spider-Man will always try to do “both” (like Pavil was going to) but they typically fail, and because of his particular failure having catastrophic ramifications, Miguel no longer even believes in trying to do both. 

People are way too harsh on him, which is an obvious outcome because people are gonna side with the protagonist over the character that disagrees/is opposing him.

Miles is, “ironically”, remaining true to the core of Spider-Man because his anomalous nature has allowed him to be kept out of the “canon” of Spider-Man so he hasn’t become jaded to the consequences of trying to eat your cake and have it too, but like someone else in the thread mentioned, it’s not as easy as “just get two cakes” as we see in the beginning of the movie where Miles DOES get two cakes and both end up ruined.

If they go with canon points not being consequential, that doesn't explain why Mumbatten started to collapse. Perhaps Miguel isn't as much of a well intentioned character as we are led to believe? Maybe *he* is the one destroying universes to try to make every Spider-Man go through tragedy (aka making sure everyone has the canon points that he wants them to have). Something that supports this is the fact that he needs to gather spiders to bite him often which implies he isn't a real Spider-Man to me.",2023-06-03

Part of the job is that they can't save everyone, no one is arguing that. But these Spider-people don't even try and have resolved themselves to let people die. That's Miles' issue. That's why before he teleports he says ""We're supposed to be the good guys.""

Definitely. He likes to think he's the most level-headed of the Spiders but he's the most unstable and emotionally compromised.

2) In contrast, Gwen's universe seems fine despite the event being seemingly averted in her universe. Her dad quit the force and is no longer a police captain.

"Tbh, strong disagree. The movie focuses very heavily on the personal relationships of Miles and Gwen. Gwen's arc is almost exclusively driven by this, and Miles' arc isn't ""I have to save the multiverse!"", his arc is ""I have to save my dad!"".

As far as the ending, the ending wraps up with 2 main notes: Gwen reconciling with her father, and Miles seeing Uncle Aaron again, followed by a version of himself who lost his father. It's completely rooted in and driven by the grounded, inter-personal relationships, not some cosmic thing the way Endgame was.

I certainly am not going to tell anyone they are wrong not to like the movie, art is subjective, but I do think that the complaint that the movie doesn't invest in Miles and his relationships enough is straight-up wrong. They drive everything he does and everything that happens, and they remain the main stakes throughout the film (shifting first from his relationship with Gwen as the main stake to the life of his father).",2023-06-05

Also, that's just the problem with Miles. He's at a fork in the road and it's either choose one or choose the other, but you can't have both. 

This is exactly why people like you need to stop being coddled. Either by Hollywood or the people in your life, b/c you evidently don't realize that sometimes there's no good way out of things and all solutions actually kinda suck and there's going to be some amount of sacrifice or pain regardless of what you do. You just have to determine which one was do the least damage and give the most good in return.

"I like that those consequences were presented to Miles by a biased source.  In the case of Miguel, his decision making is both emotional and logical.  Lyla's provided a model (the logic) to Miguel of how the this multiverse operates, and Miguel's experience and failures (the emotion) substantiates that understanding of the multiverse.  So yeah, he is biased, but that's real.  We're surrounded almost entirely by biased sources of information.  Miles working off of real but incomplete information is real and important.

I agree with regards to always trying for Spider-Man.  But that effort and perseverance is only meaningful in the face of failure and having failed.  With regards to Gwen, I already wrote in my initial post that she's implied to have already understood and accepted the necessity of her dad's death.  Her realization later in the film that he avoided inevitable death doesn't diminish her strength in character to push through that sacrifice and still try to do the right thing.

I understand that you're empathizing deeply with Miles's feelings and decision making, and it feels like you're reacting to my post as if I'm saying Miles is ""doing the wrong thing"".  That's not my position nor my point.  My point is that Miles, the character, is given a moral dilemma that is very meaningful and important to think about, it's one that's pretty fundamental to how we've engaged with the idea of Spider-Man for decades.  It'd just be a shame to make everything work out without lasting consequences regardless of which moral position the filmmakers and writers decide to take.",2023-06-03

For instance at the start of the film she plays the drums on her own, the rest of the band tries to reason with her and lets her know she is not making any effort to meet her half way and as soon as she gets to the beginning of the conversation she leaves instantly and rudely

Miles parents are very sceptical of her. Now that can just mean they would do that to every girl, but my guess is that might not be the case

When Miles swings through the city he often has fun light hearted conversations with the people, Gwen not only doesn't talk to anyone but she uses her webs on civilians, try to think of a time Miles ever webs a civilian

Her choice to see Miles knowing that the meeting could mess up the multiverse is selfish as is leaving him out of the loop which leads to the canon problem

She waits for other characters to approach or make the first move and when she has made a clear mistake she gets defensive in contrast to Miles who faces his problems head on and often is the character to start conversations with others

I get she is a teenager, but selfishness is selfishness - No she doesn't want to betray Miles...Jesus when did I ever say this? But she obviously does when only taking into consideration how she feels

Showing him and Miles staring at each other isn’t just a sweet moment, it totally works as foreshadowing that a Miles can be a Prowler somewhere in the multiverse - and even if it was initially accidental, I’m sure this wasn’t lost on the filmmakers by the time they got to shooting and animating.",2023-06-06

">I don’t really buy that, I think that anyone that could be spider man is like, inherently a good egg. 

Spiderpeople being corrupted isn't something new to the character. Mile's falling off the path out of desperation isn't that far out there. I also think he's fully capable of being redeemed.

>Also, I would be careful of falling into the trap of assuming things are the same in this world; that Jefferson’s death wouldn’t have been something that changed Aaron into being a better person as well. Or whether he was ever a hardened criminal in this world. 

Nothing so far has indicated that Aaron is any different. He has excess money, talks to Miles about a ""security"" job and immediately ties up and intimidates him. Until shown otherwise, there is no reason to believe he's good. It's very likely he passed on the Prowler mantle to Miles in universe 42.

>But even if this Miles is a villain, he’s not evil. Doing shady stuff? Certainly. But I don’t think this dude is out killing people.

I agree. I personally think he'll come around to the good side in the third movie.

Even crazier theory: maybe Miguel is projecting by saying that Miles is the greatest anomaly. Miguel is secretly the greatest threat to the canon. He lied about the universe he acted as a replacement in collapsing, but he realized that the only way for him to have enough wiggle room to maintain his pocket dimension was to make sure that all the other universes were perfectly aligned.

Whereas Universe 1610 had a Spider-Man and his being bitten directly led to the death of his universe's original Spider-Man. in either path though Miles-1610 was never going to end up as the Prowler.

"spider punk: The Fight: What does it mean and where does it come from? An Essay:  
Homosapien. A man. He is alone in the universe. spidermen. Still a man. He is alone in the universe, but he connects. How? They hit each other. Ooh! No clearer way to evaluate whether or not you're alive. Now, complications. A reason to fight. Somebody different. Difference creates dispute. Dispute is a reason to fight. To fight is a reason to feel pain. Life is pain. So to fight with reason is to be alive with reason. Final analysis: To fight, a reason to live. Problems and Contradictions: I am a spider anarchist. I believe that there should be no rules, only chaos. Fighting appears to be chaos and when we slam in the pit a show it is. But when we fight for a reason, like rednecks, there's a system. We fight for what we stand for, chaos, but fighting is a structure, to establish power, power is government and government is not anarchy. Government is war and war is fighting. The circle goes like this: our redneck skirmishes are cheap perversions of conventional warfare. War implies extreme government because wars are fought to enforce rules or ideals, even freedom. But other people's ideals forced on someone else, even if it is something like freedom, is still a rule; not anarchy. This contradiction was becoming clear to me in the fall of '85. Even as early as my first party, ""Why did I love to fight?"" I framed it, but still, I don't understand it. It goes against my beliefs as a true anarchist. But there it was. Competition, fighting, capitalism, government, THE SYSTEM. That's what we did. It's what we always did. Rednecks kicked the shit out of punks, punks kicked the shit out of mods, mods kicked the shit out of skinheads, skinheads took out the heavy metal guys, and the heavy metal guys beat the living shit out of new wavers and the new wavers didn't do anything.

"Regardless he has a point and is technically right. In theory what you’re talking about could work but a society like that wouldn’t work in the long term nor would in thrive. Anarchy in and of itself doesn’t thrive. The Spider-Punk himself basically acknowledges this “I don’t like consistency” Major problem with his ideology is that by standing against everything you also in a way stand for nothing. Instead it comes off as you standing for whatever a moment in time in history is considered the underdog. Which is not entirely bad some of the best moments in history are moments when the underdog rise. Haitians against the French, The Civil Rights Movement, and what happened to the Jews against the Nazi’s and their freedom, and so much more. But what after that? You still need a thriving society that stands for something. Something more than just standing against everything. 

Regarding the movie and its message and it’s antagonist (Migual) Yea his methods and cruel and obviously the movie is gonna show a message with him being in the wrong but, if it hadn’t been him it would have been someone else. Say what you want but his ideology created order and a home and a place for all Spider-Man’s to thrive and grow. This is way more than anything Spider-Punk would have or clearly would have ever done. The movie itself shows this because guess who is the one that founded the Spider-Verse? Miguel not Punk. Who found all the other Spidey’s? Miguel not Punk? Who’s trying to save more universe threw lW and order? Miguel not Punk.

As cool as Punk’s character is and me even appreciating the fact that he actually not only talked but walked the walk as well and wasn’t just Miguel’s lacy. People like him or people with the same ideology all have the same thing in common. And that is they don’t create anything.. They just criticize and teardown society’s the moment it has one flaw or mistake via anarchism that have been or are established. Who knows maybe their has to be a balance of things and that’s simply the way God (or whatever your belief is) aloud the Universe to work. Call it harsh but I have a hard time respecting anyone who doesn’t take themselves seriously and just goes around standing for nothing. Which is why S much as I enjoyed Punks character, the movie and the message it has. I came out respecting Miguel far more than anyone else possible only 2nd if not a tie to Miles.

In theory people would side with Joker based off a movie and would be against a rich dude who literally has access to everyone’s personal information beating up on the poor. But that’s not reality.

"To be honest though, I think it being a stretch fits in perfectly with the theme of these films.

We see a universe without Spider-Man, and it's pretty obvious that that universe was supposed to have the Miles Morales portrayal of the character, but Spot, Kingpin, and Doctor Octavia interfering led that universe's Spider-Man to go without powers. Being bitten by that spider is a *canon* event, but that universe didn’t get the memo. So why is it still around?

I'll tell you why. It's because Miguel is **wrong.**

He's grieving the loss he experienced and lashing out at the multiverse because of it. He's trying to hold the entire multiverse in a twisted version of the Sacred Timeline and he doesn't even realize it. He cannot accept any other outcome because he believes that the only way for Spider-Man to be the hero each universe needs is if they follow a strict progression of events. He has to believe it, because if he doesn't he'd have to accept the one thing he already knows.

That his loss is his own fault.

The man already had multiversal technology, so he must have known what would happen, but instead he came up with some tragic spin that allows him to deny any wrongdoing. That he never could have predicted that his actions would have the results they did, but he had the technology. He knew.

He caused an incursion.

Think about it, all these references to the MCU in this film. Especially to Doctor Strange specifically. There's no way Sony didn’t intend for us to draw a line from that oft talked about concept in Multiverse of Madness directly to what happened to Miguel.

And maybe we can take this further. Maybe the glitching is a symptom of an approaching incursion. One individual displaced from their reality who doesn't mesh with that reality. Acting like a magnet, drawing in their own reality until the two realities are occupying the same multiversal space. Attempting to coexist in a way that they weren't meant to do.

This would imply that Miguel's watches and wristbands are capable of turning off that pull, allowing a Spider to exist in that reality, but also preventing those realities from colliding.

----

Anyway, I think the idea of Tony being Holland's Police Captain being a stretch is exactly why Miguel is wrong. Because Miguel's mental state is rapidly deteriorating and he's seeing paranoid connections where they're not. And I feel like that's what is going to close out (or end, depending on what happens to him) his arc in the next film. He'll either realize the error of his ways and help Miles stop Spot, or he'll end up killed because he refuses to let go of his paranoid delusions.",2023-06-09
Either that or *Captain* America Steve Rogers,2023-06-04
"Because Miguel's wrong and Nexus Events are different.

Miguel's experiencing paranoid delusions about how the universe works and we know that because the biggest canon event of all, the spider biting Spider-Man, does not happen on Earth-42. You'd think that would cause that universe to unravel. You'd also think that Miles being a Spider-Man on 1601 would cause *his* universe to unravel, but it hasn't in either case. I think Miguel experienced an incursion and is in denial about it.

As for Nexus Events, they don't cause universes to unravel if they're disrupted, and in fact the TVA specifically controls Nexus Events to make sure they happen an extremely specific way. Not because the universe ends when they happen, but because a new universe is born if it doesn't happen in a very specific way. Disruption of Canon events causes that issue to get canceled. Very different.",2023-06-09
">1) We saw Pavitr Prabhakar's universe starting to collapse after Miles broke the canon event there. So there's some truth to the importance of canon events, unless we have another explanation for what needed to be contained in that scene.

I think a good explanation is that Spot's shenanigans are causing a breakdown of reality there. The Collider didn’t destroy Miles's universe a year ago, but it did threaten to and Spot is partially responsible for the machine's existence, so we have no idea what he did when he booted the thing up. 

>2) In contrast, Gwen's universe seems fine despite the event being seemingly averted in her universe. Her dad quit the force and is no longer a police captain. Unless another captain she's close to dies (who?) or her dad somehow still qualifies for the canon, her universe has broken that canon event seemingly without consequence.

I think a bigger contrast is the universes of both Miles. Miles has been an anomylous Spider-Man for over a year with no consequences to his universe. And Prowler Miles's universe missed out on the biggest Spider-Man Canon Event in that he was never bitten by his radioactive Spider, and thus there is no Spider-Man. Maybe the method of acquisition of powers isn't set in stone, but the acquisition of those powers definitely is.",2023-06-10

">Miles' arc isn't ""I have to save the multiverse!"", his arc is ""I have to save my dad!"".

His goal isn't this till the end of the movie roughly the last 20 minutes. Spot directly shows him this future when they travel to Mabhattan. Miles goal for a decent amount of the film is seeing his friends from the last movie and being a part of the new team. ""I have to save my dad!"" isn't his main focus until Miguel tells him he has 2 days to live. The wanting to be with the others was an excuse for him to jump to other universes. It wasn't even really to help Gwen. He just wanted a watch. Once he leaves after being unground the movie tone shifts from being about Miles and his family to Miles interacting with other spider ppl. 

NWH & Spider verse 1 still managed to focus on their respective main spiderman opposed to switching between. Gwen, Miles, Prauf, Miguel, then back to Miles. He's there yes but he isn't impacting the plot again until the end of Act 3.

>The movie focuses very heavily on the personal relationships

Most spiderman movies are focused on this front and center. This isn't the case the movie focuses on the spectacle just as endgame. The relationship at the beginning with Gwen and her peter worked because it allowed for context. When Captain Stacy finds out the plot rather have her jump into different universes than resolving the issue on screen. Gwen & Stacy's relationship being made up after a year of her being gone is unearned. Then she proceeded to leave again to get Miles back to his dimension. Miles has a better structure when it comes to his family because it leaves on a high not after he talks to his mom. Probably is the same as Gwen opposed to confronting his issues he goes to jump in other universes. Uncle Aaron arc was complete in the 1st movie bringing him back at the end does nothing besides showing it's a different universe. Yes miles hugs him obviously because he missed him but he this version of Aaron isn't the same leaving with that version isn't going to change any relationship dynamic not even with his mom. You said it yourself=

>followed by a version of himself who lost his father.

Which contradicts this statement =

>t's completely rooted in and driven by the grounded, inter-personal relationships, not some cosmic thing the way Endgame was.

The entire ending of the movie is cosmic stuff. Miles got bit by a inter diminsional spider. He attempts to go home yet ends up in alternate world where his dad died which how we don't know. This is no different than the avengers going back in time to get the infinity stones. Miles parents get closure at the end remind the viewer they are present. Instead of Miles going back to his actual universe and revealing himself to his mom and preparing to fight spot instead they rather take us to a timeline that will mean nothing by the end of trilogy simply because of tension and spectacle.  The movie 1st priority is the spider verse unlike the 1st the 2nd being the key part of a good Spider man film being humanization then 3rd being spot.",2023-06-05
"I get that infinity people dying is infinity no matter how it happens. It seems like you're suggesting I'd be okay with infinity people dying in the story if it happened a certain way. I wouldn't be.

It is a simple truth that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. That doesn't always mean submitting right away to whatever apparent option does the least harm. It can mean doing everything in your power to see if there is a better way. Then even if you fail you're at least sure you did the best possible thing.

I definitely don't think there will be no losses. I can see Gwen's dad stepping in and dying to save her, or Miles trying to sacrifice himself only for Earth-42 Miles to complete a redemption arc by taking his place, or the heroes changing Miguel's mind so he and the other geniuses in the Spider Society pool their brains and braun to figure out a solution that requires only Miguel to die. Heck, Across the Spider-Verse foreshadowed Gwen herself dying.

I certainly hope the writers think of something I haven't, whether or not anyone dies. Anyway, Miles might need to learn harsh reality but Miguel definitely needs to learn that life isn't all doom and gloom. Loom at him, the man is miserable and hasn't dealt with the loss of his loved ones well at all compared to the other Spider people. Like when Peter B. Parker says that without Uncle Ben dying, he wouldn't be Spider-Man. He's still sad about it but he's accepted it as a part of his past that made him who he is today. Miguel broods and seethes over his mistakes and losses by himself and his only friend is an AI he doesn't even like talking to. Something has to give him hope again, even if Miles also needs to learn that not everyone can make it out of a catastrophic choice alive.",2023-06-09
Ethinicity isn't dependant on the phenotype idiot,2023-06-06
"it’s a great dilemma to write because it brings upon validated reasons to be closed-minded and open-minded (closed to make sure events happen they are vs open to being aware of a tragedy and preventing it, and finding a way to fix everything). there’s also a clash of good vs good— 1 guy saw the tragedy that can happen if anomalies exist, the other guy sees a tragedy that’s about to happen and it’s his responsibility to save the person, not turn a blind eye on it. they’re both seeing their own tragedies and wanting to prevent them from happening, and we get a good vs good out of it. it’s really well-written.


speaking of good-writing,

miles says sometime early in the movie:
“i can have 2 cakes and eat them too.”


and it seems like the 2 cakes he can have and will be able to eat are: saving his dad + saving the multiverse (unfortunately, his foreshadowed 2 cakes did not end up being the ones for his dad’s promotion party, but the 2 cakes being his dad’s life and the fate of the multiverse are probably better tasting cakes anyway).",2023-06-03
"That's the choice others want Miles to make, but it's ultimately Miles's choice to make.  It's a difficult choice, one with no real strict moral answer.  It's the kind of stuff we face in the real world.  Have Miles get put through the ethical ringer and coming out with a strong conviction is what I want to see, but I want to see that choice made by his character and I want that choice to have real consequences just like ours do.  Giving him a way out where he can have his cake and eat it too betrays growth.

Edit:  Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man also explored this dilemma between Peter and multiple characters (specifically Aunt May and Ock), and the game took a stance and I loved the story for it.  Not because I agree with the moral position the developers made Peter take, but because it asked a meaningful and difficult moral question and it had Peter make a decision, and we got to experience that decision.  We get to internalize the challenge and this character's thought process, and we get to contrast it with our own as we contemplate the challenge for ourselves.",2023-06-03
"Wait how does this respond to the point of my initial post?  His monologue to his alternate mom is was him reflecting on his identity and the concept of ""fitting in"" or belonging to a community or to a set of expectations, and I loved it.  But it's not an answer to the moral dilemma the movie set him up with.  It's a great progress in character, but it's clearly not the lesson yet.",2023-06-03

"The issue is that so far we have only seen universes collapsing when *a visitor* breaks the canon. Miles by saving the father on the bridge that isn’t his, and Miguel for supplanting his alternate in a universe that isn’t his. 

There is nothing we’ve seen that is concrete that Miles saving his own dad in his own universe would break canon rather than just be him writing his own story. It’ll be definitely interesting to see where they go with this in the next film!",2023-06-04
"Yea, in that same scene Miles comes in and says “unless you bring two cakes.” It shows how he is trying to “do both.” The same as when during the canon event the Spider-Man holding the bus exclaims “I can do both” even though we know that he would have failed. 

The thematic argument seems to be “what makes Spider-Man who he is: the fact that he tragically fails “do both” or that he tries?” Is Miles right that they should try to figure out a way or is Miguel right that it’s too dangerous/selfish to try and risk breaking canon? 

I think this will be further explored since so far the only canon-event universe collapse we’ve seen are caused by “glitch”/anomalies in a universe they are visiting. One where Miles breaks canon in a universe he’s visiting, and one where Miguel also breaks a universe that isn’t his. There’s nothing concrete (so far) to suggest that Miles saving his own father in his own universe (writing his own story) would cause the universe to collapse.",2023-06-04
"Miguel first starting jumping universes after the Miles got his powers (ITSV Post-Credit confirms this) so Miles is still the earliest anomaly we know of (though I guess technically the spider that bit him was the anomaly first, only making Miles an anomaly after it bit him).",2023-06-15
"Also the subsequent dimensional incursions in the first movie had no real side-effects either, even though multiple spider-beings were absolutely interfering with """"""canon"""""" events",2023-06-12
"I don't think thats foreshadowing that he can't do both, I think it just foreshadows that he can't do both *by himself.*

Its been pretty clear through the entire movie that his parents are extremely supportive, and even giving him a lot of the benefit of the doubt when it comes to his unexplained behavior. Even when they see Gwen and clearly dont approve of her, they still choose to handle the situation pretty gently and accept that completely stopping him is not the right thing to do. Plus he seems to have established a working peer relationship with his dad while being spiderman, so he doesnt even have to resolve the issue of being seen as a criminal vigilante. His dad already accepts spiderman as being generally a force for good.

If he tells them the truth I imagine most of these problems will solve themselves. he wouldn't have ruined both cakes if his family knew he was spiderman, because he wouldn't be working so hard to deliver the cakes, be spiderman, and keep his identity secret all at the same time.

Also, low key im expecting after he tells them his parents will accept him as spiderman but also say he's still grounded other than spider emergencies.  


Edit: Gwens story highlights this. Things were going pretty well for Miles, he was involved in the community, has a confidant, and as mentioned before established a working relationship between spiderman and the police. Gwen on the other hand is isolated and alone, having an extremely hard time connecting to or being open with people around her, which is causing extreme difficulty for her. Things dont start to look up for her until joining the spider society. Along with the theme of miles 'writing his own story"", theres also a theme about opening up and connecting to others and working together instead of being a 'solo act' all the time. Even in miguels opening fight he tries to go solo until its clear this isn't working and calls for backup, and even LYLA knows this as she had already called before even Miguel was ready to admit he needed backup.",2023-06-14

If we didn’t know the Avengers were going to make a comeback and win for the out-of-universe reason that the good guys always win, Infinity War’s ending would have been fine as a true ending.

Meanwhile, this movie gives Gwen a fairly complete arc, which helps it feel like just as much of its own movie to me as ESB did. 

Who exactly do you think is Vader in this comparison? The closest thing to a Vader reveal in this movie is Miles realizing he was never supposed to be bitten, and like Luke, he deals with this problem before the movie ends.

"The important part wasn't that Gwen's dad quit persay. Yes he's now not the captain, but it's that Gwen grew. She took life lessons and opened up to her dad again.

Had she taken the Miguel path he'd have died either because she didn't grow or because she'd have let it happen.  Miguel has put everyone around him on a path to suffering because they're, rightfully, afraid of destroying universes. But the problem is they aren't growing or learning from anything they're just assuming it's all set and can only be on way.

Spiderman India had a line that sticks out.  ""I can do both,"" as he's trying to save the Captain and the bus with his girlfriend.  He's trying to be everything everywhere all at once. He can't.

Spiderpeople have limits and only by acknowledging them and reaching out asking for help can they change things and grow.  Miguel refuses to grow he's the embodiment of holding on so tight it all slips through your fingers.

There's also some very obvious issues with his theory. In some of the stories presented like McGuire and Garfield we never see a police Captain die.  We lose Uncle Ben sure, but there's no seen Canon event of a police Captain like Captain Stacey/Davis dying.

So by his own interpretation of the Canon those universes should have collapsed, but they didn't. Miguel is just too blinded by self hatred and regret to see he's wrong. He'd doing something good for bad reasons and getting it wrong in the process.",2023-06-05

There's one guy who might get the glory, but he alone didn't pick up the company and carry it upon his back across the finish line. Doing both the design work, the fabrication, and the base level research.

We do see some of this with Tony leaning on Jarvis in the first movie to find the right alloy mixes but that fell away and never got shown in the later movies.

So the idea that Miles seems to be pushing that while you can go it alone friends make the impossible possible is really where the story shines brightest.",2023-06-05

I also don’t love the thematic implications of the only reason this Miles is evil is because he didn’t have superpowers one year ago around the time his dad died (assuming the timelines are aligned with our Miles and the “major death” occurred at the same time).

I also don’t view superpowers to be any different to the techno weapons kit he has tooled out as Prowler. If he would’ve been a hero with superpowers, I think he would’ve been a hero with the expertise and intellect to create this tech. They seem, thematically, identical to me.",2023-06-10

"The first appearance was in Ultimate Fallout #4 (August 2011). S02E01 where Donald wears the Spider-Man Pj's aired September 23, 2010.

The concept of an African American Spider-Man was first discussed a few months before the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Marvel Comics' then-editor-in-chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst, ""When we were planning 'Ultimatum,' we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African-American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good look at one of our icons.""

Miles Morales was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli.[8][14] Bendis's thoughts about the character, and the way he looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African-American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in ""Anthropology 101"", the second-season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, ""He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book.""",2023-06-02

Glover is sadly too old to really do Spider-Man and especially miles these days,2023-06-05
"I really like that as a plot point. Miguel is set on the fact that miles was never meant to be a spider man because it was the universe 42 spider, completely missing that in universe 42 the spider was always going to bite miles. Meaning Morales had always had the potential to be a Spider-Man, it wasn’t some fluke. This would also explain why all other abnormalities glitch, but miles in his home universe doesn’t. All miles moraleses have the potential to be spider man, in any reality, so just because the powers came from another universe it isn’t really an abnormality because Miles is always potentially a spider man",2023-06-06

"As a follow up on their comment, and for anyone else interested in reading, Edge of Spider-Verse #2 (2014) specifically is Spider-Gwen's introduction with the others being spotlights on different multiversal variants, and that mini series leads into the first Spider-Verse event.  Funnily enough issues #1 and #5 are Spider-Man Noir and Peni Parker respectively, so reading the whole mini series might be appealing anyway.  For digital reading, Marvel Unlimited is probably the best option, or if you're into physical copies, the newest edition of the **Spider-Verse/Spider-Geddon** hardcover omnibus has both the events in a proper reading order (which was an unfortunate issue with the first Spider-Verse hardcover release).

As for Spider-Gwen's stand alone material, they got most of what's been released, but there are a couple more odds and ends to mention.  For simplicity's sake I'm just going to copy the listings from the two omnibuses which are fairly comprehensive (the first of which is sadly already out of print):

**Spider-Gwen Omnibus**
EDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE #2, SPIDER-GWEN (2015A) #1-5, SPIDER-GWEN (2015B) #1-34, SPIDER-GWEN ANNUAL #1, ALL-NEW WOLVERINE ANNUAL #1, SPIDER-WOMEN ALPHA and OMEGA, SILK (2015B) #7-8, SPIDER-WOMAN (2015) #6-7 and SPIDER-MAN (2016) #12-14

Note here that the annuals can probably be read whenever, the Spider-Women crossover mini-event is after the 2015B series issue #6 and involves Spider-Woman and Silk, and the Spider-Man issues (from the Miles Morales run) are a crossover starting after the 2015B series issue #15.

**Spider-Gwen: Ghost Spider Omnibus**
SPIDER-GWEN: GHOST-SPIDER #1-10, SPIDER-GEDDON: GHOST-SPIDER VIDEO COMIC, GHOST-SPIDER #1-10 and ANNUAL #1, KING IN BLACK: GWENOM VS. CARNAGE #1-3, WEB WARRIORS #1-11 and material from AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2015) #1

For this one, they're pretty much in order with the exception of Web Warriors, which is a spider-variant team series set nebulously, but sometime soon after the original Spider-Verse event.  The material from the Amazing Spider-Man issue is just a couple page ""prelude"" introducing it.

There are a few other cameos with other spider people during Nick Spencer's Amazing Spider-Man run, but those are more a tie-in to his story than Gwen.  Lastly, there have been two recent 5-issue mini series that did not come out in time to be collected yet, and those would be Spider-Gwen: Gwenverse, and Spider-Gwen: Shadow Clones, the latter of which has one issue left to publish.  Based on what I remember of Marvel Unlimited's publishing schedule, you should be able to read everything except the most recent mini-series digitally.",2023-06-16

">The Spider-Punk himself basically acknowledges this “I don’t like consistency”

Hobie had very little screentime and when he's not being used to help forward the plot by giving Miles advice, he's using it to, as all Spider-People do, crack jokes, only he does it through the lens of anarchism and/or anti-establishmentism. Using this one line to go ""eVeN tHe AnArChIsT kNoWs He'S a HyPoCrItE"" is stretching things to the point I have trouble taking you seriously.

>Major problem with his ideology is that by standing against everything you also in a way stand for nothing. Instead it comes off as you standing for whatever a moment in time in history is considered the underdog.

Just say you don't know what anarchism is, man, it'll save everyone time.

>if it hadn’t been him it would have been someone else.

And all the spiders were just following orders, right?

>Say what you want but his ideology created order and a home and a place for all Spider-Man’s to thrive and grow.

Clearly not, as we can see with the exclusion of Miles and the threat of exclusion and how much convincing it took to include Gwen. Miguel built a panopticon on the same level as Kang in Loki.

>This is way more than anything Spider-Punk would have or clearly would have ever done.

The act of building something is not in and of itself a good thing, but even aside from that, you're still wrong. The movie ends with Gwen literally building a team of spiders to save Miles, and that team included Hobie who can honestly be said to be a big part of the founding of that team considering how he helped Gwen after she was excommunicated.

>They just criticize and teardown society’s the moment it has one flaw or mistake via anarchism that have been or are established.

Again, you just don't know what anarchism is.

>I came out respecting Miguel far more than anyone else possible only 2nd if not a tie to Miles.

Then you didn't understand the point of the movie lmao. He's a sympathetic character, yes, but he is very clearly coded as a fascist. You probably also unironically say ""Thanos did nothing wrong.""

>In theory people would side with Joker based off a movie and would be against a rich dude who literally has access to everyone’s personal information beating up on the poor.

Remember when I said I have trouble taking you seriously? Yeah, we crossed that line where you're just being silly. The Joker isn't an anarchist. He stands for chaos and murdering anyone and everyone he wants to on whatever whim he has at the moment. Bruce Wayne is a problem with society in that he is a billionaire who obviously doesn't contribute as much as he could and Batman is a problem in that he lets insane serial killers like the Joker live assuming our broken judicial and carceral systems will actually do anything to fix the problem. Neither of these things being true mean that people think the Joker is the good guy, actually. Unless we're talking about the Joker in Harley Quinn who kind of seems to have been rehabilitated in a really weird way, but that's a comedy show.

>I’m reality we would want Batman to continue doing what he’s doin despite how harsh it is.

What reality, bro? This reality? The one where Batman is totally real? No the fuck I don't want Batman in this reality. I don't even want our current judicial and carceral system because it doesn't fix the problem. It's barely a bandaid over a gaping wound in society. Batman is more effective than real cops because he actually catches bad guys but even in fictional Gotham, he's only an attempt at treating symptoms rather than trying to solve the systemic problems in society.",2023-06-03

"Maybe, but I feel like theres some unreliable narration from Miguel here.  (yes LYLA is the one who says it, but presumably he made her and we don't know how long she's existed) Doesn't it seem a bit weird that he would have been able to  conceive of, design and construct the watch within a couple days of the original collider event? Also its been barely more than a year since the first movie, and he's supposed to have his tragic ""i replaced myself in another universe"" backstory AND the entire establishment of the spider society within that time?  


I mean, its a comic movie so all things are possible, but I wouldn't be surprised if he had some interdimensional shenanigans before the collider incident, and the collider incident is just what motivated him to become the 'protector of the multiverse'.  


Even if everything did actually happen after the collider event, Miguel effectively did the exact same thing that Kingpin was trying to do, which even the Peters Parker from the first movie knew would cause universe instability. So its likely that he's either wrong or lying about canon disruptions being the main cause of universe collapses. He's projecting his own failings on Miles. His own logic breaks down pretty quick when you realize that universe-42 not getting a spiderman already disrupts canon, and neither it or Miles' universe have shown to be at risk of collapse.",2023-06-15

1. Miles escaping from evil Miles
2. Gwen getting Miles back to his universe
3. Figuring out the mystery behind the sketchy character that is Miguel O'Hara (seriously. he doesn't seem like a real spiderman _and_ he has to get a new spider to bite him often)
4. Figuring out why Gwen's universe wasn't destroyed when her dad quit captain (three possibilities that I can see: he unquits, gwen bonds with Miles' dad and he dies, or canon events are a lie but Miguel for <insert evil reason> and Miguel intentionally started to destroy Mumbatten)
5. Probably another cool 10 minute fight scene with Miguel
6. Teaming up against spot. Includes saving Miles' dad (or failing to do so)
7. Doing something with the romantic tension between Miles and Gwen (this would probably happen right before the big act 3 battle I assume? but worked on all movie before the big breakthrough moment)

I mean if you rush it you could fit that all into maybe one and a half hours but at that point you need a new movie so another 2-2.5 hour movie is good to let the movie breathe.",2023-06-03

In fact you can go look it up it’s been well documented that Empire was originally supposed to end more like this film did, right as Luke got picked up by the falcon and with no closure.

They ended up deciding that audiences wouldn’t take to it, and went back to add in the ending sequences to let people know that, while yes there was more to come, this portion of the story was now over.

I don’t feel like that ever happens in Across. We just are in the middle of the plot and then “bam” it’s over all the sudden. You also *absolutely do not* see Miles “handle” anything to do with the Prowler, that is also cut off and not shown.",2023-06-02

>*Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that’s happened with her, I... Please.*

"> common-enough theory

I didn’t deny anything, I just noted that the theory does have solid-enough grounds to it for some people to believe it — and that while the writers originally intended for the MCU Peter to have had an (unmentioned) Uncle Ben, that they may have changed their mind by the end of things, based on their own comments on the matter. With all the focus on the multiverse, the concept of a Peter who became Spider-Man in spite of his uncle, rather than because of him, is an interesting-enough one.",2023-06-05
Oh yea,2023-06-13
">There's also some very obvious issues with his theory. In some of the stories presented like McGuire and Garfield we never see a police Captain die. We lose Uncle Ben sure, but there's no seen Canon event of a police Captain like Captain Stacey/Davis dying.

The thing is, Gwen’s arc had an end and Mile’s arc was still being expanded on as the credits rolled. Not hard for people to then default to “it’s Gwen’s movie”, it’s easier to do that and excuse the poor writing for Miles ending than it is to pick apart something they enjoyed.

I simply don’t agree about how it made me feel, but glad it landed for some.",2023-06-06
"So you're acknowledging that Gwen's character arc is complete, you're just saying it doesn't count.

Nobody's arguing there was no cliffhanger. Just that the movie clearly anticipated the ""half a movie"" complaints and gave us some significant closure with Gwen to make up for it. You can not appreciate it, but that's certainly what the movie was doing.",2023-06-05

Also I think you need to go watch the first movie again. His dad doesn’t just “say he loves him” the whole point of that scene was to parallel the speech that Peter usually gets from May after Ben passes. At least that’s what it screamed to me. Especially since it came right after Uncle Aaron’s death.

Edit: he also didnt “master webslinging” there are entire parts of that scene of him traveling through the city showing his inexperience (the one that jumps out to me off rip is he swings too low to the ground and has to come in running to get back into the air with momentum as well as a lot of his movement being jumping based rather than swinging).

"To be honest, I think that while Miguel isn't 100% right, he's still onto something with canon events. A dimension might be able to bend and accept some changes to the canon, like an author adjusting the plot after it goes in a direction they didn't quite expect. But bend it too much and the whole thing comes tumbling down. No Way Home was probably able to escape an incursion due to canon events being met and and the gang actively trying to fix all these multiversal beings, while Mumbatten was suffering from it in a matter of minutes due to Spots' influence and a flagrant violation of a canon event. 

>We were told in Multiverse of Madness that that's exactly what causes incursions - people being in the wrong universe for too long.

I'd argue it's not just that, it's also doing things that causes ripples in the canon. The more things you do or the more impactful they are, the bigger the ripples until they become waves, until they become tsunamis. The Stranges that caused incursions in MoM were either repeatedly and actively sabotaging other worlds by murdering those Stranges, or heavily implied to be doing stuff they shouldn't have. 

I was also rewatching Across the Spiderverse last night (using a shitty camrip that had popcorn munching ASMR, but that's besides the point), and I noticed that when Miguel was talking about the universe he destroyed, he was working with another Spiderman trying to save everyone as the dimension collapsed. Maybe it was Peter B. Parker due to the dialogue, but what if it was *that* universe's Spiderman? Like no wonder it all went to shit, he did more than just defy canon, he ripped the pen right out of the author's hand and tried to write the damn story himself.",2023-06-18

Agree to disagree,2023-06-06
"I agree with the last part. Any movie I see better have writing more clever than stuff I come off up with off the top of my head.

So I believe that if the multiverse is infinite, then Miguel letting one person die per universe is still letting infinite people die. If you mean to say that is still preferable to letting the universes die since that infinity (billions per universe) is greater than the other infinity (one per universe) then I understand that. I just see letting infinite people die after not trying very hard to think of ways to save everyone as a failure by a hero whose stated goal is saving as many people as possible.

And again, Miles is only wrong if we take it as an absolute fact when Miguel says there's no other way. Miguel, the guy who won't try anything else, won't let anyone else try, and who Spider-Punk doesn't trust. I bring up that last bit because every other character loves Spider-Punk and he helps Gwen and Miles, so I trust his judgement more than Miguel's. Miguel is unreliable.

Also, did the Indian Spider-Man's universe get destroyed? I know it came close but I think I remember them saving it, right? If not, the movie really glossed over that.",2023-06-09

There's a good chance that Miles would lose his dad even if he wasn't a Spiderman, and getting spider powers give Miles an advantage of the potential of saving him, which is what threatens canon. There was a good chance that Miles could've turned himself into a Prowler if Spiderman of his dimension failed to save the Police Captain (as this usually happens and Miles already became a Prowler in Earth-42 because his dad died), especially when the first time he had his Spider-sense near Peter of 1610, the color of spider-sense was purple and green (which are colors of Prowler) only to turn blue and red to match Spiderman, essentially re-writing Miles's destiny, and since there were one original Spiderman too many, one had to go, which explains while moments later after Peter-1610 discovers him, he immediately meets his demise.

Infinity War had an entire fleshed out final act where the protagonists lost. It stood on its own legs the day it was released and still stands on its own legs post Endgames release. 

The same *cannot* be said for ATSV. It has no resolution or conclusion.

Miguel has talons on his hands and feet, venomous fangs, accelerated vision that affords him different vision abilities, and organic webbing as he actually developed spinnerets in his arms. He also has permanent red eyes that are light sensitive. The only difference is the laser webs, but that could just be because the filmmakers thought “Spider-Man from the future” would look cool with lasers. And the injections seem weird.

And even then it’s mostly by his race/parents. This ending made me finally feel like miles was becoming his own distinct personality the way he never has in the comics or really even the first movie. Until now he could’ve been interchangeable from Peter Parker and the story wouldn’t be that different",2023-06-07
Nope. A work of art does exactly what it wants to. It’s not there to cater to entitled schmucks who throw a tantrum over a cliffhanger.,2023-06-02

"I find it almost impossible. I mean.. 10-month duration is too short just for pure animation works. And beyond will be released in 10 months.

I bet they got all in (voice/animation etc) and just editing: cutting stuff and some final render (taking from another angle etc). 

There might be additional voice acting, additional scenes added.. but main writing jobs are already done.

If there is a big ""story"" hole in the middle in the movie, i think safe to assume that BEYOND will be delayed for another year",2023-06-07
"> Miguel also owns what's left of Alchemax, right?

When did they say that?",2023-06-20
"So let's see:

- Beginning, Middle and End. Check, unless you really think it's impossible for a movie to be a two parter. And even if you don't, the first Spiderverse movie fully fits into that niche. 

- Themes, arcs, conflict, and enemies. All present. 

- Spiderverse explains itself well and is perfectly enjoyable for someone who isn't a fan of spiderman, but otherwise if you think that a movie literally can't be based on anything and has to be wholly original, you're joking yourself. Looking at the top 10 highest rated movies on IMDB, 8 of them are based on something else. 

- Saying ""cheap lazy stuff like the multiverse"" seems like it's just trying to avoid having to say real criticisms of the movie. There are tons of non-comicbook movies that use the concept of alternate realities and multiverses.

And seriously dude, Puss in Boots is reliant on a ton of stuff. It's a sequel to a spinoff of another series, which draws 90% of it's characters from fairytales and myth. Just from the recent movie:

- Puss in Boots himself

- The Big Bad Wolf

- Little Jack Horner

- Goldilocks and the Three Bears

Plus countless other references in Jacks collection. 

You're just gatekeeping the concept of cinema and making arbitrary exceptions for movies that you like.",2023-06-02
"Now that is the mystery. Comic-book Miguel had underwent gene therapy with spider DNA (by accident or by sabotage, depending on canon) and that's what turned him into Spider-Man of 2099. I don't think he ever needed to continually inject himself with a serum.",2023-06-06
I assume it was something to keep his vampyric powers in check.,2023-06-09
"Yea I just personally feel it was very poorly executed and the only excuse people can give it is “I’m excited for the next movie”.

Like, yea, that’s what any cliffhanger is meant to do. That doesn’t mean this one isn’t objectively messier than basically any other cliffhanger I’ve ever seen. Everyone wants to act like it’s “my opinion” but I have objective reason for why I feel this way.

Just feels like everyone wants to sweep it under the rug.",2023-06-29
"That I can respect, but it doesn’t mean the ending of this movie was better than the first. It just means it had a larger impact on you personally.

I’ll would sit here all night and argue with you why it objectively isn’t a comparison between the two, but that seems like it would be a waste of both of our time.

I don’t have any issue with your opinion and am glad that you got something out of the movie that I think it was sorely missing. Happy for you boss. Just simply am not in the same boat.",2023-06-07
"And art is worth nothing without someone to admire it. I simply don’t in this particular case of this particular film. Lot of good art, shit writing for an ending.",2023-06-02
"I have only a limited memory of the original 2099 comics run, but there was a point where Miguel actually became CEO of Alchemax. Idk how closely Spideverse is following the comics, but given how much money Miguel has at his disposal, I wouldn’t be surprised if he still owns Alchemax or some variation of it.",2023-06-21
">and is perfectly enjoyable for someone who isn't a fan of

Ah yes, I forgot this one. These streaming series have fanboys. Fans. A loyal base obsessed with it, with every.... episode. They want desesperately to call them ""movies"" because the main objective is to justify the childish obsession around a teen in spandex. TV is small, movies are big. TV comes out like machine gun bullets (Marvel), movies are a missile (James Cameron).",2023-06-03
"I mean yes objectively, on paper, the cliffhanger shouldn't really work. But that's not how we engage with art right? Everyone sees what their general reaction is towards the ending. Because the entirety of the film is really well done especially visually, people have been more open to the kind of haphazard ending it slapped onto the film",2023-06-30
"Maybe it is just my personal opinion, but I view these movies are character driven, so having an undefined main character is a glaring flaw to me. Into the spider verse is otherwise such a groundbreaking, incredible movie that in spite of that I couldn’t really fault it but I am so glad they finally made Miles a really unique character in this movie, and that deserves major props",2023-06-07
"Again. Your entitlement is only a reflection on you. Not the film, which is already a critical and commercial success. Grow up.",2023-06-02
So just gonna ignore every single thing I said to come up with something new?,2023-06-03
"Nah def not just your opinion, my best friend has been saying the exact same things to me for days. He also has been accepting the points I’m bringing as valid and agrees that the movie had an objectively shit ending

He said and I quote “I gave it a 10/10 not because I thought it was perfect but because it had a lasting emotional impact on me” and I respect that feeling. I just can’t respect using an objective scale or excusing things away as “perfect” when they simply aren’t. A lot of it just comes off as sensationalism to me and not genuine.",2023-06-07
"A lot of imperfect things have critical and commercial success. It’s ok to say it’s a good movie. I personally think it was a good movie. I just also personally think the ending was objectively handled like shit, I dont know why you’re taking it so personal",2023-06-02
"I don't do American Rethorics.

Yes. My position is that is TV in the big screen, like Hollywood serials from the 1930s were TV before TV was invented. In the cinema I was thinking, ""that looks like a big TV thing, it's the same screen, but I feel I should pause it to grab some chips and go back to this or that, or watch the next episode, and look, another superficial conversation, filler, I guess they need it for syndication, ah no, again, I'm in a cinema, uh"".",2023-06-03
">	 I just also personally thing the ending was objectively

Looks like some basic education alongside the growing up wouldn’t go amiss.",2023-06-02
You've made a ton of replies just to still be wrong.,2023-06-04
"People can have choice or differing opinions on which objective measures they use to evaluate things dumbass, educate yourself.",2023-06-02
Objectivity is not subjective. Saying you think something was objectively poor is a contradiction and just goes to reinforce that you’re either a kid or one huge signpost of how the whole “no child left behind” program failed.,2023-06-02
