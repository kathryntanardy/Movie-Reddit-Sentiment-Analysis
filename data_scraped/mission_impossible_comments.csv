Call it a hunch but I feel like Part Two is going to have Tom Cruise revisit his Rogue Nation stunt where he held his breath for a long time. Feel like that‚Äôs going to be a huge part of what happens in the submarine.,2023-07-12 02:27:34

"Overall a good addition but few things didn‚Äôt work for me
1) the effects of Rebecca‚Äôs death didn‚Äôt really seem to take a toll on a level I expected. Her character seemed more like an after thought throughout.
2) Gabriel‚Äôs history with Ethan didn‚Äôt really work for me, it felt like it was simply added on in the last minute to give him something. He is recurring character so perhaps he‚Äôll be better over the course of two films.
3) The editing was wonky during the train sequence.. they were cutting abruptly between the guys exposition and Tom‚Äôs bike ride. Could have had been more streamlined. 

Loved Atwell‚Äôs addition and the action was once again top notch. Watched it twice already and had a really good time.",2023-07-12 05:32:04

My biggest issue is Gabriel. I appreciate the attempt at fleshing out Ethan‚Äôs pre-MI days and why join the IMF, but giving me a 5 second grainy clip 7 movies in and saying here‚Äôs Ethans old nemesis, you should hate him too was rough.

"Anyone think it was a bit odd that at the end of this movie they have to travel underwater to an imploded sub, given the timing of the events that happened with OceanGate a couple weeks ago. The Entity knows all.",2023-07-12 14:37:32
"Holy shit Hayley Atwell is fucking gorgeous. I've also only seen Pom in Marvel but I think she did fantastic even with her limited lines.

The movie definitely needed more Gabriel and a little clearer motives. Does the entity just want to destroy the sub because it contains its only weakness? Why not have Gabriel immediately destroy the key when he found it? Why doesn't the AI just launch a few nukes at where the sub is? I highly doubt this god tier AI can't figure out where the sub that it hacked is located.

Also, Hayley Atwell's character is what Indiana Jones attempted to do with their untrustworthy British woman sidekick but they failed miserably compared to this movie.",2023-07-12 07:49:17
"Did anyone feel like this one pays significant homage to the first Mi film? 

Kitridge played a huge role. 

Masks were a major character (more than usual it felt) 

Train sequence 

Lots of close up claustrophobic shots 

70s thriller vibes 

I really need to see it again to fully process it",2023-07-12 02:43:32
"Yeah okay it's quite a good movie but I'm gonna be pretty upset about Ilsa's death for a while

Was it pretty heavily telegraphed by the trailers, and Gabriel's ultimatum between Ilsa and a character that was 100% going to be in the train scene, and the subtext in every interaction between Ilsa and Ethan, and Kittridge saying Ethan was gonna lose something while a giant picture of Ilsa's face looked over the conversation in the background?  Yes, but I was in denial.  She did get a great final fight and her death is layered enough for it to not technically be a fridging (she makes the choice to go save Grace and the predictability of that choice is thematically important) but it still felt like she was underutilized.  I think her last line was some offhand question to the White Widow in the club and then she doesn't say anything until her death.  She really doesn't say much the whole movie now that I think about it.  Even in Fallout when she was hiding a lot of the time you could really feel her presence.  And then they only mention her by name a couple of times in the following scene before she's kind of forgotten.  For the fourth character in the entire series to make it more than two movies in a row (Ethan, Luther, Benji) it felt like she deserved more, especially since she's McQuarrie's character and not a holdover from a previous director.  I suppose the effect it's having on me means it was an effective choice, though.  Those few scenes where she and Ethan were momentarily happy together were everything.  Still bitter.  I'm gonna sit over here and mourn for a while.

In other news, nice to see Shea Whigham step out of his comfort zone and play a well-meaning cop that becomes an obstacle for the main characters, haven't seen that for a few weeks.",2023-07-12 03:44:08

WHY ARE YOU TELLING SOMEONE ELSE TO SHOOT HER WHEN YOU LITERALLY ARE ALREADY AIMED WITH YOUR HAND ON THE TRIGGER?

"Grace accidentally doing donuts in a Fiat in Rome while being chased down by everyone in existence was one of the funniest moments this franchise has to offer. I loved the threat of this film being the Entity and Gabriel, it feels so ominous with its predictions. It‚Äôs not as air tight as Fallout, but this film is a blast of an entry that is up there with better half of this franchise. It‚Äôs awesome that the cast of the film and creatives have made us so comfortable with these casts that we can have moments like the ones on the canals where the characters just visually acknowledge each other with few words. The chemistry between the new additions and the mainstays in these films is just phenomenal as always, I could watch so many more of these characters just bouncing off each other.",2023-07-12 02:17:18
"Surely they're not going to fake Ilsa's death twice in the same movie?

1.) Fallout is still the best one

2.) Faust‚Äôs death was a rough point in an otherwise strong narrative 

3.) The villain‚Äôs just sorta‚Ä¶ there. Certainly no Cavill 

4.) Despite the poor treatment to Faust, the ladies really killed it this time around 

5.) A lot more like the first film in the franchise, assumedly building up to a heavy action oriented second half

6.) McQuarrie‚Äôs weakest, yet still VERY STONG entry",2023-07-12 05:56:41
"I really enjoyed this. Superb action, great humour and damn near every setpiece competes with the showstoppers of previous films.

Atwell is great and makes a superb addition to the team. Loved Pom. And seeing Kittridge back was great.

The only thing I really didn't like was the decision to kill off Ilsa. Rebecca Ferguson was such a brightspot of these recent films, and this choice was a genuine vibekiller that harmed my enjoyment for a good 15 minutes but that train sequence roared it back to life.",2023-07-12 02:11:45
[deleted],2023-07-12 02:09:03
Was anyone else genuinely devastated when Ilsa died? I didn‚Äôt even realize how much I loved having Rebecca Ferguson in this franchise. Like when Alec Baldwin died in fallout I just kinda shrugged and moved on. This one kinda hit differently tho.,2023-07-12 05:07:38
I really loved this movie and I hate when people get mad about a character dying but‚Ä¶ it fuckin sucks to know Part 2 won‚Äôt feature Ilsa unless they‚Äôre going heavy on flashbacks or did some stupid fakeout. I think her character is far more compelling than Haley Atwell‚Äôs and the replacement leaves me feeling hollow.,2023-07-12 02:19:38
"when Benjie activates self driving I almost shouted in the theater ‚Äúwhy would you do that‚Äù, esp since the Entity literally just hacked through their laptops. what makes them think that the Entity couldn‚Äôt also just hack through the self driving feature and crash the car?",2023-07-12 05:29:55
"Oh we FINALLY have a thread on this?

I saw it this afternoon...God fucking damn that psychopath did it again.

This movie was great.  And despite it being a part one...it was a fully fleshed out and finished film that stands completely on its own.  If the next one had a different name that wouldn't take away or being confusing at all.

The one complaint is that it felt a bit overly long with how it was paced but the choreography was top notch.",2023-07-12 03:49:28
"Great movie, Fallout is still the best one though. Hayley Atwell was incredible and so magnetic, great to see my boy Shea Whigham get some cool shit to do and great seeing Henry Czerny back for the first time since the first movie. 

The motorbike stunt was ruined by the hundreds of behind the scenes clips promoting it, however still cool but not as impressive on screen as the stunts in 4, 5 or 6. Killing off Ilsa after the misdirect of her dying at the very start was a bit stupid to be honest and the villain was pretty weak. The whole AI plot was a bit average but ultimately this film was well worth the wait. 

Also, anyone else think we really weren‚Äôt going to get the intro with the theme tune after about 10 mins had passed already?",2023-07-12 03:24:27
"I felt like Ilsa's death was random and out of blue? Like, I felt confusion rather than sadness. Wtf? It has to be a misdirection, right? Or did something happen behind the scenes? They spent last two movies building up her character and relationship with Ethan. She felt like a second main character almost. All that for her to be fridged? I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I just couldn't stop thinking about how weird her death was. 

I hope she comes back somehow because that death was not given weight or build up it deserved.",2023-07-12 02:18:23
"I thought it was a fun movie, if a bit exposition-y. I appreciated the goofiness of the action sequences with Hayley Atwell.

That said, the way they killed off Ilsa was so weird that I hope it was a misdirect. She‚Äôs barely there and then she dies without much fanfare? For a character that has been so important for the last two movies? If this is it for Ilsa, they did her dirty.",2023-07-12 07:47:59
"Ok it‚Äôs good, just to get that out of the way. 

Loved the train sequence obviously. Love Hayley of course. Liked the cops chasing Ethan in intense frustration. Soundtrack was outstanding. 

BUT man this had some misses for me. Hated what happened to Ilsa‚Äôs character. Not a fan of how much chasing there was. Grace runs away from Ethan like 6 separate occasions‚Ä¶ feels like it could have streamlined a little. Doesn‚Äôt feel like the supporting crew has much to do at all. And the villain is just sort of there. 

And the biggest let down for me is this one didn‚Äôt have any kind of elaborate heist plan. Grace wears a mask. But compared to the elaborate heists in previous MI movies, there was nothing even close to kidnapping PSH from the Vatican, the burj Khalifa swap, breaking into the Kremlin etc. I don‚Äôt think I would even put this in like my top five in the series. Didn‚Äôt feel like a MI movie to an extent. 

Looking forward to part 2 but hoping for a 45 minute insane set piece if possible",2023-07-12 21:18:56
"Amazing movie.. outside of the Ilsa death and immediately getting ‚Äòreplaced‚Äô.

"This is probably my least favorite of the McQuarrie-involving Mission Impossible movies, which is impressive because it's still a solid 8/10. I can't wait to watch every second of the making of feature on the train crash.",2023-07-12 02:29:16
"It has coincidentally been 12 years this month since Captain America:first avenger came out so why the hell did it take this long for hayley to land a huge role like this? I‚Äôm happy she did but man she should be getting more roles. 

Like omg I can‚Äôt get that slick ass tap on the shoulder move Ethan did outta my mind. Immediately she was captivating and their chemistry was great. 

The movie was great. Looking forward to the next one. And the whole train sequence reminded me of Uncharted 2. Which is another funny coincidence/parallel because Ethan and grace remind me of Nathan and Chloe (or Elena?) 

And I got to give a shout-out to pom klementieff. She was clearly having fun driving that big humvee",2023-07-12 02:13:08

Sucks that she's gone from MI :(",2023-07-12 02:07:08
"Overall I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with the movie. Especially considering Fallout being a masterpiece.

The editing and direction of many scenes was messy and just not very tight. Weird cuts to similar but slightly different shots or angles. It just didn‚Äôt feel very deliberate or focused sometimes. Compare it to a Fincher movie‚Ä¶ at this level I expect more.

Some of the fight choreography was just plain weak because it make no sense, especially Ilsa on the bridge in Venice. They kept dancing around each other instead of actually trying to kill one another with the sword and knife. John Wick this is not. 

Also the agent trying to shoot Hunt for the entire film gets plenty of possible shots but never takes it. Then what‚Äôs the point even? He keeps chasing him. For what?

I hate to say it but the major setpieces (the one everyone knows from the preview, and the train that follows) are overreliant on VFX and look somewhat cheap/fake. They barely show Hunt falling from the motorcycle jump and cut away so soon. It‚Äôs a shame because we know some parts are real, but the over the top nature of most of the last train scenes actually takes away from the impact of those real scenes.

The villain of the story is weak, both the entity and the person who works for him, Gabriel. He‚Äôs just a dude who can be scary, but mostly because we are told he is. I sure hope there‚Äôs more to ‚Äúthe entity‚Äù, because it lacks any interesting properties. Maybe there‚Äôs more to it, another character or party. It needs more of a motivation. I kept thinking of the AI in the game Metal Gear Solid 2 which had some great dialogue on why it was taking control.

The ending of the film is also just such a downer. No real tease for the next one. No big twist or cliffhanger. It just kinda ends right after the train stops. Which also went on for way too long.

Best parts of the movie:

- The entire airport part
- Hunt inside the HQ gassing his bosses and talking to Kittrige
- Pom being a maniac the whole movie
- Alley fight scene with Pom
- Hayley Atwell doing magic tricks",2023-07-14 23:19:22

"Ethan Hunt crash landing into a moving Orient Express saving Grace from being shot got the loudest applause and cheers in my screening over Cruise‚Äôs signature stunt (jumping off a cliff on his motorbike) was not on my bingo card. That scene is pure comedy gold. Whoever of the writers that though of that was genius. 

Btw, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not just me, but the movie didn‚Äôt even feel like it was 2hrs with its almost 3hr runtime. It‚Äôs an incredibly paced film.",2023-07-12 02:12:34
"It‚Äôs a weird one to talk about, because I generally enjoyed the hell out of it, but it also feels like the first time since 2 that one of these hasn‚Äôt bested it‚Äôs predecessor. And maybe that‚Äôs a bit harsh, since Fallout was as good as it was.

The few quandaries I have are minor, but I might as well mention them. One, maybe I missed something, but I didn‚Äôt get how Whigham and co. were always showing up wherever Ethan was. Once or twice is one thing, but for the sheer number of places they go, I would‚Äôve hoped for some explanation. It‚Äôs not like a ‚Äòplot hole‚Äô or anything, just curious. 

Two, did the ‚Äòclimb up through a falling train‚Äô sequence at the very end feel like it was one train car too many to anyone else? Started to feel a smidge too repetitive. 

And three, I know Ethan cares about people *in general*, but Gabriel positing that Ethan would have to choose between Ilsa- someone who he‚Äôs had a history with for the past couple movies- and Grace- essentially a random pickpocket he met a day or two ago‚Ä¶ treating those potential deaths as emotionally equivalent struck me as odd, is all. Of course having to make an active choice to say kill Grace isn‚Äôt something Ethan would do, but it felt like the movie was treating it as some Sophie‚Äôs choice.

Again, even lodging these ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôcomplaints‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô feels odd, as this is easily one of the best blockbusters we‚Äôve gotten since the start of the pandemic, but when your predecessor is MI:Fallout, the smudges seem to show a bit more.",2023-07-12 02:36:56
"A lot of mixed thoughts on this one. 

Obviously top notch action.  And overall I think it‚Äôs really good.  

There were a few more clunky parts here that kept it from being as sharp as Fallout. 

I do kind of wish they hadn‚Äôt shown the bike jump so much and so often leading up to the movie.  

I do think I will like it more on further watches.   I saw it last night at an advance screening and was kind of annoyed right off the bat when they showed not one but two sneak previews for Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One.",2023-07-12 02:10:28
JUSTICE FOR ILSA,2023-07-12 04:11:48
"Alright, I have a lot of thoughts so I apologize for how inarticulate this is, but here goes:

I loved this movie and consider it third best behind 1) Fallout and 2) Rogue Nation. My biggest gripe with the film was with Ilsa's death, and I've been sniffing that copium hard since I saw it last night. I think my love for this movie will either stay the same or decrease based on how it's resolved in Part 2, because I personally think she's still alive.

I feel like this was McQ's love letter to the first MI because there are some key similarities to name a few:

1. DR Part 1 was less action-centric than the previous installments, and focused more on deception, spycraft, and sleight of hand.
2. Both featured an explosive final act that took place on a train
3. Return of Henry Czerny's key character Kittridge, and most importantly...
4. A ""death"" on a bridge.

Ilsa's death was so abrupt and completely unceremonious. Hell, even Alec Baldwin got a more dramatic sendoff than Rebecca Ferguson. The scene right after her death, Ethan and the gang are talking about how they need to deceive the Entity. This leads me to believe it's possible that Ethan wanted the most capable agent on their team to be able to operate outside of the Entity's purview (assuming she IS even outside of it even after faking her death).

ALSO, Paris suffers a similar stab wound to Ilsa and at the end she ""has a pulse.""

I refuse to believe that McQ would be so careless to kill her off in such a disappointing manner simply to raise the stakes when they were already doing that with all of the expositional dialogue and heist scenes beforehand. McQ breathed the character of Ilsa into the franchise and clearly has love for her, as do many fans of the franchise. To me, she's easily the second best character behind Ethan in these movies because she more or less operates as an equal, which makes things really interesting since she's more morally grey than Ethan.

I really hope that the introduction of Grace wasn't the reason that McQ felt it necessary to off Ilsa simply because we can't have two badass female supporting characters in one franchise.

At the same time...the fact that they already faked Ilsa's death in the beginning once leads me to have doubts about my theory...because if she is alive in Part 2, then yeah, having a second fake-out is honestly quite silly.

I really loved this movie but if she's gone for real then I'll be incredibly disappointed, especially because of how it happened. Someone please whisper sweet nothings in my ear and tell me everything's gonna be okay. Someone please get McQ on the phone and have him tell me that he's saving Ilsa for a Gandalf-like reappearance like in the end of The Two Towers, where she inevitably emerges from the horizon with the cavalry of Maggie Q, Paula Patton, Jeremy Renner, and hell even Thandiwe Newton.",2023-07-12 03:18:30
"I might be alone here, but everything besides the stunts in this movie, which were incredible, was horrible. The melodramatic closeups, the cheesy Entity scenes, the totally ridiculous ‚ÄúI can hit two keystrokes and I‚Äôve hacked a satellite and airport security‚Äù scenes, untouchable/lame Gabriel, etc. 

It committed the ultimate movie sin for me: By the end of the movie, I didn‚Äôt care about any of the characters or really care to wait a year to see part two.",2023-07-13 13:44:17
"Nobody is talking about the guy in the beginning who delivers the mission message to Ethan. Ethan literally says ‚Äúwelcome to the IMF‚Äù and then we never see him again, but it seems like with all the plot holes and loose ends in Part 1 he has to come into the mix somehow, right?",2023-07-13 14:06:39
"Super enjoyable, start to finish. A very good Mission Impossible film. To me, not equivalent to Rogue Nation or Fallout, but excellent on its own merits.

Some small complaints:

- Wanted to see Gabriel better fleshed out, especially his history with Ethan. I don't think the film is hindered by his unknowns, but at the same time the film is asking us to buy him as Ethan's arch nemesis, based only on a repeated seven second grainy snippet of their past. Could've used an opening scene with him.

- While a lot of the action is top notch, it felt like it lacked some of the stakes and gravitas of previous films. That said, it was nice to not have nuclear weapons be the overarching threat for a change.

- Avoiding spoilers here, but I didn't think they needed to handle that certain showdown on the Venice bridge the way they did. It was well done for what it was, but it felt like an unnecessary motivation/stake raising, given that we're already supposed to understand both the threat and Gabriel and Ethan's history.

- This is a relatively small quibble, but in previous films wasn't the IMF portrayed as another ""known"" agency, akin to the CIA and NSA, but just lesser known publicly and seen as the black sheep of the intelligence community? How is it possible that the Director of National Intelligence would have NEVER heard of the IMF?
What about all the previous Directors of IMF we've seen? What about Alex Baldwin in the last film when he mentioned making a ""lateral move"" from Director of the CIA to Director of IMF?",2023-07-12 03:50:31

"Taking a vote, who was the most unhinged character: Pom Klementiff as Paris or Shea Whigham's hair?

As a confirmed HuntHead I thought this was very solid, but when compared to the masterpiece of action filmmaking and pacing that is Fallout it does feel a little deflated. I'm going to try not to make this review a full comparison to Fallout, but I'll just say that this being a Part One and some other decisions kept this from being anywhere near that level. I still very much enjoyed it, it's probably the 4th best M:I film and it's keeping good company.

One major criticism I have is that I feel the intro scene with the submarine should have been the intro to Part 2. These movies usually have Ethan a step ahead of us as viewers and it's always very satisfying when he reveals that to us. In this movie, Ethan is trying to find information that we already know. The final moments of the film and the final piece of information he extracts from Pom is something we've known literally the whole runtime. That mixed with knowing this is a Part One and they won't even go to the sub made the pacing of this movie feel off and the final scene feel anti-climactic, despite the awesome set piece of the falling train cars.

Beyond that, I was really interested in the ideas at play. The Entity is a neat villain although I do feel there's still so much we don't know about Gabriel and Ethan's past. I loved the contrast between Ilsa and Grace. Ilsa being the intelligent spy always working an angle and a hell of a driver, Grace being a petty thief with no idea what she's into and an awful driver. 

I do have complaints about how they handled Grace's character, but my massive crush on Atwell tells me it's not a big deal. I was pretty upset with what they did to Ilsa tho, in my opinion she's had a huge hand in the quality of the last two movies and is the best female character they've written by far. 

What really fuckin hums in this movie is, of course, the action and the determination Tom Cruise can convey with his running. I loved the handcuffed driving scene, the aforementioned train scene, and that narrow alley fight was something I could tell they were really challenging themselves with. I love Pom's character, I love to see Whigham in anything, I loved that they brought back Czerny and shot that awesome scene where Ethan knocks out the meeting room of officials just to talk with him like a De Palma scene with all those dramatic angles. 

Overall this movie is really something. It's unfair to say it's not the greatest action film of the next five years, but that's strangely what I've come to expect from these movies. I wish the ""Part one"" of it all was handled better. This was a great movie to watch but I didn't feel like it had a complete arc or set up anything for me to look forward to like Spiderverse did. You could argue Rogue Nation and Fallout are a combo as well, but each had a satisfying arc and ending to the villains. This just seems like the halfway point of a very long M:I movie. But, the action was handled well and while it may not be perfect it's still probably one of the top three action movies that will be released this year. It's an 8/10.

"I thought it was a fun and entertaining movie, but I found it McQuarrie's weakest entry so far in the franchise. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing since he's made some great MI movies.

I don't know what was more enjoyable watching: Paris tear through the city having the time of her life or Grace's efforts behind the wheel.

Was great to see the talented Indira Varma and Charles Parnell in the beginning scene discussing the Entity. I do kinda think they got repetitive with discussing the AI, felt a bit superfluous. That they were dragging the conversation for the Ethan reveal.  (But could def be a me problem and one I'll realize I was wrong about in my next viewing.) A nice bonus in that scene was catching Angela Basset's photo on the wall to show her character is still around.

I didn't like Ilsa's death at all. It just reeks of her being fridged.  Didn't like how they undid Ilsa's development in Fallout. By the end of it, she's free and clear, and then she's right back into trouble at the beginning of this one? I know the Entity is to blame, but just wish they went a different route with her character like her joining Ethan at IMF instead of feeling like her character went back to Zero. Respectfully, it just wasn't a direction/choice I liked. Her death does make me wonder if maybe Ferguson wanted out/got too expensive or busy? Or was it none of those things and they just chose her (poorly, I'd add) to be the sacrificial lamb to show  this enemy is serious.

I thought the actor for Gabriel was good, but just wasn't that impressed at how he was built up as Ethan's 'big bad,' but its hard to do given that we're 7 movies into this awesome franchise. But Dead Reckoning part 2 could def change my mind on him and his backstory with Ethan, but as a standalone, I was only meh about him.

I don't claim to be a movie critic/expert, all I can claim is to knowing what I like and this was fun. Some great set pieces, good gags like the agent trying to take off faces that he thought were masks, great acting all around, with some good banter including the duos of Benji and Luthor, and Grace and Ethan. Grace made a great debut in this franchise, and was a delight throughout the movie. I was also satisfied with how it ended, I thought they wrapped it up well while also hinting to what was to come in part 2.",2023-07-12 02:56:19
"It‚Äôs hard to criticize a movie this well crafted but I came out of the theater disappointed. Not because it‚Äôs anywhere near a bad film, but because the overall experience felt empty. This is a new sensation for me with this franchise.

The A.I. element with hot buzz words like cryptocurrency thrown around didn‚Äôt work for me. Everything with Gabriel fell flat. Maybe the second film will solidify the character but he‚Äôs a poor villain compared to the Syndicate and Solomon Lane.

I can forgive all that, I mean it‚Äôs still enjoyable gobbledygook. But what they did with Ilsa was **nonsense**. A tremendous waste of a wonderful character that has spent the last two films becoming better and better. I don‚Äôt understand the goal here. Maybe Covid delays interfered with Rebecca Ferguson‚Äôs schedule? What a lame death, man. 

This did not come anywhere near the exhilarating heights of Rogue Nation or Fallout for me. Although bringing back Kittridge was genius.

Summer of sadness between this and Indy. Maybe my expectations were too high. Barbie/Oppenheimer please save me.",2023-07-12 02:45:00

"Call me absolutely mad, but did anyone else feel like this was building towards some kind of Metal Gear Solid 2 *""Turn off the game...""* AI twist?

I'm probably wrong, but from start to finish the film felt like it was trying to suggest something uncanny valley. I was honestly waiting for some sort of reveal that the main characters were being put through some AI simulation.

Almost every shot during a conversation is from below the chin looking upwards, until Luther specifically tells Ethan about their final plan; Luther is almost the only character that ever gets a from-above angle. The camera cuts back and forth sharply between characters before they've finished their sentences.

Each character seems to have certain tics or behaviours that they didn't quite have before - Ethan is more hesitant and tends to grimace, Grace wears a dizzy smile for many of her scenes, the White Widow has a dazed gaze in her eyes, and Gabriel does not blink even once during the film. It's almost as if Gabriel is a manifestation of the AI itself, as he somehow knows what the key unlocks, is fiercely jealous of anyone else who might know, and comes across as the ""Big Bad"" antagonist trope to everyone who encounters him.

Some scenes also play out as if they're trying to suggest a VR simulation. A bizarrely random nuclear weapon turns up in a bag, is disarmed through riddles and games, and never comes up again. Not one person comments on the issue of a tactical nuke turning up at an airport, even if it was fake.

Agents rigourously pursue Ethan through a strangely calm and quiet airport. Planes take off and land, people stroll around leisurely, and security is completely absent as if nobody can see two massive armed military helicopters circling the airport. An AI playfully leads the agents astray in locating their target. Luther can somehow open unpowered fire escape doors remotely through his computer.

During the Venice chase, Ilsa and Gabriel fight to the death in a very well-choreographed sword fight. Ilsa is expressionless, and dies with neither blood nor fanfare. When the camera focuses on them, it's *perfectly* stable and cinematic. As soon as the shot cuts back to Ethan and Paris fighting in the alleyways, the camera is so shaky and erratic that it's sometimes difficult to even see who beats who. Every shot in Venice follows this rule - Gabriel's shots are slow and stable, Ethan's shots are shaky and erratic.

The humour was also pretty off the charts - in a good way; it was really enjoyable. But out of curiosity I watched Fallout again after this, and the tone is completely different. Ethan doesn't balk at strategies involving jumps, and doesn't really drive/shoot/travel in ways that seem humorous. Fallout is a serious film. During this film, my entire cinema was in stitches during the Italy scene, and laughed even harder when Alanna dropped unconscious for the *third* time in a row on the train before *still* swaying left and right like a drunk.

I've made a bet with friends that Part 2 will reveal that Part 1 was an AI simulation for the entity to learn more about Ethan. I'll probably lose, but damn I'll be happy if I end up just 5% right.",2023-07-12 22:51:29
"I loved Pom Klementiff's psychotic assassin henchman vibe, so it will be interesting how they go about filling that void for Gabriel's team in part 2. Because you gotta have some fun henchmen",2023-07-12 02:22:03
"I had very high expectations after Fallout, and those expectations were not met. I think the dialogue in this is pretty bad and the editing is odd too. Still enjoyed it though and I‚Äôm sure Part 2 will bump this one up a little.",2023-07-12 06:26:25
"I'll never get over how well done the humor is in these films. Compared to Marvel where there is just a bunch of unnecessary humor done at the most unnecessary times, the use of both verbal, physical, & practical humor in this film is superb",2023-07-12 03:36:39
"Damn, the women in this Mission Impossible movie in particular were just awesome!

Haley Atwell showing us why Steve Rogers went back in time for more than just a dance. (Can't wait to see her join the crew with Ethan, Benji, & Luthur).

Rebecca Ferguson although a brief appearance established herself as such an intriguing character in Rogue Nation & Fallout making her death here heartbreaking. (Knife fight with Gabriel on a bridge over a canal in Venice was so dope tho)

Vanessa Kirby being a hilariously entertaining broker as she was in Fallout (and her being a fun drunk)

& finally, Pom Klementieff being sexy, badass, & surprisingly maniacally evil while driving the jeep around Rome was just fantastic. Glad they didn't kill her off, it'll be interesting to see if they bring her character back & what role it'll be in.",2023-07-12 03:32:52
"Killing off Ilsa was weird after the fakeout earlier. It gave me some Walking Dead vibes with Glenn. It lessened the impact if that's the case and didn't seem like a good send-off. Not sure about Hayley Atwell as a ""replacement"" either, unless she turns out to be Ethan's daughter or something (just a wild theory). Well, I'd prefer that over another maybe-love-interest again.",2023-07-12 02:55:01

"I quite liked it. Though as a fan of the franchise, I recognize I'm not entirely impartial.

The HFRO homage in the opening scene was great.

And for as much as this is clearly ""Part One"" it also told a fully contained narrative of its own - there is more story to come, but this story stands on its own.  Which really stood out to me after FasTen (Your Seatbelts) and Across the Spiderverse both ended on hard cliffhangers.

I have two complaints, really.

Ilsa got done dirty; I could expound, but I won't here and now.

Up against a rogue AI able to penetrate any digital system, necessitating both the IMF team and mainstream intelligence agencies revert to offline / analog tech, Benji enables Self-Driving mode and gets out of the driver's seat, trusting his safety and life to the digital technology of the vehicle.

I mean, I know that the scene was there like that because it was product placement, included to show off the awesome technology BMW wants us to believe their vehicles possess. And I haven't minded the nested ads in the previous films for the awesome crash protection and general coolness of the Beamers, but this one is in such conflict with the story it's injected into that it ganked my immersion temporarily.",2023-07-12 05:25:18
"For the love of everything holy they better bring Ilsa back in part 2 or else. Because if she's dead for real, what the actual fuck was that death? Not only did she get killed off so unceremoniously merely to up the stake and give Ethan some angst, but the team also moved on after like 2 seconds of half-hearted grief then she got immediately replaced by Grace. They spent 2 movies building up Ethan and Ilsa's relationship, and while never spoken aloud, the two of them most certainly had a thing going on. There's the utter lack of reaction, the way the team kinda avoided stating explicitly that Ilsa is dead. Seems to me like a setup for a twist, perhaps a plan to help Ilsa go underground to evade the entity. McQ is too good a writer to fridge one of his best characters like that.",2023-07-13 03:53:32

"Initial thoughts after just getting out of the movie:  

* Enjoyed the movie for the most part but I have more complaints than positives.   I‚Äôd put it middle of the pack in terms of my MI ranking, I think 4-6 are way superior.   

* The first 30 or so minutes were extremely slow, odd editing, scenes that went on way too long.   Didn‚Äôt feel like an MI film.  Nothing but dialogue, flashbacks of things we just saw happen, not even any background music.  Just felt odd.

* Another thought of the beginning, that conversation between the half dozen US agents in the conference room went on way too long and was distracting how they would all finish each other‚Äôs sentences.  

* Way too many closeup shots throughout the movie.  Especially during dialogue, quickly switching to a closeup of different peoples faces was distracting and got hard to follow the conversation. 


* Did anyone else have trouble following the story?  At a high level I understood it‚Ä¶I think.  But so many different people wanted the keys, and the keys were stolen so many times, I had trouble figuring out who was good vs bad and what each persons motive is.  

* Gabriel as a character needed fleshed out way more.  I didn‚Äôt feel I should hate him like the movie wanted you to.  It was some random 3 second clips from before Ethan joined IMF.  I have no idea who he killed and why he did it.   

* I think they could‚Äôve trimmed 15 minutes from the movie. 

* Haley Atwell is a babe.

* Cruise really is the goat.",2023-07-16 22:52:04
"Grace is the we have Ilsa Faust at home for this movie. 

Though I won‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs a misdirect. The latter half of the movie felt like they were putting on a show for the entity at points.",2023-07-12 03:10:00
"Eh.. didn't like this one. The story moves at a pace that there's no time to actually digest what's happening. How did the keys end up found from the ocean? Why did Grace and Ilsa both run to the bridge to fight Gabriel? We have 6 Mission Impossible movies, why did they feel like they needed to have a very poorly filmed flashback sequence to give Ethan Hunt some backstory? Couldn't we take something from any of the 6 prior films? Why did Ilsa get jobbed by old man Gabriel? I'm sure each of these things have reasonable answers, but the pacing doesn't give you even a second to reflect on what's happening or has happened. 

The thing is, whatever. All of it on its own, probably a decent enough film. But as a follow up to Fallout and Rogue Nation... this doesn't even feel like the same people worked on this movie. Take for example that scene with all the heads of different branches of intelligence or security postulating about the entity... that scene *was so bad*, I honestly thought we were watching a scene of what the AI thought was going on. Or it was another Wolf Blitzer fake-out. 

Oh well. Bit disappointed with this one. Fallout was just such a great time at the theatre, so I'm feeling a little shocked at how this one played out. Hopefully it's better on a re-watch.",2023-07-12 15:36:40
"McQuarrie has gotten seriously good at directing. He and his DP‚Äôs shot selection, camerawork, and lighting are very impressive here. The first half I was just constantly marveling at how much I felt like I was in the action without the use of shitty shakycam. McQ has talked a lot about learning from movie to movie and how unhappy he was with his previous work. But I think he did really well here.",2023-07-12 02:16:15
"I'm the biggest fan of MI:6. It's the only film I went to see twice in cinema, and was grinning in joy through all of it.

This one did not cut it for me, and unfortunately, with how high the reviews were and me not having seen anything prior to avoid spoilers, it was a very, very large letdown. Some notes:

MI:6 had unbelievable stunts and set-pieces all connected with a great plot and tight story. Here the pacing and writing felt off enough to pull me out of the movie a few times. It was clear we were going from stunt to stunt, and honestly the new set-pieces, whilst pretty awesome, aren't a step up from Fallout.

Killing one of, if not the coolest character in such a dubious way and both very quickly moving forward and meta replacing them (also immediately after???) felt off putting.

I understand wanting to add importance to the new villain, but introducing him as this important genesis character for Ethan through weird flashbacks was detrimental. They could have easily introduced Gabriel as someone new. The stakes are already high and Ethan's character is sufficiently fleshed out. I feel that for this back-in-time stuff to work the movie would of had to put much more time into it, but as it is it felt like a shoe in for added dramatic importance.

Comedic timing was off for me. 5 and 6 were funny at the right moments, where this one was overly preoccupied with everything else.

Dialog felt messy. The best example I can think of is the scene with all the higher ups at the intelligence meeting at the start, and how everyone is seemlesly finishing everyone else's sentences. Luckily, the second half of the movie delivered better in this aspect.

Scenes like the desert and airport felt like they were building up to something bigger and didn't properly pay off. The big train sequence had a LOT of moving parts and I feel lost a bit of focus with having pretty much all(?) of the characters in it. Also the bike jump was cool, but even for MI having Ethan accidentally save the day by jumping into the right window was a bit too wild.

However, there are positives here... Movie still looked cool. Action overall was still solid, the OST, whilst not as impactful as Fallout's, was still very good (although a bit samey- tho not complaining!). Chasing after the Macguffin was silly but fun.

I won't lie and say I'm not seeing part 2. I hold MI:6 so dearly in my memory that I owe the team a chance with the follow up. As for Ilsa coming back theories, and the issues I had here being fixed... I'm lowering my expectations. Although I am aware that part 2 has no set-up to make, so there's some hope.

I almost never engage negatively around media, but I loved, LOVED the previous title so much that I felt compelled to write here. Truly rooting for Part 2 to excite me in theatres next year.

Sorry for how long this was, but luckily you don't have to read twice, because this message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.",2023-07-12 03:37:59
"I must say I was a bit‚Ä¶ disappointed. This one literally felt like half a movie to me, and my ultimate opinion will depend on Part II. 

The train scene was good. The stunt from the cliff was pretty cool but didn‚Äôt wow me as much as precious ones. And the Rome chase was nothing new. 

Ilsa‚Äôs death was totally unnecessary. Hoping she comes back for Part II. Otherwise, it‚Äôd be a total waste of an amazing character.",2023-07-12 07:20:58
Loved the cast but why did all of the dialogue feel like it was written by an edgy teenager? Especially bad in the scene with the American intelligence group in the beginning of the movie.,2023-07-13 23:11:27
"This is going to be unpopular it seems, but I honestly thought the plot was poorly written. Outside of the action sequences, it was basically the cast sitting in a room spoon feeding the audience what just happened, the current state of affairs, then the plan going forward ‚Äî rinse repeat 3/4 times between action sequences and were done. Little character development, just characters reciting what we just saw and are about to see. 

Maybe that‚Äôs to be expected for these movies. Either way I‚Äôd still give it a 7.5-8 for a solid action flick.",2023-07-18 14:10:00
I really enjoyed the movie but the scene where Grace is in the mask kept bothering me because the White Widow‚Äôs brother had plenty of time to notice her eye color was different.

Vanessa Kirby nailed playing Grace playing Widow,2023-07-14 20:03:55
"A lot of people talking about how great Grace is and how much they enjoyed her character and I just don't get it. Grace is the most frustrating character in the franchise. I really disliked her. How many times does Ethan need to come in and save you before you understand the gravity of the situation and that you are not equipped to deal with it yourself? She just didn't get it over and over and over and over. Made her character feel inept, foolish, and unlikable to me. 75% of the movie was Ethan chasing her around and cleaning up after her. Could have been a fun, cute premise in a different movie. In this one though, it was just frustrating.

Unfortunately, my dislike for Grace really kind of killed the emotional weight of Ilsa's death. Instead of really feeling it and remembering her history with the team and Ethan's feelings for her, and appreciating her sacrifice - I was just pissed off at Grace, because surprise, this was yet another mess she got herself into by only thinking about herself and preventing Ethan from helping.

I don't feel like Grace earned her welcome to the team.

All that aside, the movie was fucking rad. Not as great as Fallout, but did have some of the more memorable moments of the franchise.",2023-07-12 16:49:35
"Just got out and wow what a ride.

My only real gripe with the movie is the Part 1 in the title.  It takes away some of the suspense because you know there will be a follow up.  Should have done the marketing like Dune and then displayed the Part 1 at the title of the actual movie. It‚Äôs a nitpick for me but I feel it takes away from the suspense a bit. 

 The next Bond is in serious trouble trying to keep up with Ethan Hunt at this point. 

The ‚Äúvillain‚Äù is inspired.  Doesn‚Äôt have emotions, doesn‚Äôt have doubt, doesn‚Äôt feel pain, and can‚Äôt be intimidated.  All it sees is probabilities and possible outcomes.  In the world we are living in right now, it seemed EXTREMELY relevant especially with the speech Kittridge gives to Ethan at the beginning. If that‚Äôs our future we are throughly fucked. 

Cruise runs not once, not twice, but three times in this one. Hasn‚Äôt missed a stepped.  He still looks the part and still maintains Hunt as having a heart instead of a cold blooded assassin. 

Hayley Atwell is the most distracting thing in the movie in the best possible way.  She‚Äôs charming, vulnerable, and insanely attractive. The combination of her, Ferguson, and Pom were all next level ‚ÄúBond girls.‚Äù  Beautiful but very capable of taking care of themselves.  Pom was especially shocking.  I‚Äôve only ever seen her as Mantis so seeing her as a kick ass assassin was great and she was clearly having a lot of fun. Vanessa Kirby seems to have gotten the short end of the stick in this one but hopefully she makes up for it with more time in Part 2. 

The stunt was great and the build up to it was pretty damn funny with Pegg egging Cruise on.  I have no idea what Cruise does next.  Unless he skin dives the Bering Sea naked or climbs up the side of a rocket on its way to space, I‚Äôm running out of ideas as to what he can do to keep tipping himself. 

Cruise has had a terrific run here for the last 15 years.  There is no doubt he has cemented his status as a bonafide movie star.  He might never win an Oscar for a particular performance but the dude damn sure deserves a lifetime achievement Oscar for what he has done for his career. 

The best part about it is you can tell Cruise cares. Everything outside of cinema might be loony or weird but when it comes to the job. The dude goes all out.  He really is aiming to entertain the audience and make you feel like your money was well spent. 

I‚Äôm not sure how many more of these he has left but Ethan Hunt has outlasted two different iterations of James Bond and basically has made Jason Bourne a fond memory.",2023-07-14 00:00:29
"I found the inconclusive nature of Ethan's relationship with Ilsa weirdly forced. She invited him to run away with her in Rogue Nation, which was an obvious romantic/sexual proposition to leave the spy life behind so they can be together (validated by Luther's, ""oh...boy..."").

By the time Fallout ends and Ethan almost dies, Ilsa is casting him longing looks and caressing his face. To me, it was clearly implied they'd be together after that inflection point - not necessarily in a traditional domestic sort of way, of course, since they're agents, but the films have showed us they have strong feelings for each other and have gotten to a place where they're mutually expressing their attraction openly.

I mean, they're both attractive people, people fuck, people have relationships within varied boundaries, and Ethan finally finds a match that is the opposite of Julia in the sense that Ilsa can keep up with his lifestyle and fend for herself. It seemed obvious to me that they'd have a thing already going in some form, casual or not, by the seventh based on the trajectory of their relationship.

Yet we find Ilsa far away from Ethan doing her own thing, despite the fact that she had become wholly embedded into his team by the end of Fallout. Worst of all, from a character perspective (not a fanboy ""shipping"" perspective), there's been no progression in their relationship. When he sees her in the desert, he's caressing her face and being all tender/touchy, which is a romantic gesture, but there's no kissing or words of acknowledgement. It's like McQuarrie purposely wants to evade anything that would naturally exist based on what we've seen, and this turns the MI world into a weirdly asexual place (the way Star Wars, for instance, is wholly aromantic/asexual, with the exception of Empire).

It's not that I want to see characters getting it on because that doesn't fit the MI tone or structure, but it's equally weird that the relationship is never clear or advanced or addressed outside of this dumb limbo. Then on the balcony in Venice they have a flirty, touchy interaction, followed by...not holding hands, exactly, but tenderly holding arms/hands in the gondola. Clearly they're super into each other and both know it, but they never cross some imaginary chaste line for no reason? They're both spies, they both live that life, they love each other, and yet this weird evasion for no reason.

After that, they kill off Elsa. Ethan's whole character has thus far been defined as a gambler who will not sacrifice anyone on his team to get the job done, who refuses to let anyone die. He is defined by his need to protect everyone no matter what. This is the first time in the series that Ethan has lost someone centeal from his team (secretaries like Alec Baldwin don't count); in this case, the one person he had a romantic attachment to. He finally loses a gamble and fails to keep his people safe, which is a core of who he is.

And the story doesn't show us his grief over this effectively, even at all. There's a silent moment where he's sad when he discovers her and then he just kinda carries on. I get that almost killing the villain is supposed to be an expression of his rage, but c'mon- we don't see his sense of loss portrayed in any meaningful way.

Look, I don't mind losing Ilsa if it's going to serve the story, even if it's a bummer. But the way she was unceremoniously dispatched without shattering Ethan or fundamentally changing him, then plugging in another pretty girl for him to have romantic tension vibes with right after was poorly handled. I like Grace, her dynamic and chemistry with Ethan was great. 

But I just feel like the writer didn't know what to do with Ilsa and thus didn't treat her character the way it deserved. I considered her death being fake but the way it was done negates that possibility. 

I assume  that the artificial vague non-romantic romance with Ethan and Ilsa continued so that Ethan could still have plausible sparks with Grace. But it just comes off as lamely written and does Ethan's character a disservice. Ilsa is almost up there with Julia for him as someone he deeply loves and wants to protect, so the way it was handled didn't make sense.

Super entertaining film overall, though (I mean, the train sequence bordered on Looney Tunes exaggeration but was so spectacular that I was fine with it!).",2023-07-17 16:04:09
"Love that the last 15 min turn into a disaster movie lol that train set piece was so good, reminded me of Uncharted 2 meets Titanic",2023-07-12 02:17:08
"So it pains me to write this comment that probably no one will care about, but this movie really disappointed me. From introducing a useless character in Grace, yes I like Haley Atwell but in the 7th movie of this franchise she was unneeded, to the team just glossing over Ilsa's death, to introducing a bunch of new characters that were as shallow as a 2 inch puddle with not true motivations, to entirely dragged out scenes and exposition that made this movie wayyyy longer than it needed to, I came out deflated. 

I believe that since MI:3 this franchise has gradually improved and McQuarrie proved he knew what he was doing..... Until we got to Dead Reckoning Part 1. We got a few good action scenes, some Tom Cruise running, and a whole lot of new/boring characters that don't even need to be in the story. Gabriel is the main bad guy. Why is he working for the Entity? Idk. Why was he chosen by the Entity? Idk. Why does he have a rivalry other than a cliche flashback of killing someone Ethan loves? Idk. Why does Grace get a spot on the team when she consistently proves she doesn't have any skills, is a flight risk, and quite literally just got Ilsa killed? I think the writing room was invaded by 5 year olds or taken over by Tom Cruise entirely because this movie is just not the same as McQuarries other mission impossible films. Unless DR part 2 is absolutely phenomenal, I really don't see how they could drag another 2+ hour movie as a sequel to this almost 3 hour movie that doesn't feel like a slog fest.",2023-07-12 02:31:36
"Loved the movie, except what they did to Ilsa of course. It makes absolutely no sense. Killing literally the second most important character so randomly. **It's cheap & disrespectful.** Paris is killed the same way, but ends up being alive, I really hope that was a hint that Ilsa was also alive. Are we supposed to just move on & start shipping Ethan-Grace?? No way. Yes they are a great pair, but not every new girl has to be Ethan's soulmate.

It would make way more sense that there's a twist in MI8, which reveals that Ilsa's death was faked. Would make sense in the defeating AI plot. MI8 is supposedly the last film of the series, it's the finale, Ilsa&Ethan finally getting some peace together would be right ending. Not Ethan ending up with a girl he met an hour ago. Their chemistry was fire though, still doesn't beat the preexisting couple. Ilsa is almost as good as Ethan in combat, being an agent, yet she just loses so easily, while Grace(a pickpocketer) fights way better against the same guy? Makes no sense. Not to mention the importance the two women have. One is like the wife of the main character & is the second main/most important character. The other is just a rando he met an hour ago.

Ilsa has to be alive in MI8. Rebecca's name is there in part2's cast & she has also shot for some scenes. Could be flashback scenes, but I really hope that she turns out to be alive in part2, otherwise I'm going to end up hating my most favourite movie franchise.",2023-07-12 17:20:14
Killing off Ilsa in such a random way to then establish Grace was weird.,2023-07-14 22:37:55
"I am a giant fan of the franchise and 100% not a Mission Impossible critic. I have literally loved every other MI movie to death and watched them repeatedly.

Dead Reckoning is one of the worst MI movies ever made and I couldn't be more disappointed. I have no interest in watching part 2.

For the first time I felt like the main purpose of the movie was the spectacle and everything else was in support of that.

Ethan Hunt is suddenly skittish and apologizing for driving into a wall? I get that they were trying to setup a gag, but they failed. It only became apparent after the fact and felt totally out of character.

I didn't buy Hayley Atwell's character at all. Especially as a potential MI agent. And if Ethan could pick her pockets so easily, he could also just as easily put those items back on that guy himself. It was 100% unnecessary and contrived to involve her at all.

Ilsa Faust's character's involvement and death were severely underwhelming.

Shot after shot were Mission Impossible cliches at this point. Take the boat ride which they do in every MI movie now.  Cool scenic shot here, unnecessary boat ride in a foreign country there. The whole movie felt like contrived scenes stitched together with MI cliches and gratuitous, unnecessary stunts.

I have never felt like an MI movie was more predictable or underwhelming in every way.",2023-10-14 19:54:13
"Another great entry to the franchise. Not fallout level of excellence but that was such a ridiculously high bar. 

I think where it fell short was the clunky exposition at times and perhaps the Cary elwes sub plot that could have been cut.  But still the time flew by and all the set pieces were terrific. 

Highlights for me were of course the train sequence, the Venice sequence ( and the score during that sequence was just chefs kiss), and the airport sequence was classic mission impossible mask sequence brought into the digital age. 

Looking forward to Ethan and Benjie going full analog in the next movie.",2023-07-12 02:43:05
"Man, everyone here has pretty much nailed anything I wanted to say about this film. Saw it in full IMAX and was blown away, so much fun. The train, the Fiat chase, everything was ü§åüèª

Also; shout out to all the women in this film. Pom, Haley, Rebecca, and Venessa were operating on all cylinders. I really couldn‚Äôt choose a favorite between them.",2023-07-13 02:50:54
"I will always enjoy a Mission Impossible as much as the next fan, and I did enjoy this one because STUNTS, but I am fairly pissed at the 100% positive, nothings wrong reviews surrounding this movie. 7 had some serious flaws and you'd think with this writer's strike going on you'd see more reviewers highlight the NEED for better paid writers. The pickpocketing key gimmick got real old by Rome. Too many plot development lands at my feet moments. I don't think they handled the seriousness of the entity situation very well, especially in that security debrief meeting. Why did Ilsa have to die again? Stop with the rehashed Fallout drums at every. single. moment (not really a script complaint but maybe they saved money on a composer as well). I'm going to see Part 2 for sure, but only for submarine STUNTS. This movie could have been really something with a better script.",2023-07-27 09:35:18
"Watched it twice in one day and noticed something interesting although not sure if intentional:

Luther and Ethan have a conversation in which Luther tells Ethan that to beat the Entity, they have to think like it. ‚ÄúCold, logical‚Ä¶‚Äù something like that. Basically telling him to act logically and without emotion. And I mean, like we‚Äôve seen with the previous films, that‚Äôs not really Ethan. He‚Äôd do anything to save his friends, even if that were to mean jeopardizing the mission. But in the end it always works out.

In this movie, we see multiple characters acting on emotion. Shea Wigham‚Äôs character choosing not to shoot Ethan even though he said Ethan is expendable (they seem to have a past), Ethan sparing Paris, and in turn Paris saving Ethan and Grace, and then Grace declining to send the money to herself and deciding to help Ethan. Also not to forget Ethan saying ‚Äúscrew logic‚Äù and actually attempting to kill Gabriel at the end (even Gabriel is confused because he, and by extension the Entity, thought that Ethan would spare him for sake of not knowing what the key would unlock). All these things seem to defy the Entity‚Äôs logic and play a big role in driving the plot forwards and forcing Ethan towards the end of the mission.",2023-07-12 04:50:35
"As much as I loved Grace, was it really necessary to kill off Ilsa so Grace could take her place? 

It's pretty offensive that we finally got a female regular on the team and then they just decided to kill her off so that Grace could take her spot. 

Emmanuelle Beart, Thandie Newton (to be fair, she was never a member of the team), Maggie Q, Paula Patton and then Rebecca Ferguson took the spot and it seemed like the franchise kept her in for good but then she got the Keri Russell treatment. 

Oh well, hope Haley Atwell's Grace doesn't suffer the same fate.",2023-07-12 09:23:56
Star Wars has not reached the level of mission impossible,2023-07-12 02:06:52
A small gripe i have about the movie,2023-07-12 08:55:55
Killing off Ilsa (if she's really dead) is dumbest decision of this franchise since when they turned Jim Phelps into a lame villain.,2023-07-12 18:21:03
"While I greatly enjoyed the train sequence, movie felt disappointing.

The story felt so unnecessarily stretched. The intro till Ethan meeting Kittridge was expositions placed like a group presentation. The meeting room with all characters taking turn in explaining the entity in QnA felt like a classroom. Many a times, between IMF team, the dialogues felt like a group presentation of expositions as well than real conversation.

I still dont get what they were trying with Amsterdam parcel scene in start to show Ethan's mission. Ilsa is said to be hiding in desert but it felt like she was depolyed in the middle of nowhere. 

A lot of scenes could have been trimmed. Entity or Gabriel didn't invoke much sense of danger. The only time I felt some sense of danger was when entity faked Benji's voice, but they left it there as a one off and cut to the bridge fight. Gabriel fighting Grace and then Ilsa in that order felt weird. I don't see the point of machine asking one girl's death. If it wants Ethan out, it could easily have; the play felt forced. Same with pom n the other guy trying to kill Ethan in fist fight.

I know its hard to top Fallout but I wish this movie was made tighter.",2023-07-14 22:39:13
So nobody else thought it was super cheesy?,2023-07-15 03:46:31
I liked it but something about it felt off to me. I think after IIsas death I kinda checked out. The pacing of the climatic sequence was off with the flip back and forth between Ethan on the bike and the train. Also missing out on the complete parachute jump for a dues ex machina device to save Grace,2023-07-16 14:35:46
"Anyone else think this movie was just average? Outside of the ending train sequence I didn't really feel like there were any standout moments from this movie, especially considering how great Fallout was. Hoping Part 2 really ups the ante but I was kind of disappointed in this one.",2023-07-18 13:53:53
"Thoughts:

* Kittridge should have been in way more of those films, he's fantastic.
* Those CIA guys chasing Tom Cruise around were great.  Don't know if they need to be chasing him around in the next one, per se, but if they were there in another capacity, would be neat.
* The new female agent (Atwell) and the new female villain (French chickadee) are just great.
* That room that disguised-Tom Cruise gassed near the start was stacked with quality actors, kind of fun to see, maybe a little collection of people Cruise has worked with and asked to come on or something like that.
* Killing Ilsa Faust almost ruined the film for me, took me until about when Kittridge appears again on the train before the sour taste passed.  I hope that they didn't croak her for real, that would be so fucked, she's like the best recurring character in the series, kind of on a par with Cruise.  Killing her like that was just so, I don't know, lame.  Bring her back!
* Simon Pegg is looking his age, Ving peaced out for the entire final heist probably because he's a giant old man too.  How long can these folks last?
* Great set piece type scenes as expected but that final train escape was something else, very well executed.
* That club scene is not going to age well.
* The Arabian desert, Abu Dhabi, Rome, Venice, and the Alps - not bad.
* They had four great and super attractive (and deadly/sneaky) female actors in the film, a shame they didn't get there a few films earlier in the series, because they can really turn it up.
* Quite a humorous film, but it's sort of old people humor.  I'm guessing that Tom Cruise has to approve every joke.
* Glad that the brother to the blonde widow woman didn't get croaked, I like him looming in these scenes, he's a great bit of decor.
* Lastly, I expect there will probably be some sort of twist where the AI was bringing Tom Cruise to it all along, and that it plucked that guy from Cruise's past basically to orchestrate the entire long play with that result in mind.  Sorry if I spoiled it.",2023-07-13 06:32:11
"Am I the only one who thought it was too long and the story was kinda meh? 

Best part was atwell, who's gorgeous",2023-07-14 20:22:30
"Surprisingly disappointed, after seeing and reading so many really good reviews and impressions. It just didn't work for me on so many levels, plot, writing - like I don't know maybe in previous movies I didn't put that much attention to it, but here it just stand out that characters didn't speak to each other - all dialogue scenes where full of exposition, very inspired speeches and it was pushed to absurd like the ""board"" meeting with Denlinger or in the Club. I felt like the only actual human-to-human conversation was during the chase when Ethan was instructing Grace where to turn. 

Another thing - it's very often referenced as a spiritual successor to De Palma's first MI... I didn't get that feeling at all... yea it references it a lot, and it had Dutch angles, closeups, and Kittridge... but it's a very different kind of cinema - new MI it's a typical modern action movie - I you watched Bullet Train or Indiana Jones recently, you may feel like having a deja vu...  I did re-watched the first MI not that long ago and was genuinely surprised at how much of a spy thriller it really was, as I wrongly associated it only with the final train sequence, forgetting how awesome and grounded the rest was, and how good the build to that was. 

So didn't get the old MI vibe here - it's all chase and action... and apart from jumping from the cliff... which felt super forced btw... I didn't felt like it raises the bar, I've seen plenty of chase scenes, some better some worse, Bond, Indiana, all the Netflix kind action things... and the trains, oh man I just feel tired of train roof scenes I guess... like I feel this has been really over-exploited - there is nothing new they did with that - again, probably just watching Indiana Jones didn't help with that impression (chases where there too... a lot of them) and I get it -  it was MI reference - but again - in Brian's film it was something that stands out from the whole thing, it was a conclusion - here it was just yet another crazy action sequence after so many other action sequences. as a viewer I get fatigued.

Back to the jumping scene - apart from the fact, that for me was more thrilling watching those ""making off"" videos than the actual bit in the cinema - it was funny that the whole dialogue around that scene felt like some meta-comment on that, Ethan being confused on what he's doing really on that bike, and getting to that train like that doesn't make sense - and Benji was like I dunno man - just do you big stunt that the only place in that story where we make some use of it... yeah, it's stupid but I'm don't have better ideas, a lot is going on, no time for that :D Anyways - it was the first time when I felt that Tom's stunt was about Tom's stunt - where previously it felt always much more integrated. 

What else... dunno plot holes, even small things like the whole thing about the necessity of using analog technology, because of Entity... scene later has Benji driving an electric car using autonomous drive...  I was really waiting for Entity to take control over that BMW... but it turns out to be just a product placement, they need to inject that electric vehicle there. 

Gabriel... flat, and that's all I kind of write about the guy really. Out of nowhere Ethan's origin (no, it's not a flashback to Prague from the first MI as many people think it was)  that I just can't relate to, and after so many movies just felt forced (again, probably fatigued with the franchise bringing another ghost characters from the past like in Bond or F&F - at this point, I just hope it's not Ethan's brother :D ;)) 

Ilsa dead... oh boy... the whole bridge sequence - it was an amazing mixed bag of really cool build with great score moments, with Tom running through those streets mixed with a super awkward, mediocre boss fight sequence on that bridge between Gabriel and Grace, and later Ilsa. Such a great character deserves much much better - felt like she should just kick his ass... I think I'd even it would work better if it was a more grounded and sudden moment, The Departed style (Leo in the elevator) - not to mention the build-to-her death was a bit too much on the nose. 

And yeah it has some cool moments, appreciated the humor, the new female cast was superb (Pom and Hayley), and Fiat scenes were cool and genuinely funny but all those good stuff were overshadowed by bad stuff for me. So yeah - I think it's one of the worst if not the worst Mission Impossible experience for me. It hurts as I overall appreciate the series a lot - was for me much more consistent in quality than Craig's Bond series (which was all over the place, starting from brilliant Casino, somehow getting to awful Spectre)",2023-08-03 12:18:49
"I might be in the minority, but I've found this to be one of the weakest M:I movies to date. It had its moments and I wasnt really bored, but the movie really felt like someone thought of a lot a set pieces and characters, but forgot to write a good story around them.

The M:I films always had a lot of charm in its ""simplicity"". Tell a pretty simply, basic narrative with a small but great cast and pack that with amazing action set pieces. Dead Reckoning had so much going on and so many characters that I felt it forgot to make me care about the plot and those characters. 

Like, why is Grace even a character? Why is she needed when we had a perfectly great female character in Ilsa. Her death was totally wasted, it seemed like Hunt was over her 20 minutes after it happened.

The whole AI thing I really didn't feel and they tried so hard to make it sound like the most dangerous thing, but failed to do so imo. Let alone the Gabriel character and his French ""henchgirl"" who I couldnt care less about. I honestly don't know why Gabriel was in the movie and why Ethan's past suddenly became part of the story.

The score was amazing and I loved the whole train sequence. But it lacked so much lf the greatness Fallout and its prequels had, that I left the cinema dissappointed. I expected more.",2023-07-12 22:08:15
"Saw it on Sunday in an early screening since paramount is the one that mostly offers them to consumers. 

While not as good as Rogue Nation and Fallout, it‚Äôs still a great action film with some great sequences. 

The CGI and ‚ÄúCovid-effect‚Äù are minimal mostly a wonky green screen pickup like some brief shots of the climax. I did notice that both this and Indiana Jones had similar car chase and train sequences, wonder if there was some sort of competition between Disney and Paramount about how their sequences would be portrayed so close to each other. They also have similar budgets and were released two weeks near each other. 

Take it from a young guy who loves old people movies: this shit is top-tier. (I loved Indy 5, and even Little Mermaid 2023 got me to smile). M:I will firmly be the Film of the Year in AARP Magazine. And it deserves it. 

Not everyone may agree though - at a 3pm showing both someone next to me and someone behind me were loudly snoring during the film. That took out some of my suspense during the dialogue scenes, but dialogue isn‚Äôt really the franchise‚Äôs strong suit. More about feeling and intentions and zig zagging loyalties.",2023-07-12 02:42:56
"I will miss you, Ilsa",2023-07-13 22:37:10
"Honestly I like Fallout a lot better. The pacing here was too slow for a M:I movie. There were many scenes and sequences I felt overstayed their welcome. There was also a huge over reliance on close-ups, and poorly framed ones at that. So many dialogue scenes play out in nothing but close-ups, and not in a way that's invoking claustrophobia and paranoia. It's just non-stop close ups even when a scene isn't trying to be intense or dramatic. 

And the editing is really bizarre and distracting. Like they'll be on a close up of a character speaking, and then randomly in the middle of their sentence, they cut to ANOTHER close up from a slight different angle, with some equally wacky composition. And they do it like 20 times per conversation! It's so strange. Maybe I'm being too nitpicky here, but it really started distracting me.

I also gotta say, I don't really love the whole Skynet thing. Even with all the AI buzz lately, it felt too cartoonish for this franchise. And the human villains were super bland. They wanted this big emotional connecting with Gabriel, but you can't just shoehorn that in with a couple black and white flashbacks. You gotta earn that relationship for it to mean anything when they fight.

On that note, killing Ilsa and swapping her for Grace was a huge misstep. They've spent 3 movies building their relationship and it was the only thing in this franchise currently that feels really emotionally engaging. Now it's a new girl out of nowhere, right at the end? And if they end up doing a death fake out for Ilsa TWICE, that will be even more disappointing, honestly. I'd rather they just commit to it at this point.

To end on a positive note, I really loved the final train escape sequence as it's falling off the track. That was really thrilling and unique!",2023-07-15 05:45:47
"I liked the movie a lot, but they should have brought Thandiwe Newton back as the master thief.",2023-07-17 04:31:59
"First one I didn't like. Horrible dialogue, repeating the same things about the entity over and over again. No chemistry between the characters. Was just exhausted and bored by the end of the movie. This one needed to go through the writers' room 10 more times. Show, don't tell.",2023-07-17 15:03:12
"MI: Dead Reckoning Part One has been one of my most anticipated movies of this year. But does it live up to the hype? In my opinion in ways it does but in other ways this falls short compared to MI: Fallout. 

To start off on the good and what I liked about this. Tom Cruise man. You have to give him his props. Say what you want about him but there‚Äôs no denying the guy has a passion for the movie making experience and does everything he can to entertain the audience in the best way possible. Seeing him jump off a cliff on a motorcycle (and knowing he actually did that) was crazy to me. I also liked Esai Morales and the overall artificial intelligence villain this movie had. I thought it was timely especially with how things are today in the world. A few more things I liked here were both Hayley Atwell and Vanessa Kirby. This is arguably Atwell‚Äôs best role to date she was great here and was able to hold her own opposite Cruise. It was also great to see Vanessa Kirby reprise her role from Fallout and she has more to do here thankfully and you could tell she had fun essentially playing a double role here. Hopefully we‚Äôll get more of her in Part 2. Also was a big fan of the entire train sequence it reminded me of Uncharted 2. 


Now to move on to the negatives. Why the hell would you kill off the Illsa Faust character? When she ‚Äúdied‚Äù the first time I was dumbfounded but later in the movie when she actually died I was just as upset. If this was the plan from the start then what was the point of having her continue on after Rouge Nation? I don‚Äôt know if at the time this was filming Rebecca Ferguson was also busy with Dune Part 2 or her Silo AppleTV+ series and that factored in the decision. Or McQuarrie felt like he couldn‚Äôt develop Atwell‚Äôs character properly with Ferguson still around and if that is the case I completely disagree. Why couldn‚Äôt we have three badass women kicking ass here in Kirby, Ferguson and Atwell? Just a mind boggling decision all around. Hope she somehow returns in Part 2. What I also wasn‚Äôt a fan of was Pom Klementieff‚Äôs role here as a voiceless assassin until her character is on death‚Äôs door and she blurts out three lines of dialogue in another language. Her role here is equivalent to Dave Bautista‚Äôs in Spectre and I thought that was lame because it just felt like a waste of another capable and good actress. Also not really a fan of splitting big blockbusters in two parts either. I know this isn‚Äôt anything new but now it seems like every major studio is doing it. First with Dune, then Fast and Furious and Spider-Verse and now this. Not sure if I‚Äôm a fan of it.

Overall while this isn‚Äôt as good as Fallout in my opinion. This is still highly enjoyable and will likely be in my top ten for the year. Definitely looking forward to Part 2 next year and it‚Äôs definitely between this and John Wick: Chapter 4 for best action movie of the year for me. That is unless Gareth Evans next movie ‚ÄúHavoc‚Äù ends up releasing this year.",2023-07-12 14:27:20
"Liked the movie a lot ‚Ä¶ real fun, but I felt Rebecca Ferguson‚Äôs character was well underbaked this movie.",2023-07-13 12:22:23
"It was FANTASTIC!!! Sometimes funny, super exciting, and surprisingly very intense at times ... 

Cruise running to try to get to Ilsa in time had me on the edge of my seat. 

I still can't believe she's gone.

The jokes poking fun. I love when the MI series can laugh at itself. 

Atwell is a great addition to the cast and had a great dynamic with Ethan.

There were so many set pieces that I loved --- the car chase scene being one of them.  

Such an enjoyable ride.  

I love the MI series and will be rewatching this one many times.",2023-07-14 04:02:04
That hug between Ethan and Ilsa was the cutest thing ever,2023-07-14 12:23:50
"Luther and Ilsa are 100% teaming up behind the scenes. Only way to win is for them to be playing without any of the other characters, including The Entity, knowing they are.

Remember her death was based of it's calculations, not destiny. Hunt needs to think she is dead for the play to work.",2023-07-15 14:12:12

Could've been trimmed 30 min. Also ilsa barely had any dialogue but her death was sad considering shes been in the last 3. Overall I enjoyed it though the plot seems kind of meh compared to the last few. Nothing can top the last 3 imo. They were very well made,2023-07-17 00:22:45
"My second least favorite MI movie. It just felt so disjointed compared to the last three movies. Who thought it was a good idea to go FF route and try to re-write or add to Ethan's origin story? Gabriel is a terrible villain and it kind of reminded me when they added John Cena's character to FF movies. Even the action scenes weren't that impressive compared to the last three movies. Then they had the audacity to kill off Ilsa for some dumb reason. Overall, I expected a lot more from what was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year. Hopefully part 2 will be a much better movie.",2023-07-17 21:15:20
"So the ever present AI antagonist was an edgy windows screensaver and the human puppet baddie was just... there. Okay. They could have learnt how to show to your audience a godlike AI if they watched a few scenes of Person of Interest, the screensaver and transformers sounds were laughable.

They didn't show up how they did retrieve the keys in the first place and filled all the holes  with exposition. The action scenes as always were nice but I think this is one of the weakest antagonist and plots.",2023-07-21 09:00:15

"Why is everyone jacking off this movie so hard????

There were so many exposition heavy scenes where the main characters would just go on and on about wtf was going on. Talk about disrespecting the audience much and wasting banji and Luther‚Äôs character. 

Isla fausts death was so nonchalant too, isn‚Äôt she one of the main characters at this point?? I get that this is an MI movie but there were way too many fucking deus ex machinas that it took me out completely. 

Also so many Dutch angle shots. Why?

5/10 honestly huge step down - the train scene at the end was cool though",2023-07-12 18:21:30
"1. Ilsa's death took me out. i've mentioned this elsewhere, but it really felt like a nothing death, so unearned and very unmourned. And the cut to the next scene where Grace is for some reason styled like Ilsa feels like single white female replacement vibes. Ilsa's plotline in general is just ???  considering the setup at the end of Fallout which implies she might join the IMF. Why is she still disavowed and on her own???
2. McQ says Grace was intentionally written as a character not meant for the MI series and it \*shows\*. Dislike that she becomes a damsel in distress after a rather strong start. And if you know you're a terrible knife fighter, why aren't you running away? The film really wants me to like her and I'm... not feeling it.
3. Paris is AMAZING. I hope she joins the team since she's way more field-ready than Grace.
4. We went from not fridging anyone, to two fridges (Marie in the flashbacks, Ilsa)... wow.  don't really understand the retcon of Ethan's past to being a criminal (very vibes of Napoleon Solo in MUNCLE).
5. Way too much exposition. And everyone having a follow-up line. It just sounds super scripted, or in context of the film, super rehearsed. Seems like the script wants to sound clever but it isn't.
6. This doesn't rate above Fallout and Rogue Nation. What are the critics smoking?",2023-07-12 08:16:00
"Great movie, it was very fun to watch and I didn't feel like I was left empty at the end like most 2 part movies seem to do. The best thing I can say about the movie is that Ethan felt like the weakest (not physically) character in it and that's not an insult towards Tom Cruise",2023-07-12 02:14:30
It was nice of Tom Cruise to rescue Rebecca Ferguson from Arrakis.,2023-07-12 04:16:37
If I were Paramount I‚Äôd have given Isla Faust her own movie with her own team >!instead of killing her off to mine pathos for Ethan Hunt!<.,2023-07-12 13:17:50
"Honestly, it felt very‚Ä¶average. Definitely weaker compared to fallout and rogue nation. Action scenes were fantastic like usual, but the writing was just all over the place.

The villain just felt off for some reason. I get that he‚Äôs a throwback to the first movie but I just didn‚Äôt feel threatened by him. He felt like a classic bad guy goon rather than the main antagonist. 

Then there was Isla‚Äôs death. This one was clearly foreshadowed throughout the beginning of the movie, but it still just didn‚Äôt sit well with me. She was one of the main characters the past 2 movies and then gets an anticlimactic death scene? Come on. Not to mention it barely affected Ethan and the rest of the gang! We see one shot of Ethan sad by a railing and then it‚Äôs back to business as usual. 

After that, we are expected to all of a sudden like Ethan and Grace together? It felt really rushed. Grace consistently tried to sneak away from Ethan. But now Ethan and Grace are super close? 

Regarding the ending, I just didn‚Äôt feel hyped for the next part whatsoever. Ethan won. He got the key and knows the location of the sub. It honestly should have ended with Gabriel winning and ending up with the upper hand. This just felt‚Ä¶boring. 

Here‚Äôs hoping part 2 kicks it up a notch. Also, I couldn‚Äôt help but think the AI was the same from the show Mrs. Davis if anyone has seen that.",2023-07-12 20:11:38

"Questions:

Why did Cary Elwes DNI think he had any leverage over Gabriel? I missed that. Why did he expect anything other than just being killed? It didn't come across as a surprise to me but I might have missed something in the dialogue that would have made it more twisty.

Kittredge's monologue/voiceover at the end. Was that the same voice as the beginning that was on Ethan's tape? Or was the opening voiceover different than the tape? If it was on the tape: weird, because the tape self-destructed, so are these new words from a second tape?

I kind of suspect there's some stuff that will be reinterpreted in the second movie. That'd be cool. Where we think we've seen one thing, but it turns out it was something else... explained in an entirely separate movie.",2023-07-12 06:46:40
"Where to start... I'm a big fan of the franchise and was really looking forward to this one. Having seen it in Imax last night, I could not wait for it to be over. It has amazing action scenes, but overall it was about an hour too long. It really needed trimming.

The visualisation of ""The Entity"" was hilariously bad, it looked like a 2008 Windows Media Player Visualiser. Gabriel not communicating onscreen with The Entity was a huge miss. How cool would it have been if he had an earpiece and the AI was giving him real-time instructions. Now it was something lame like, I have prepared for a thousand outcomes (him jumping off the train onto a truck was so stupid). 

No idea why they introduced Grace when you have Rebecca Ferguson there. She literally could've done all the things Grace did. 

The fact it's 3 hours long and only the first part of a two-parter is WILD to me. This franchise doesn't need a 6 hour movie for such a simple story...",2023-07-12 08:14:58
The sunken submarine at the bottom of the ocean is very bad timing.,2023-07-12 19:30:33
"Some complaints:

\-Ilsa is almost certainly not dead, but I think they could have made it more believable.  (Evidence:  Right before the venice party seen, Ethan was told he needs to think like a computer, so taking Ilsa off the chessboard makes the most sense.  Also, Ilsa had a fake out death earlier.  Also Furgeson is cast in Part 2.  Also Benji is the one who had the fake bomb foreshadowing that his personal info will be weaponized.  Also her deciding to fake off herself makes a lot of the plot holes make a bit more sense (Why nobody mourns her death, why Grace seemingly faced Gabriel for no reason, why he was told not to deviate from the mission)

\-I'm not sure why Gabriel is a superspy villain, if Ethan and Gabriel crossed paths before Ethan was part of IMF then Gabriel should really only be a street level criminal.  Also, why does Gabriel have such a hatred of Ethan?  Maybe all of this will be explained better in the next movie.  IMO he should have just been a unknown, new villain.  This would actually clean up a lot of plot holes and make Ilsa's death actually feel more like an emotional weight on Ethan.

\-Grace's motivations the entire movie seemed bizarre.  I get not wanting to give the key away in the airport (But even then, who was she going to sell it to?)  But after Rome she 100% should have realized ""Yeah, this whole thing is definitely over my head, I should definitely trust this Ethan guy who so far is the only one who isn't trying to kill me.""  Venice should not have happened the way it did, and I have no idea why she was going to kill Gabriel (Unless Gabriel intercepted her escape?  But why if he assumed the Widow was going to do good on her end?  Couldn't really tell.)  Also at the end, not entirely sure why she didn't just take the money, might as well have even if you planned on double crossing the US government.

\-Benji using autopilot for his car even though the entire plot of the movie is that there is an evil AI trying to take over the world that is untraceable and untouchable and can control any technology.  I was almost certain that there would be repercussions for doing this... but no.

\-Personal gripe but I don't like 'super pickpocketing' as a trope.  Pickpocketing is actually incredibly difficult, even more so when the person you're trying to pickpocket is aware that you're going to try it.  They did it a lot in this movie and treated it almost like a super power, nobody ever failed at it and it was always too clean.  This one is more of a personal gripe though.

Other than that, pretty much loved it.  There are a few complaints that can probably be explained in part 2 but I am wary that Grace will be better fleshed out as a character and it's going to take a lot for me to buy that Gabriel is as competent as he is considering who he should be.  Honestly I wouldn't doubt if there is a 3.5 hour cut or 4 hour cut that better explains some stuff and adds a bit more to some of the scenes that had awkward pacing.",2023-07-13 03:01:10

"Did anyone think the writing / plot to this movie was cheesy as hell?

Look, I know it's been critically acclaimed by critics and fans, but I couldn't stop to think it was almost parodying itself in some ways as well.  
The way-too-long scene where Kittridge and cronies are explaining the AI to Denlinger by saying ONE SENTENCE AT A TIME to form a GIANT STORY, as if its some improv warm-up you'd do in class, just made me laugh out loud because of how long it overstayed its welcome. Also, who is that good at talking?!  
Which is interesting because that shitty writing is diffused (pun intended), by awesome natural moments like in the car chase scene and the chemistry / awkward pitter-patter between Ethan and Grace.  
But the whole plot of there being an AI, the threat just didn't seem real. Like, what even is the threat? So , a sub blew up? Great. We didn't really see anything else this AI is capable of, its just some menace in the background and is personified via Gabriel, who we are supposed to care about because of a quick flashback?  
I don't understand Gabriel's power either? He's not a bionic super-villain, hes just a regular guy indoctrinated by a computer talking to him i guess? It's not like he has super fighting ability or has downloaded 'the future' into his brain. His monologue in the club of the AI knowing everything thats going to happen is downright silly. He could have just been bullshitting. The AI could have been a screensaver on the background.  
Also, when Gabriel emerges from the luggage in the train, he has a, what I assume is oxygen mask with the AI on it? At first I thought he was bionic and this thing was programming him in that moment, but what the hell was the point of that mask?  
Everything just seemed really paint by numbers in terms of a 'big threat', and writing 'twists', like a hand off gone wrong and this person will double cross you! I don't know, it seemed phoned in for me.  
Also, the whole macguffin with getting this key for something nobody knows what it does, seemed pretty pointless.  
I would have wanted to see the AI launch a nuke and destroy a country and have the stakes be REAL. But it seemed like we were just supposed to trust the fear imbued in everyone in this film. This whole thing could be a ruse.",2023-07-12 16:42:33

They honestly could of cut a few unnecessary scenes, made others much shorter and made this into 1 movie and gone 3hours in length. However, the cliff jump scene was really awesome but still, a 6/10 for me.",2023-07-12 03:00:03

"Not as good as Fallout for me personally. But still, it was a really fun ride. Runtime of 2 and a half hours went by so quickly. 

I just felt Fallout was a bit tighter with the narrative whereas this one got a bit wonky with the whole Gabriel character introduced in a like 10 second flashback sequence. 

Lots of people talking about the train sequence (and with good reason, it was awesome) but I think my favorite set piece was the airport one. Luther deepfaking Ethan's face onto random people to throw the CIA guys off the scent, the cat and mouse with Ethan and Grace, Benji defusing the fake bomb.

"I‚Äôve seen the last four Mission: Impossibles on opening weekend, it has quietly become one of my favorite franchises. And I‚Ä¶ was disappointed.

My girl Ilsa didn‚Äôt deserve to go out like that. I‚Äôve recently seen a lot of criticisms about other big franchises killing off their strong female characters as a means of making their leading men feel bad. I could see the blog post as the fight on the bridge went on. If they wanted her out they should have given her the exit Julia got in *Fallout*.

Hayley Atwell is charming and a great addition to the cast, I can‚Äôt figure out for the life of me why Ethan chooses to trust her so much. In my opinion handcuffing him to the steering wheel may as well have been attempted murder and now *he has to choose between her and Ilsa??* Honestly same with Pom: Ethan kills henchmen all the time, when Pom asks why she was spared I really wanted him to answer. The only assumption I have is that he doesn‚Äôt kill women.

Bike stunt was underwhelming. I know that‚Äôs such a keyboard warrior thing to say and I know how much work/risk goes into this stuff, but it just wasn‚Äôt as cinematic as other big ‚Äúposter‚Äù MI stunts. (Train on the bridge sequence was peak MI though).

But most of all, I was just bored a lot. It seemed like so much of the runtime was exposition, planning, tense speeches‚Ä¶ this one took a long time to really get going. I wasn‚Äôt really engaged until the airport scene.

Hoping that now the pieces are set and Part II hammers it home, but I think this one‚Äôs a 6/10 for me and MI is usually a personal 8-9.",2023-07-13 07:29:15

"Saw this 2 days ago and it was phenomenal.

Fallout still remains the best, but this was up there with Rogue Nation level of greatness.

The only thing that stops it from reaching Fallout's GOAT status is the pacing and overly-packed story (which will elevate the film on a re-watch). Some people also might not like what they did with a certain character, although I thought it worked within the context of the story.

The train sequence alone was worth the ticket price and the action in this was again out of this world.

Hayley Atwell was a refreshing addition to the cast and she did great, especially in the second half of the film.

Balfe composed another amazing soundtrack as well and I can't get over how good the opening 20 mins were, leading to the titles sequence.

In addition, the decision to change cinematographers and shoot digital, the signature De Palma Dutch angles (M:I 1 vibes) and the beautiful set locations, made for some truly spectacular cinematography. It has an orange/brownish tint, but not as strong as the yellow tint that ran through Rogue Nation or the heavy blacks present in Fallout.

In other words - it will look stunning in 4K.

The wait for Part 2 will be long. Especially with how they've set up the villain of the film.

I liked the movie a lot but was very disappointed with what happened with Ilsa, however, here‚Äôs my theory for the time being: She‚Äôs not dead. We know the IMF repeatedly uses the same tricks to deceive others (think mask infiltration) to achieve their goals. In Rogue Nation, Brandt is led to believe Julia had been murdered as a way to protect her identity from bad actors. Now what if Ethan found Ilsa on that bridge and we didn‚Äôt see him discovering she had a pulse? They could keep her existence hidden as a major wild card against The Entity in Dead Reckoning - Part Two. We know The Entity relies on predictability to stay ahead of Ethan and Co., so having any kind of wild card would be necessary to defeat it. That, and I believe this was foreshadowed when we were momentarily led to believe that Paris was dead until Degas checked her pulse after Ethan had escaped. Call it wishful thinking, but I think it could be a cool twist when we get Part Two next year.",2023-07-14 15:40:06

That‚Äôs why Luther disappears at the end of the movie and doesn‚Äôt seem sad about Ilsa at all. 

There‚Äôs a couple giveaways IMO: 

-The first scene where Ilsa appears she fakes her death and the camera aims at her on the floor, similar to how she lays on the bridge. 

-Ilsa suddenly appears on the boat without Ethan knowing, implying her and Luther have been in contact without telling Ethan.",2023-07-15 23:52:51
"I didn't understand why Ethan is the only one who had to do a tom cruise level stunt to get on to the train in the climax when every other character gets onto it with relatively lot less effort??Paris gets onto it by 'simply' jumping off a bridge and then unlocks the container carrying Gabriel which is somehow already inside the train.

The CIA agent duo get on the train and it seemed like other compartments even have ordinary civilians. so if white widow's henchmen checked every passenger who boarded the train at the station, they must have still stopped grace considering her disguise doesn't work because they would know she isn't their boss.

Also Benji is using what I assume to be a laptop(which can breached by the entity since luther said he only modified the comms)fr guiding Ethan onto the train. So I was expecting them to acknowledge or realise that the entity was making it harder for Ethan to get on to the train by misleading them or something, but it never happened. 

I can understand that Tom cruise probably made the writers write the climax around that stunt after coming up with it and of course the stunt itself extremely impressive but it could have been fit into the narrative with little more grace. It is also publicised so much, so as soon as he got onto that bike, you would be waiting for that stunt scene and every time it cut to him, trying to catch up to the train, you know it isn't going to work, which made the scene feel dragged out. Although I actually liked the landing part since it embraces the absurdity and dumb luck involved in Ethan's missions which I guess isn't an opinion I would share with many people.",2023-07-16 12:34:26

"They got such a great cast of ladies in this movie, I'm very happy with all of the different energies they brought to this film.  Pom was so fierce and and crazy, I loved her looks.

That said, I'm super disappointed by the way that they killed off Ilsa.  MI Rogue Nation is my favourite of the series, mainly because of Ilsa.  She's the only female character where I felt like there was real chemistry between her and Hunt, because she's not just a romantic interest, she's truly his equal when it comes to spy craft.  There's a lot of betrayals in MI, with a focus on how coldly governments use or discard their agents.  But what really brought that home for me was experiencing it with Elsa when her superior wiped her drive so that she had no way to come home.  Ilsa and Hunt really feel like kindred spirits sometimes, and the scene where she asks him if he would leave with her at the end of MI5 was probably the most emotionally resonant this series has been for me.

The way that her character story played out this film felt like they just wanted to fridge her so they can replace her with Grace.  I'm really baffled how choosing between Ilsa and Grace is supposed to be difficult for Hunt.  On one end you have someone who he has known for several years and is probably romantically involved with, on the other end is someone he's met for like 2 days that's refused to cooperate with him every step of the way.  

The fight between her and Gabriel was also ridiculous, not only because of the terrible sword choreography, but also because Grace, who is not supposed to have any special training, seemed to hold up around the same as Ilsa against him.  (Also, can someone explain why Gabriel didn't kill Grace after he killed Ilsa??)

And if she really had to die that way, I was hoping for something more emotionally poignant than what we were left with.  Bringing back some Nessun Dorma in the score would have been such a great callback to when we first met her.",2023-07-18 02:08:27
"there is absolutely no way in hell ilsa is dead. by that point in the movie they know the entity is able to predict things that are going to play out. i think it's a misdirection to fool the entity into thinking she's dead meanwhile she's MIA and only hunt knows she's not dead. if the entity knows all then hunt can't risk letting benji and luther in on the fact that she's actually alive and is going to be used by hunt in someway to eventually dispose of the entity. 

unless rebecca ferguson absolutely told them she was finished and to end her story in this one so she can focus on idk dune or silo? i mean dune 2 is already in the can. silo just ended and i haven't read anything about them filming season 2 in the near future. 

absolutely no way on god's green earth is ilsa dead. 

agree with so many people saying it was a homage and spiritual successor to MI 1. it 1000 percent was. i was a little confused by the start because it didn't flow like the last 3 did but once you sort of realize you are watching the spiritual successor to MI 1 it made a shit load of sense.

You could make the same argument for MI: Fallout, but at least they had a charasmatic villain (two villains no less!) So I was engaged in what happened. This time round they had an under baked antagonist who I didn't fully get the motivations of, and an AI who felt (understandably) like a background presence rather than a genuine threat. I hope the second part wraps it all up nicely, but I really feel this could have done with either some serious editing to make the pace quicker, or it it has to be that long, development of the characters, as there were just too many for me to really care about!",2023-07-20 19:20:49

"Holy shit, this movie was comedically terrible. This movie demands you have no brain, and have literally zero expectations for any sort of quality writing. The dialogue in the movie is just an explanation of what is about to happen, with not a single normal conversation. The plot completely disregards any sense of reality, and as such, apart from the visuals, there's nothing left. The soundtrack is terrible, just a random assortment of orchestral noise at various volumes for dramatic effect. The plot just randomly moves from set piece to set piece, making up reasons to be there as it goes along, with exposition every 30 seconds. Perhaps ironically, the movie itself seems like it could have been made by an AI. The costume design is hilariously bad, with the female characters looking like they robbed various disney characters for their costumes.

"I think Ilsa should have been given a better ending.  I‚Äôd rather have Ethan‚Äôs wife get killed than Ilsa as she was dead weight to the story anyway. It would have made the intentions of the entity very clear. And both Ilsa and Ethan could have avenged the death together. And then in the process Ilsa‚Äôs death would have deepened the intensity.

Grace‚Äôs character was clearly forced into the movie and didn‚Äôt make any sense to me. I could have managed having her without the need to kill Ilsa.",2023-07-12 19:07:03
"It was Entertainment, but there were certainly flaws. The river CGI during the train scene was noticeable. Gabriel is just not as intimidating. I would have rather they did something with Angela Bassett's character. Ilsa's death was not handled properly. They moved on so quickly. Her presence will be missed.

Having the AI as the villain was cool, but at the same time I felt like they were pretty much imitating Person of Interest or Westworld season 3. I also felt it was really out of character for Pom Klementieff‚Äòs character to save Ethan‚Äôs life at the end when she was basically shown to be a psychopath the entire film. Anyway, it still had a lot of good moments, particularly the fiat chase scene.",2023-07-15 14:49:37

Am I missing something or did thr White Widow's own brother not notice that her eye color changed? I found this so distracting that nobody noticed her eyes were no longer blue.,2023-07-17 06:22:05
"Honestly, the more I've thought about Gabriel, the more it's bothered me the way they just jammed him into Ethan's backstory in the laziest way possible. We're at, what... MI:7? Where has Gabriel been the past thirty years? Just wandering the globe, waiting for a self-aware AI to be invented? He's apparently bad-ass enough that Ilsa knew his name and that he's some sort of agent of chaos, and the White Widow feared him so much she nearly bugged out when he threatened her, but none of the rest of them even knew he existed except Ethan who only knew his face from thirty years ago and had no idea who he was. Maybe if they had had amazing foresight to plant Esai Morales into the background of certain scenes every single movie before this, so that it's revealed he's been behind everything this entire time for YEARS, then there'd be some rationale to the dread everyone acts with upon revealing him. But as it stands, he's little more than some smooth-looking guy who acts tough and makes threats but really just comes out of nowhere.

They should have set him up as an unknown that the AI has established as its voice, who speaks for it and does as it demands, but is a complete mystery to everyone who he is. It would make his actions more surprising, you don't know why he does what he does except that he is told to. He's mean and strong, surprisingly talented enough of a fighter to outdo Ilsa AND Grace on the bridge, and even gives Ethan a run for his money.

Ethan didn't need the sledgehammered backstory of how he joined the IMF. The idea that this guy Gabriel killed someone and set him up for murder is annoying. For one thing, there was no reason to make it that Ethan had to join the IMF for that, and that he's actually innocent... they make it clear that everyone joins the IMF as a choice because they did something bad, why does Ethan have to be the odd one out? And second, if Gabriel is such a terror to everyone in the spy network, despite having VANISHED for 30 years after stabbing some rando woman in an alley, wouldn't they KNOW Gabriel did it? And why would they want to hire Ethan based off that one murder?

I had a great time at the movie, but the whole Gabriel and Ethan backstory thing just bugs the shit out of me.",2023-07-17 16:32:25
"Is Ilsa the first character to die in the MI series that has appeared in more than one movie?

Absolutely brutal death for my favorite characters in the series...quite enjoyed the movie, felt like a great mix of the original's spy focus with modern stunts and action, but even though Grace was great, she was definitely more of a damsel than Ilsa and it definitely feels like a downgrade.

I understand if Ferguson had scheduling issues, but just cutting her out of the movie after her desert scene and letting her live as a ghost would have been much more preferable.",2023-07-18 04:34:02
"Anyone else love that at the party, Gabriel said that ""tomorrow the key will be laid by my feet"", then on the train, it's literally on the floor at his feet as he picks it up!",2023-07-18 10:13:25
"After relatively airtight plots of MI 4,5 and 6 this was jarring. So after killing Ilsa, gabriel just leaves grace alone on the bridge with half the key? Dafuq?? He could have captured and tortured her to obtain the key AND killed vanessa kirby to get the other key instead of dealing with all this drudgery. What use was the entity's precognition powers except to erase cctv footage? i was expecting gabriel to have an earpiece and more hired goons because the entity could steal cash and outsource anonymously. Btw if the entity wanted to protect itself, why not just have gabriel DESTROY the key or even just half the key to lock out the sub or takeover another sub and shoot out a torpedo to completely destroy sevastopol??? The entity is so focused on people's emotions that it missed the easiest path to obtain its goal- the quality a cold calculating machine should have had. They hyped up the motor jump but we didn't see him steering towards the train. Lame-o compared to hanging off the burj kalifa, a plane or even the motorcycle chase. I hope they were saving their load for part two because this is ranked below MI 4,5,6",2023-07-18 15:46:41
"Mixed feelings for me but ultimately a bit of a disappointment. 

The good - most of the action was well done. Some things were over the top and stretched believability (i.e. the whole parachuting through the side of the train at the exact right moment etc.) but I'm willing to roll with it for the most part. I thought the performances of most of the main cast were pretty good.

The bad - The writing and plot was just awful, imo. I'm not even the type of person that needs a perfect plot with no holes in my blockbusters, but this one was just bad. The exposition-heavy scenes with extreme closeups and overly dramatic line reading was so cringe. People don't talk that way. The idea for the story (AI and its effect on society) is prescient but the execution was nonsense, and calling it ""the entity"" instead of AI was just dumb. It also didn't affect the story enough. In something like Terminator, the Terminator is relentless and seemingly everywhere all the time, and the characters always have that hanging over their heads. Here, the influence of the AI only seems to be important when they need it for a particular moment in an action sequence rather than influencing every decision they make. They should be worried about dealing with AI's influence on their perception of reality (and trying to mitigate it) literally all the time. 

The character of Gabriel was also a 2D bad guy. Again, he's essentially a human terminator-like character who should be scary but I didn't get any real sense of it aside from being told it at first, and I have no idea what his motivations or goals are, aside from just being the bad guy. I did like Pom Klementieff as his henchwoman, even though she basically had no lines. Her death scene was idiotic, however. How did she get from the room on the train car where she was stabbed, to the dangling car Ethan and Grace were in with a gaping wound in her gut, on the verge of death, AND manage to pull them both up from the brink of death. Nonsense. Ultimately, I could have dealt with that if the rest had been good but it just wasn't. 

Finally, it was too long. It could have had at least 20 minutes cut out by tightening up the dialogue, eliminating one of the chases, and/or having one less plunging train car.",2023-07-19 16:36:24
"I feel like I just don't connect with these films as much as the majority of people. Obviously at its core, it's an action film, I'm not expecting it to be the most insane narrative of all time but I just felt that was incredibly plain, cliche and a bit of a drag. The constant close of shots of every characters face whilst they spend 10 minutes just explaining the plot is so exhausting. The stunts were very cool of course but I just didn't feel like it was enough to justify the bland parts of the film.",2023-07-20 06:27:28
"As I think others have already said, the meeting of the agency heads was just painful to sit through. They were more robotic than the damn AI.",2023-07-20 16:37:53
"This felt like Chatgpt wrote it. The entity was ""Sauron"" and the ""key"" was the ring. At times it also felt like a parody of itself with unintended comical moments at times being funnier than intended comic relief. The syndicate was an excellent antagonist force in the last couple but this antagonist really fell flat. Some great action scenes towards the end, but it doesn't make up for a poor plot and the ham-fisted introduction of a new female co-lead.",2023-07-21 02:39:46
"I feel like I'm in the minority with this take but I did not enjoy this movie as much as I expected to.

Now, I understand the intentions behind the homage to Brian De Palma and the original Mission Impossible in 1996. They recreating many scenes from the original like Ethan sneaking into the CIA, running through narrow European streets at night to save a team member, arriving just after she's been killed, flashback scenes to hint at the mission's failure, fighting on the roof of trains, and the use of dozens of dutch angles in (practically) every other shot. However, despite these well-executed nods, Dead Reckoning suffered significantly for me in terms of its writing, characters, and loopholes.

&#x200B;

Characters: Gabriel felt underdeveloped as a character. I appreciate the attempt at fleshing out Ethan‚Äôs pre-MI days, but giving me a 5 second clip simply announcing that it‚Äôs Ethan‚Äôs old nemesis without anything else added at all was a bit rough.It's truly disheartening how Rebecca's character met her end. Choosing between a woman you love and someone you just met a couple of days ago isn't a real dilemma and felt forced due to poor writing. Moreover, the aftermath of Rebecca's death didn't have the impact I anticipated. It seemed like her character was somewhat neglected, as if she was just a plot device to advance the story. Considering the history her character had with Ethan, she deserved a more fitting and respectful exit.

&#x200B;

Writing: The writing as a whole felt lazy. Luther explaining what might happen in the train felt like it fell out of a first semester college student‚Äôs backpack. The odd expository dialogue chunks in the first half could have used a couple more drafts. The government people explaining the AI felt like they used basic Chat GPT to write the script about next level AI. The ‚ÄúShoot her!‚Äù line was the icing on the cake for me! WHY DO YOU TELL SOMEONE ELSE TO SHOOT HER WHEN YOU YOURSELF HAVE YOUR HAND ON THE TRIGGER?

&#x200B;

Loopholes: Too many loopholes holes. Does the entity simply desire to nuke the submarine because it holds its only weakness? Why didn‚Äôt Gabriel immediately try to destroy the key when he found it? Why doesn't the AI just launch a few nukes at where the sub is? Why can‚Äôt this god-level AI figure out the location of the sub?

&#x200B;

I did enjoy the many action sequences but as a whole I felt this would have been more enjoyable as a tighter script and a whole hour shorter.",2023-07-21 03:09:27
"Did anyone else think it was complete garbage how they killed of Isla? I feel like behind Ethan, she was the most prominent character of the franchise.

If they dont bring her back for part two, im going to be seriously annoyed.

Also, is it just me or was Ethan very subdued in his reaction to her death.",2023-07-21 07:30:57
"Overall thought this was a very ""middle of the pack to Lower echelon"" MI movie for me.


The train sequence was awesome, but the whole notion of Grace meaning something to hunt vs Ilsa Faust was silly.",2023-07-23 06:30:39
"Overall, I enjoyed the movie but left pretty disappointed. Definitely felt like a step back from the previous movies. 

Off the top of my head, main issues: 

1. The entity being the villain. This felt like boomers trying to tap into AI fears but totally failing to do so in a cohesive way. Overall, way too amorphous (hence having to use Gabriel as a representative). Why couldn‚Äôt the AI just kill Ethan (or anyone)? Instead it throws a party and shows up as a strobing light (lol)

2. The nuclear bomb at the airport giving Benji random riddles and super deep questions like ‚Äúare you afraid of death?‚Äù in order to learn more about him. Set aside the ‚Äúentity‚Äù creating this, the entire concept of it learning about him through those questions was laughable. 

3. The two special agents that spent the entire movie chasing Ethan. They always felt like a convenient plot device, never characters that actually mattered to the story. 

4. Action scenes were great but it seemed like they were trying to shoe horn as many cool scenes into the movie as possible. I get it, it‚Äôs an action movie but you run the risk of turning into a fast and furious movie when you force in action scenes at the expense of plot.",2023-07-25 00:21:11
"Things I liked:

- Action was top-notch, even if the chase scenes didn't feel as cleanly photographed as in Fallout.  Dead Reckoning pt. 1 felt half as long as it actually was.

- There was a LOT of physical comedy punctuating the action. Cruise and Atwell swapping spots in the car was brilliantly done.

- The final sequence, when the heroes are racing against the train as it plummets one car at a time, was brilliantly done.  It wasn't just ""run!"", ""jump!"", ""phew we made it!""

- Despite all the moving parts and opposing parties, everyone's motivation in this movie made perfect sense, which is no small feat.

Things I didn't like:

- Fridging Ilsa. It was the worst kind of fridging: killing a character who matters not just to the hero, but to the audience.  It completely undermines the final exchange in Fallout.  Is that really it for the character?  Did we really get such an awful development because of scheduling conflicts?  Why even include the bit about Gabriel killing Ethan's old flame if they were forced to kill Ilsa too?

- The plot felt a *lot* less cohesive than Fallout's, and much less in service of the action's tension.  Having everyone pickpocketing the key from each other basically became, ""who needs to have the MacGuffin in their pocket to set up the next action sequence.""

- I understand the claustrophobia inherent in the alleyway fight, but I wish we'd been able to see more of Pom Klementieff in action.

- ""The entity"" is such a mouthful. They couldn't come up with anything to make the dialogue surrounding the antagonist less awkward?

- Gabriel's ""KHAAAAAN"" moment and `DECRYPTING BLOCKCHAIN`. Really?

- Fridging Ilsa.  Yes, I'm incredibly sour about this.

Dead Reckoning pt. 1 was great, but it's starting to look like Fallout was lightning in a bottle.  That movie worked on a level that DR1 couldn't quite replicate.  I'm interested to see where DR2 goes...I'm just bit less interested than I'd be if Ilsa were still in the picture.",2023-07-26 06:54:01
"Good movie and fun concept since sci fi is becoming real today. Fallout was better. I think Ghost Protocol is better also. I rank this as third now, so that pushes Rogue Nation to forth for me. Spoilers below.

The cinematography was a massive downgrade in this film after Fallout. I was expecting more of the same. I figured the series had hit its stride with Christopher McQuarrie directing. But with the DOP change... and I guess the directing... it felt far less mature, grand, and epic. Certainly compared to Fallout... but even to Rogue Nation. The endless Dutch angles, which I've always disliked, coming after Fallout which basically had none... just wasn't cool. The lighting and action camera work wasn't at the level of Fallout. 

In terms of the action itself, the Italy chase was fun, and I always enjoy a massive vehicle chasing as smaller vehicle in movies (T2 canal scene huge truck vs dirt bike for example) but the Paris chases in Fallout where just better shot, and the goofy Fiat, while humorous actual detracted from the scene because of that humor. The train sequence, in particular after the bridge explosion and the climbing up the train cars... one by one as gravity pulls them... as fantastic. I didn't like how Hunt just exploded into the train for an accidently saving of Grace.

The character development (which the series has frequently made an after thought) wasn't as good or well integrated as in Fallout. In the previous film learning more about Hunts 'weakness' for choosing people he cares about was very well done. It truly felt like we got to know what motivated him more on personal level and fit well with what we already had seen in the series. The flashbacks with the villain in this movie are a bit jarring since this is the seventh movie and we haven't had HINT of how Hunt ever became part of the IMF. It just kind of calls attention to itself too much. 

The music was pretty good, but had a very different tone from Fallout as well. Fallout had an almost Inception-ish vibe to parts with its integration of my synths which I thought was a huge, modern upgrade. It had the best renditions of the original theme, and made the 70s theme fit very well for a modern day movie. Go listen to ""The Exchange"" from Fallout's soundtrack. But all that was gone in this film... a movie with an A.I. character that seriously could have made use of those synth elements. This movie felt like a much more traditional soundtrack.

I didn't like the Ilsa sword vs dagger fight on the bridge. It felt fake and too choreographed. It had huge sweeping, kind of childish aerial camera moves that again contrasted the very real and gritty camera moves of Fallout. I compare that fight to the washroom fight in Fallout and just vomit thinking of the bridge scene. It felt like a completely different filmmaker and in a bad way. It was also exceedingly clear what was about to happen to Ilsa... who was basically underutilized in this movie and existed to die. Her last 10 or so minutes were mostly silent with no real impact on the scenes at the party. 

I really like Grace and thought she was a great new addition to the series. It was fun seeing a character be recruited into the IMF. 

I hope the next movie is good but I don't feel it is likely to exceed Fallout either. Same DOP and I imagine the music will probably be in the same style. If it is as good as this film then great a this was a pretty darn good movie. But overall I was really hoping Fallout would set the direction for the remainder of the series... but clearly it did not.",2023-07-27 02:23:21
I could go for a gritty MI like 1 or 3. Getting tired of these polished ones.,2023-07-27 03:42:52
"Let me start by saying, I am a fan of the franchise overall, not a fanboy, just a fan but...  
  
Is it a sign of the times and so many people have become too lazy to think for themselves or critically review a piece of cinema? I can‚Äôt even believe the near perfect reviews it‚Äôs getting on RT, are people blind, sheep or just incredibly stupid?  
  
That was the laziest writing I have seen in any of the series and if you were honest, you would really rate it alongside MI2 as being one of the worst of the series. I came so close to just walking out of the theatre after Ilsa's fate unfolded.  
Tropey is all I can say, it's like they just took a blueprint of Helena from Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and went... ""yeah that will do"".  
  
Warning spoilers ahead...  
So many times throughout the series the creators have made a specific point (very well) of creating complex characters, and in this case female characters.  They have been incredible. Ilsa was a brilliant, complex and complicated character who was capable of love, betrayal and everything and between and with this had a complex set of circumstances and motives that drove her, but at her core from the start you knew she was just like the team.. human, caring and would ALWAYS put the needs of the one or the many ahead of her own (A point driven home over and over again throughout the series and indeed in this movie both by Benji and Ethan) and it is this character trait, I believe, above all else that makes her and all of the characters so likeable and makes the viewer empathize with them and care about them.  
  
I almost feel like I should write the rest of this as lazily as this movie has been written so it can be understood by a 10-year-old and everyone else be damned.....So, I will... So, what do they do, they kill Ilsa and replace her with a tropey annoying twat. She steals from Ethan and leaves him for dead, he saves her life, she steals from Ethan and leaves him for dead, he saves her life and on and on and on. God so boring, character arc? what character arc?  
  
Ilsa was shown to be so bad ass in the previous films, and she randomly dies fighting Gabriel on a bridge getting stabbed, please, just shoot the fool and get it over with for god's sake. I could have killed that idiot, and I can barely kill a fly.  And again, she is replaced with a vacuous self-serving tropey ""criminal"" who brings nothing to the table.  
  
""We all faced a choice at the beginning"" says Luther, oh wow! great save writers, that really wraps it all up in a neat bow, congratulations! I really care about Grace as a character now!  It Reaks of ... Let's just discard this character and replace her with this character!"" and presto! job done.  
  
A few cool scenes for sure but half the dialogue and writing was cheesy and boring and just dragged on and on....... And ""the key"" the key this, the key that, bloody Norah who gives a damn about the key, if I hear about it one more time I think my head is going to explode.  
  
And for the love of God how the hell did no one, including Zola, notice that Grace as the White Widow had brown eyes when Alanna has blue eyes? There were a load of close-up shots of their faces and eyes leading up to the train scene. I mean these guys are supposed to be elite, best of the best criminals who are highly intelligent and don't miss a thing. Again, lazy and pathetic writing I mean my girlfriend noticed the eyes and she misses EVERYTHING in movie details.",2023-10-04 03:19:07
wow the writing was extremely corny and cheesy.,2023-10-11 04:55:16
"The action scenes didn't do it for me, particular the fight scenes.

Coming after the bathroom scene in *Fallout*, this doesn't scratch that itch.

Which is a shame, because we saw that MI *could* have fantastic fight choreography.

Also I hate how characters repeat dialogue twice. Character 1 summarizes the story in an already simple way. Character 2: ""So let me get this straight. You're saying..."".

This repetitive dialogue is such a pet peeve of mine in movies.",2023-10-12 10:18:57
"Got about 20mins into the film then left, utter dross how on earth did it get that 7.9 IMDB rating. The acting was poor and overall the storyline at that point made no real sense.",2023-10-15 04:55:16
"Not that great. They baby the audience by repeating the plot threads a lot. Unnecessary when the thread is: AI bad, need key + location.

It was silly to start it out by lecturing hunt over the mission briefing and more silly to get in his way. You can't have the state of things be impossibly dire and hinder people who have a track record of solving those problems.

Also, the source code doesn't do shit to stop anything. It's Ultron magic, and we needed vision magic to counter it.

It's bloated and feels long. 

The bad guy has incredible plot armor. Someone should just shoot him in the foot. 

Hayley atwel joined the team and got completely lucky she didn't die because hunt had no real plan to save her. Out of her depth by a mile - needs a year of training minimum. Also why couldn't hunt just fake her death like he has for others?

There is more but why bother. They can pay me to help edit the next one.",2023-07-12 16:26:25
"I think it sucked. Didn‚Äôt feel like a MI movie, right from the weirdly personal mission message to Ethan in the beginning. If it was that critical a message, it should‚Äôve been in person 

The major bike parachute stunt was shown to death in trailers but unlike when they did the same with Rogue Nation, the set piece was at the end of the movie instead of the beginning. Kinda reflective of this movies ambitions. Should never have been a two parter 

The tone was bizarre and didn‚Äôt feel like high stakes espionage was taking place like in the previous movies. A nuclear bomb in an airport should not be a whoop-de-doo situation, especially with how well Fallout did it. Previous movies were able to have humour while still treating serious situations with gravitas

I don‚Äôt know why or how the script became this mess but I suspect COVID and delays did this. That and the two part movie format. Its a weird thing to do when there‚Äôs no book as source material",2023-07-14 18:53:12
"Maybe I was just too hyped for this, but after Fallout, this feels like a significant step back. The idea of an AI that knows what Hunt and the team are going to do before they do and can calculate all the possible scenarios that may occur is solid; they just did a very poor job of showing that play out. There was also too much exposition around the Entity and what it can do, instead of showing its capabilities throughout the movie.

Shea Whigham's character felt pointless and added nothing to the overall storyline. There was a moment when he is first introduced, and they are tracking Ethan at the airport, that I thought it was going to go in a more Bourne Identity type of way, but they just ended up being useless characters that were always two steps behind.

I feel like Gabriel, as a villain, was just not menacing and too chill. They also shoehorned in a vague backstory that ties him to Ethan. Hunt was clearly alarmed to see him at the airport, but we are never really told why Gabriel is such a big threat.

Giving Hunt the choice of losing Ilsa compared to Grace, whom he met like a day earlier, felt off considering his years of history with Ilsa. Then we get like five seconds of Hunt being sad about it before he just moves right on. Hunt has shown that he puts his team above the mission in previous movies but here he pretty much contradicts that notion. It just kind of came and went. 

Also, there was no cold opening with Hunt.",2023-07-13 07:20:37
"So I did not enjoy the movie at all (about the opposite of the guy behind me when we were walking out of the theater who said it exceeded his expectations).

About 30-40 minutes into the film I started to recognize the unending exposition, which continued throughout the film -- never before have I had to sit through exposition 2 hours into a movie. That is when I started calling the movie Exposition: The Movie.

So this was when I got bored and started over analyzing the cinematography, which was hard to ignore given how this film seems to use Dutch Angles every other shot. But the angles aren't typical angles, instead they're 5 to 10¬∞? And then every other angle is seemingly downward or upward, which is fine but EVERY conversation is either someone exerting dominance or being dominated? That was when I changed my mind, this is Dutch Angel: The Movie.

Seems most people really enjoyed the film, I did not.",2023-07-15 02:34:48
"A little mystified by the universal critical acclaim. Was it bad? No. I had fun and it looked and sounded amazing in Dolby. But I don't think it comes close to the highs of the previous installments.  

It's ironic that a movie about bad AI felt like it was written by AI.

I thought the plot was awful. Like, I don't need MI to have a realistic plot or anything. but turning the villain into AI and then using a bland surrogate as the human face of the AI made the movie feel pretty lifeless to me. I thought the attempted retcon of Ethan and the rest of the IMF's backstory was ridiculous (why did they let him retire after MI3 then?) and forced. Without seeing the history between Ethan and Gabriel, the villain didn't work because there was simply no emotional baggage between the two of them, despite them trying to tell us it existed. Overall, you could really feel this movie explaining everything to us rather than showing us. The second scene was one of the worst scenes I've seen in a while ‚Äî just constant quick cutting to closeups while the characters dump exposition on us. All the exposition really took me out of the movie. I was not immersed in the movie until the final act. And I think that's a pretty damning indictment for a MI movie. 

I thought they missed a real opportunity to explore the impact of Ilsa's death on Ethan, by breezing past it after one short scene where Luther makes one comment about his relationship with her. It felt insignificant to the point where I didn't understand the point of killing one of the better characters in the franchise ‚Äî if it's not going to weigh on Ethan emotionally, then what's the point of killing her off?

The last 45 minutes were the most enjoyable, but even then, some absolutely ridiculous stuff happened -- Gabriel falling off the train into the bed of a pickup truck was such an eye roll. I didn't think the big stunt lived up to the hype because they spoiled it already in the trailer and the extended preview, and then they cut away from him attempting to land it.

I had fun. It wasn't terrible. I just expect more from these movies, because they've been so damn good since MI2. This is the first one I've seen since MI2 that I have no interest in rewatching. It's also the first time I've felt like they've become kinda stale, and I really think they need to switch it up moving forward. As much as it pains me to say it, I think the Luther and Benji stuff is getting stale. It's the same humor everytime. I wish they would be as willing to swap out the team as they are to swap out attractive brunette sidekicks. 

My takeaway is that this version of MI may have peaked with Fallout. I don't think they're going to find a way top Fallout unless they're willing to change.

Given how much I was anticipating this movie and how good the last few installments have been, I thought this was pretty disappointing. A solid 7/10.",2023-07-17 21:53:50
"My least favourite out of MI 4, 5 and 6.

The score felt reused from Fallout.  A lot of action but not the same suspense / gadgety scenes from the others which are gripping and I enjoy - climbing the tall building, using the projector screen to steal the files, accessing the water submerged computer server etc.

Overuse of CGI on the train falling sequences (plates falling etc stood out to me).  

Then the whole key thing‚Ä¶ she has the key, no, he has the key.  No wait, she thinks he has the key.  He thinks she has the key but actually he has both of them and doesn‚Äôt know.  I‚Äôm exaggerating but felt like we went round and round with the key idea and it became a bit contrived at the end.

It‚Äôs certainly not a bad movie and I enjoyed it - but I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlove‚Äù it.  I‚Äôll go see part two, but I felt this has been overhyped.  Ghost Protocol still my favourite.",2023-07-12 07:33:14
"Am I the only one who didn't love this movie? The opening was a slog, the exposition was repetitive and stilted, everything with Gabriel was tell not show, they rewrote canon, they invented a female character solely to retroactively fridge her, then they fridged Ilsa only for her to be instantly replaced by another love interest . . . seriously, this movie treats women like they are toys so Ethan can have a little pout when they get taken away.

The stunts were very cool, and there were some quite funny bits. There's a lot to like, but it's very tonally different from the more recent installments in a way that didn't resonate with me. If this was my first MI, I wouldn't seek out another. I'm glad other people enjoyed it though.",2023-07-13 03:44:43
"I was really bored by this movie aside from the final scene on the train - I felt as though I was watching the same conversations happen over, and over, and over again, as if the studio was concerned the audience wouldn‚Äôt quite grasp the danger of the AI, or the gravity of the key/Entity falling into the wrong hands.

Moreover, the revelation that the Entity is *afraid* of Ethan Hunt while making distorted animal noises made me burst out laughing, again playing into my theory that the studio was worried it wouldn‚Äôt come off as scary enough.

Gabriel as a villain was pretty weak, and didn‚Äôt feel earned - he‚Äôs not compelling enough to be the franchises‚Äô Big Bad.

Lastly, it suffers from the same thing any two parter does - the stakes aren‚Äôt all that high as you know at the least Ethan has to survive.",2023-07-12 18:25:29
"Painfully mediocre. The film was like 80% wonky dialogue. There‚Äôs more scenes of Cruise just running than genuine action scenes/set pieces. My mind is blown that it‚Äôs sitting at 96% on Rotten. Reading some of the reviews on there, it‚Äôs like critics watched a different movie from the one I did. Glad I watched it on a normal screen and didn‚Äôt buy into the hype and opt for IMAX.

Everything was too explanatory. The opening sequences for example, I would've preferred it if it was completely in Russian cause in English it sounded a little cringy and too simplified.

Also how many times do they say ""Entity"" and ""Key"" in this movie?? To the point I sometimes thought it was meant to be comical. Wasn't crazy for this AI and Macguffin idea at all.

"Compared to the preceding films, this one felt a little bit slapdash to me, like they reverse-engineered a plot to justify a cliff jump. But if you can feel them (Ethan, Grace, Cruise, McQuarrie) making it up as they go along, that‚Äôs sort of the spirit of the thing; in some ways, this is the scene in the first movie where Ethan does a magic trick with the drive, stretched to nearly three hours. It‚Äôs a lot more fun than that sounds, even if the middle act suddenly swings for serious with a little too much (unearned) force, showing the seams of an improvisational creative style that sometimes requires a sacrifice that more careful planning could‚Äôve avoided. Basically, Ilsa's death made sense within the movie's logic--I just don't understand the logic of making the movie's logic demand her death. 

Still, the movie got back on track by the time a train was flying off of one, and I don't think infinite AIs with infinite motorbikes could come up with all this wonderful daredevilry. If Cruise wants to eventually die on-screen for our pleasure, I say we let him keep trying.",2023-07-14 17:31:11

also if all the entity wants is no one to access the submarine for its source code why not just have gabriel destroy half of the key so no one could ever stop it? chuck it in the middle of the ocean, gg. no one can control destroy or stop it now.

"Two gripes about the film:

1) I still don't get how Ethan landed on that train let alone in the exact spot where he needed to be.

2) Paris saving Ethan and Grace felt like a cop out. There should've been a better way to end what would have been one of the best set pieces in the series.

Overall, it was fun. Not as good as Rogue Nation or Fallout. 8/10 for me.",2023-07-16 20:00:19
It was really good and definitely in the top half of the franchise but I really missed the darker vibe that Fallout had with much better cinematography.    There was nothing in this movie that matched the shots of Ethan peering out of the airplane ramp at the storm with the eerie music.    Fallout had a real vibe that set it apart from the others.    This one felt much more like GP or RN.   Anyone else get what I‚Äôm saying?,2023-07-16 21:17:45

"Ilsa > Grace

I am so annoyed.",2023-07-17 23:46:44
"I am in shambles after being so excited for this movie. If I had a nickel for each time:  
- there was a Dutch angle  
- a character finished another‚Äôs sentence  
- the key got pickpocketed  
- grace ran away from Ethan  
- another official in the us bureaucracy showed up on that train

I‚Äôd be able to buy all the rapidly depreciating cryptocurrency being moved around in that movie.

And the movie‚Äôs big stunt ending with Ethan accidentally crashing through the perfect part of the train at the exact moment Grace was about to get shot, and then his parachute opening and saving them again like he‚Äôs Mr. Bean, killed me. 

And while the train sequence was the one set piece that worked for me, it then ended with Grace and Ethan playing endless train car Frogger climb and only surviving because Harley Quinn, who‚Äôs said two words in the movie so far, has a nearly inexplicable change of heart.

I have so many other thoughts, including on the wild retconning of Ethan/IMF‚Äôs origin, the pacing (pretty sure Ethan doesn‚Äôt throw a punch until 90 minutes in), the tone break from Fallout, the AI-generated villain ‚ÄùGabriel‚Äù and the actual villain called ‚ÄúThe Entity‚Äù (like a 1990s idea of what a sentient computer villain would
be), but my brain and heart are numb. Finally, ‚Äúthe interested party is the party‚Äù has to go down infamy as an all-time ridiculous line.",2023-07-18 04:05:36

Its still good in my eyes (7ish out of 10), but I don't think the covid impacted production with multiple shutdowns has helped, in fact I'll blame it for the movies weaknesses. Apparently for instance Haley Atwell didn't even have lines for 6 months, there was more ad libbing etc.

I hope part 2 will be better, but that's also kinda being impacted now too by the strikes?

I see that the main complaint is too much exposition just between set pieces but they do this in almost every Mission movie, it was just more turgid and noticeable in this one. Maybe cause it's an AI villian and there's too much telling, not enough showing.",2023-07-19 07:30:44

Also the whole movie felt like it could‚Äôve been half as long but the latter half was dragged out almost like they only decided last minute they wanted a part two to make more money.

"Idk, it was pretty meh. Obviously some great action, but the plot and dialog was so goofy it felt like a Scary Movie style satire film. I really began to wonder if it was written by an AI. 

How does Paris get fatally stabbed in the chest, then save Ethan and Grace 10 minutes later moments before she dies? How does Ethan have enough speed from parachuting to smash through the steel walls of a train while also not being injured whatsoever? Ethan also clearly didn't have enough time to escape the Fiat before the subway train hit him. How the hell does Ilsa lose to a knife with a sword?! Is Ethan shifting the stick in the BMW while Grace isn't touching the clutch at all?

I know this type of stuff is common in action movies like this, but they stretch the suspension of disbelief much farther than most. And being MI, I have higher expectations of it.",2023-07-19 16:11:09

"Plot wise I thought this movie was nonsense. The core concept of the AI is cool and I like how it counters the typical mission impossible tech, but everything with Gabriel was weird. Who is he and how did he start working for this sentient AI? Why does he even believe the AI is sentient and not just some dude emailing him or whatever? He was not shown to be a great fighter but was able to kill Isla in a terribly choregraphed fight scene. Isla has a sword and Gabriel had a knife, why was she character trying to grabble with him instead of fighting from a distance. Baffling story telling choices. The action scenes were incredible though and I liked Ethan's chemistry with Grace. 

Did anyone else notice the hissing noise on the dialogue tracks during the train scene? I don't know if I've ever seen that in a movie of this budget. There was also a lot of noticeable ADR throughout the film.",2023-07-22 19:38:14

"Why did they kill off Ilsa so unceremoniously? Immediately replacing her with Grace also gave her no chance with fans of the franchise. 

I feel like Lane would have been a better villain than the guy they had here. Maybe 3 movies is overkill but he's easily the best villain they had going and his story isn't necessarily complete. They should have brought him back as the face of The Entity because the Gabriel part of this movie really dragged the movie down.

Also, while Cruise's ego may not be quite as rampant as some of the leads on the Fast & Furious series (Ethan gets beaten up and outmanoeuvred in ways that the Rock, Jason Statham or Vin Diesel would never allow themselves to be), I do roll my eyes whenever characters wax lyrical about how supernaturally capable Ethan Hunt or his villains are.",2023-07-28 08:08:16

EDIT: EVEN FURTHER ON THE ENTITY THING. THEY BARELY EVEN SHOW HOW NEFARIOUS/COOL IT COULD BE. THEY REALLY NEEDED IT TO DO MORE STUFF LIKE THE BENJI BOMB DEFUSE TO MAKE IT SOMEWHAT INTERESTING, OR MAYBE SHOW IT ATTACKING AMERICANS OR SOMETHING INSTEAD OF SOME RUSSIANS THAT I DONT CARE ABOUT, sheesh

The entity wasn‚Äôt an interesting ‚Äòthing‚Äô at all. Maybe if it messed with them more personally or even showed at all that it was ‚Äòscared‚Äô of Ethan instead of just them declaring it. The only cool thing that happens with that is benji defusing the bomb, but that‚Äôs literally the only thing that happens between the team and the entity on a ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô level. Gabriel is so lame and uninteresting. I have no idea how they expected me to care about something that‚Äôs literally never happened 6 movies in. There is SOOOOO much ridiculous exposition dumps that ultimately just WAY OVER explain ‚Äòwow hey, this thing is very powerful and could lead to extremely negative outcome for da whooooole world‚Äô as if we haven‚Äôt just had 6 fucking movies all with the same exact concept. Every new character outside of maybe the two cop guys chasing Ethan the whole movie were so boring. Even the main one (Hayley atwell) her motivations in this movie are just dumb. She‚Äôs obviously involved in something now that‚Äôs WAY bigger than whatever record she‚Äôs trying to erase, ugh everything about this movie was just so beyond disappointing.

  I‚Äôm not even joking for the standard of the series overall this might be my least favorite one, even mission impossible 2 I can enjoy more than this in the ‚Äòso bad it‚Äôs good‚Äô sense because of just how ridiculous and silly it is compared to this just being boring

Loved how they utilised The Entity, pitting the technologically advanced IMF against their own hardware was a nice touch to ramp up the techno-thrills.

Atwell was a great addition to the cast primarily because Grace calling out the insanity of Ethan‚Äôs life was a much needed outsider perspective. Also because Atwell in a suit was giving me gay panic and I‚Äôm a straight dude.

Felt Gabriel was a bit undercooked but I‚Äôm willing to give him a chance if they expand on his history with Ethan in Part 2.

- Ilsa‚Äôs very quiet and generally acting kind of strange from when they pick Ethan up in Rome to her death. She knows more about The Entity than the rest of the team, and the reason she gives is literally just ‚ÄúI know someone.‚Äù

- There‚Äôs an insert shot of a security camera recording Ethan and Ilsa as they enter the party. There‚Äôs never any follow-up as to why that shot is there, but later, when Luther talks about how he needs to decrypt the hard drive with all of the data from the party, we‚Äôre left wondering what ‚Äúdata‚Äù might be there and why it might matter. The only other two instances where camera recordings matter in this movie are when Ethan and Grace are detected in Rome, and then when they see Gabriel getting erased on the footage in Abu Dhabi.

- During the party itself, several knowing looks are exchanged between Gabriel and Ilsa, while Ethan remains confused. Why?

- Luther, Gabriel, and The Entity all know that Ethan will fail if he kills Gabriel in revenge, and thereby destroying any hope of knowing what the key will unlock. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to think that The Entity might be trying to make this happen.

- Hayley Atwell explicitly said her character isn‚Äôt a love interest and isn‚Äôt meant to interfere with the relationship between Ethan and Ilsa.

- Chris McQuarrie is a smart screenwriter and everything else that‚Äôs ever been penned in these movies is done with lots of intent. And Rebecca Ferguson is still listed as a cast member for MI8 according to IMDb.

My theory is that Ilsa isn‚Äôt dead and that the Ilsa we see beyond the intro is someone else, most likely working for The Entity and trying to derail Ethan, in a mask. The team is going to find this out when Luther shows them the footage from the party and we see that fake Ilsa is also being erased in real-time.",2023-07-12 13:24:11
This movie is hot garbage!,2023-07-16 03:08:25
"Probably the worst opening scene in the franchise.

Throughout the whole movie, there is just too much repetitive dialogue, you really don't need to spend 10 minutes on some boring suits explaining the dangers of AI. Between all this AI talk and clich√©d scenes like a police officer reminding a person under arrest about all of their past crimes, I was really bored while waiting for the action scenes to start. And even the action didn't feel that exciting, too much of been there, done that. Okay, the train scene was good, but all of the bike jump was basically spoiled by the trailers. The chase in Rome was really annoying, I was waiting for Hunt to showcase his driving skills, but they kept him at disadvantage by chaining him to Grace for far too long. 

The decision to kill Ilsa was horrible. All of that development from the previous two movies went into nothing. They should have kept her as one of the main characters and just written Grace out of the movie. Grace was a character that we've seen a million times, someone greedy and selfish who has a change of heart. Just look at the last Indiana Jones for an example of that. The villain was really contrived, felt like lazy writing. Ethan Hunt is just not a type of character who needs these villains from his distant past.

Such a huge disappointment, especially after how great MIs 4-6 and Maverick were. For me, it was surely the worst MI movie.",2023-07-12 23:06:15
"I left the theater super angry. What were the writers thinking?

I was so excited for this movie. 

Everything was amazing until they killed off Ilsa. 

What the fuck were they thinking? 

They killed her off like she was a minor character and immediately gave Ethan a new sidekick in Grace.

If Rebecca Ferguson was busy with other projects they could‚Äôve just written her out of the movie like they did with Jeremy Renner.

I literally left the theater furious. To kill the ONLY female lead to make it past 1 movie is insane.

If Benji or Luther had been killed off their deaths would‚Äôve been way more dramatic and actually impacted the story. Here they just killed her off and just forgot about everything Rebecca Ferguson brought to the table in Rogue Nation. 

I don‚Äôt know whose decision it was but it was a shit decision",2023-07-13 00:51:00
"Hayley Atwell‚Äôs character was terribly written. Full stop. It has zero to do with her acting, but fridging a loved character for someone so awfully one-dimensional was a slap in the face.",2023-07-17 04:04:12
"Hated it. Hard to choose just 6 but here‚Äôs the top 6 stupidest parts:  

1. Gabriel repeatedly blocking a sword with a small knife‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not how it works Hollywood   

2. Needed to fake a nuke to find out that someone wants to live and cares about his friends.  

3.  Jumping off the 80mph in a dump truck because of a timer that can‚Äôt possibly know exactly where you are standing on the train.   

4. Using knifes to climb up the train like it‚Äôs made of styrofoam   

5. Why does the AI only interfere with MIF communication the one time? Also if it‚Äôs in all the electronics why is their one physical key that can stop it?   

6. Tiny Asian girl who was stabbed has super human strength to pull up 2 people at once",2023-07-16 04:03:09

"I hated this movie, i considered walking out.

1. AI doesn‚Äôt need visual representation, and if it did it would t be the iTunes visualiser.

2. Dont kill off female love interests just to introduce a fresh one.

3. Is grace a master criminal or a helpless moron? The movie seemed to change its mind. Shes being picked up by state actors to complete multimillion dollar jobs but she cant drive a fucking car? She looks like shes never been in a fight countless times in the movie but is also a badass knife wielding ninja? Just make her badass, she doesnt need to be helpless just to be saved for the sake of the love interest. 

4. Lazy writing using the characters dumb outloud questions as opportunities to explain the plot to the audience.

Truly, very bad.",2023-07-24 02:09:00
"I watched the ""fan"" screening last night (free mini-poster and an IMF pin) and I've already forgotten half of what it's about.

Here's my honest review of the film: I enjoyed it, but it's just like all the others.

Let's face it, all these movies feel interchangeable with one another. The only thing that changes are the set pieces and the one dangerous stunt that Cruise does himself. Only difference here is that this film is too damn long and it doesn't have a *fucking ending*. We have no idea what that double key is going to unlock. And I'm not in any hurry to find out.

This is not a knock on Tom Cruise or the Mission Impossible films. They are fun, light entertainment. But they are also hollow, shallow and forgettable. In the nearly three-hour runtime, there were only 3 or 4 action sequences that really stood out to me: the whole airport chase/double cross, the ~~tuk-tuk~~ Fiat 500 chase (which had the biggest laugh when it went down the stairs and they had swapped seats), and of course the huge motorcycle jump leading into the extended ~~1944~~ train sequence. Those were all astounding and incredible set pieces. If you ask me what the rest of the movie was about, I would say it's about long boring exposition speeches, keys and the fact that everyone keeps pickpocketing everyone else (and apparently, no one ever notices).

I loved all the women here; Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Pom Klementieff were all awesome and kicked ass. Ethan Hunt himself continues to be a very boring, infallible character to me. Compared to James Bond or John Wick, he's a generic Mary Sue (Gary Stu?) perfect action hero. Juxtapose this with someone like Indiana Jones, who feels a lot more imperfect, vulnerable, fully fleshed out and well-rounded as a character.

I found M:I very entertaining and engaging while I was watching it. But it just doesn't stay with me when it's over. This is what I mean by ephemeral entertainment. It's fun in the moment, but I don't really care about any of the characters. It's just not substantial to me the way something like Indy is.

And speaking of which, after my fan screening ended, I went for a double dip of Dial of Destiny, just because I felt like I needed a more satisfying movie with an actual ending.",2023-07-12 02:45:08
"That car chase and train sequence are all time insane action sequences, but the movie felt kinda...meh? Opening wasn't engaging and the villain felt too cheesy. Grace is a cool character but Ilsa was literally put into the movie to do nothing but wait around and die (and in mediocre fashion). Character motivations and whose side they were on weren't entirely clear either. Heard multiple times walking out the theater ""kinda disappointed"" and that people were confused about the plot the whole movie, which is exactly how I feel. Considering all the money, time, and effort put into this, especially being the first movie back during Covid, it's just wild to me this is the end product, I expected something much more grand in scope in terms of story. I really did like how the AI was a challenge for Ethan's tech team though, that really added an element of suspense.

There's a lot of elements that reminded me of the first one, which I appreciated, but considering Fallout is straight up one of the best action movies I've ever seen, they really should have kept leaning in that direction. Also, unless the movie is based on a specific arc of an IP, there's no reason a movie should be a ""part one"" or ""part two"" -- that's simply called a sequel follow up to the next one. On top of that, if you ARE gonna do that, they should at the very least be filmed at the same time -- which I thought this was, but apparently they've been filming the new one recently -- which again blew my mind because to me it seems they've been filming this movie for like 3 years straight.  THIS MOVIE? C'mon, there was way crazier stuff overall in Fallout.

Not super interested in the submarine stuff they're going to have to do in the next one, so that cliffhanger wasn't all that exciting.

"Am I stupid or did that entire venice scene make no fucking sense? I really liked the last 3 MI movies and was hyped af for this but it just didnt land for me. Im too stupid to pinpoint exactly what made this movie bad but it felt like nothing happened even though it was really long. It was like a 3 hour chase scene, there werent really any fun missions, not really any twists. The fight choreography wasnt good, especially the sword fight, it felt like that under the bridge rave dancing. The first 20 mins were great though. It was also like 300 decibels in my theatre, bone rattling. Overall I wish I didnt go. Also Rebecca Ferguson > Haley Atwell",2023-07-16 01:15:18
"This is the most exciting action franchise currently. While Fallout is still my favorite, I do like how each entry in the MI franchise finds ways to stay fresh & exciting. It was also really interesting to see Christopher McQuarrie have Ethan Hunt go against artificial intelligence & have audiences ponder what happens when AI develops a mind of its own. The movie was outstanding & I can‚Äôt wait to see where Part Two will takes us.",2023-07-12 02:17:49
"While not bad, it definitely falls a bit flat for being part 1 of 2. Instead of having a world saving adventure, it's more so setting up the pieces for the next movie. Not as much action as I'd have hope with most of the action feeling a bit like a rehash of previous films. Didn't dislike it at all, but definitely think it's the weakest of MacQuarrie's 3 MI films so far. Hopefully the setup in Part 1 has great payoff in Part 2 next year.",2023-07-12 02:50:16

Would have gotten a good laugh.",2023-07-12 15:50:20
"I‚Äôm going to be completely honest: I‚Äôm kind of disappointed. The movie wasn‚Äôt bad, it just had a lot of issues that made it feel super off. Too many characters, wack pacing, bloated exposition, some goofy dialogue, misused characters and topping it off with a serious lack of character development. 

Feels like how a finale would feel, but we only got the slow ramp up to the part 2 climax with some crazy set pieces sprinkled in. Definitely felt like the stakes weren‚Äôt realized well enough to give it that oomph of adrenaline. I think that could have been realized better if they had Ethan lean into that theme of Destiny, or rejecting it while others obeyed it. That would have made for compelling character work, while also making The Entity feel like a present‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ entity. Because right now it just feels like a boogeyman who conjured a bunch of new characters into existence to push the plot with no explanation into who they are, or why they are doing what they do.",2023-07-17 05:19:24

Wasn't that great.""

I greatly dislike the presumably real death of Ilsa after an early fake out. I also dislike the introduction of a new character that Ethan cares about so late into the series. And most of all I dislike the catch all AI sentient villain. Ethan needs a real person as a villain, not an algorithm or a collective. I hope the second part makes for a satisfying ending.

"Anybody else feel like they really built up the dirt bike off the mountain stunt too much? Like they really telegraphed it and built it up with Benji leading him but not telling him the truth of what the path lead to, and then Ethan stopping and telling Benji how impossible the impossible thing was? It felt like they were really building that up to where the audience was supposed to be like, ""oh my god, he's going to drive off the cliff and parachute?!?!"" It felt built up like ""this is the craziest stunt ever!"" But its...it's not even close to the craziest thing he's ever done? Like this guy hung off a flying jet without even pausing to think about it.

I don't think he should have stopped at the cliff. It should have been, Benji tells him while he's driving that he has to go over the cliff. He argues while he's driving, something like, ""I can't even see the train!"" And Benji will say, ""it's there! You have to trust me! There's no time!"" And then he sees the ramp cliff off to the right and veers to it and goes off the edge blind. That would have felt like less build up and more exciting.

But I don't mean to devalue that incredible practical stunt in any way. I appreciate it all, Mr. Cruise.",2023-07-12 18:53:27

Thought Grace might be Gabriel's lover and was infiltrating his team like Claire did. The fist fight on top of the speeding train. etc. etc. 

I thought Ethan would suddenly recognize the parallels and realize that the AI was intelligent enough to manipulate people into elaborate scenarios but can't create anything original. He'd know Gabriel was escaping the train via helicopter and would use that to stop him. 

But I was overthinking everything and they were just random callbacks. Oh well.

"I noticed Joe Cornish's name in the Special Thanks credits. I wonder if this is his reward for (very gradually) telling the Tom Cruise Anecdote on Adam Buxton's podcast?

I liked the film a lot, but my biggest disappointment is that after Fallout, this is the second M:I film in a row that doesn't feature the team planning how to get into a place with absurdly specific security measures. Okay, we have a *bit* of that when we see the initial version of the Orient Express plan, but it's not exactly the noise detectors at the CIA vault, or the closing air vents in the M:I-2 laboratory, or the gait recognition sensors in Rogue Nation, is it? :(

Also, I had hoped that the Fallout's acknowledgement that Hunt and his team *always* go rogue (""How many times has Hunt's government betrayed him, disavowed him, cast him aside?"") would lead to this being the first film since M:I-2 that focuses on a sanctioned mission throughout. Sadly not, although we do get a nice joke about how this *always* seems to happen.

(Also, the description of Ethan Hunt given here is even more delightful than the glorious ""living manifestation of destiny"" line in Rogue Nation.)

**The Entity**

I admit wasn't fully on board with the idea of making an AI the big antagonist. I know this is a series that's had things like implanted brain bombs and electromagnetic levitation vests, but even though machine learning and predictive algorithms have been on all our minds recently, somehow this feels like a step too far out of spy fiction and into science fiction.

To be fair, the movie primarily treats the Entity as a tool like the Rabbit's Foot or the Chimaera virus - the weapon over which various factions are fighting to control - rather than something that plans to go all HAL/Skynet/Ultron. But there is still a lot of stuff about the Entity seeming to have its own motivations for doing things.

For that reason, I kept expecting the film to reveal that everything that appeared to be the Entity acting on its own would actually turn out to be a human villain controlling it (say, Solomon Lane, somehow). Maybe Part Two will reveal that Gabriel's alliance with it was just based around him reading motivations into its actions and seeing what he wanted to see, like tea leaves or tarot cards? (There's a lot of religious imagery at play, with Gabriel as the emissary of this god...)

**Bond film references**

Previously, most similarities between the M:I series and Bond films could be dismissed as due to the fact they share the action-spy genre. But here, the allusions to Bond films felt intentional: a submarine opening (The Spy Who Loved Me), the Orient Express (From Russia With Love), a car chase in a tiny car (For Your Eyes Only).

Plus, Mark Gatiss showing up in the US security briefing was almost as surprising as Hugh Dennis turning up randomly in No Time To Die!

**M:I series references**

Lots of little callbacks to previous M:I films, particularly the first one:

- The Gabriel flashbacks were shot in a way very reminiscent of Jon Voight/Jean Reno killing the team in Prague in the first film.
- Sleight of hand with the McGuffin!
- Kittridge on a train near to Max or a member of her family, while something happens veeerrryyy slooowwwly via a mobile phone. (NOC list transmission/cryptocurrency decryption.)
- Playing with Russian subtitles: Ghost Protocol had the bit after the Kremlin explosion where the subtitles start off untranslated to represent Ethan's grogginess; here, the submarine opening had an overlapping transition to English. (Also vaguely Hunt for Red October-esque?)
- Rogue Nation's car chase had a bit where Ethan and Benji bump into a surprised Luthor and Brandt and they acknowledge each other before continuing the chase; in this, a similar moment happens with Ethan and the two agents tracking him.

But there were other bits that felt inconsistent with previous films. Like: is this really the first time that a new Director of National Intelligence would have heard of the IMF? In previous films loads of people seemed to know about them, so I would've thought that anyone on their way toward that job would learn about them earlier! And I get the idea that IMF field agents might be recruited from shadowy pasts, but does that really apply to Benji, who we first met as a computer tech guy behind a desk?",2023-07-13 19:55:26

I preferred the tone of Fallout more and I do wonder if they intended for Fallout to be the actual closing film of the franchise. Felt like it had more finality to it. DRP1 was definitely more winking and even slapstick -- at one point they are literally threatened by a piano dangling overhead like it was a Buster Keaton movie. Not complaining, but it was definitely a shift.

I do wish they had gotten a more ""name"" actor for Gabriel. As a villain he was basically a total blank.",2023-07-14 03:57:02

"Come to think about it, Christopher McQuarrie keeps reusing the same villain for every movie. In Fallout it was literally the same character, but for this, the entity is essentially the same concept: someone who can think of every single outcome and possibility, so Ethan has to avoid doing the obvious to win. 

We're starting to see the drawbacks of having the same director make multiple movies in this franchise. This is coming from someone who likes the movie btw but it's frustrating to see McQuarrie doubling down on the weaker aspects of his films.",2023-07-14 12:20:01
"It‚Äôs a great time and I was shocked at how fast it breezed by, but it felt less satisfying than the past couple entries.

My only real gripes are Gabriel being way *too* cartoony of a villain (my wife laughed every time he came on screen) and Ilsa maybe dying to him. I‚Äôm 95% sure it‚Äôs another fakeout to throw the Entity (a very cool MI threat btw) off their plans, but as we don‚Äôt currently have part two, it feels like a very awkward moment. 

Also every time Hayley Atwell was on screen my brain short-circuited. In a movie full of very hot people she had me constantly thinking she‚Äôs the prettiest person I‚Äôve ever seen. Grace is a fantastic addition to the cast.",2023-07-14 17:57:21

- Woman getting out of handcuffs unexpectedly, then handcuffing the man.

- Old timey train dining car.

- The AI literally guides people's actions in real time through ear pieces and through the voices of other people. 

- It arranges elaborate ambushes and setups to trip up the main character. 

- The main character is going to have to go down into the ocean to find the thing that will enable them to destroy the AI they hate.


Just another case of parallel creativity. No way either could have copied the other. Probably a bit of an 'Oh fuck' moment for Tom and the gang when they were doing post on this film. Obviously two very different tones and each one has enough to set it apart from the other.",2023-07-15 08:22:00
"So, Ilsa dies, and then Ethan has a three second moment on a roof. Then Luther explains how Gabriel did that to make Ethan want to kill him. Sure. But this conflict is resolved by the CIA idiots showing up suddenly on top of the train just in time to stop him?",2023-07-15 22:32:29
Did anyone else sense that the submarine is already looted by a third party who then split the keys up? I was confused at how the keys were initially divided up if the corpses were all recovered at the same time.,2023-07-16 01:21:18
"After second viewing, I'm even more convinced that Ilsa is not actually dead. When they get to Venice, she spends an unspecified amount of time alone with Ethan (after their lovely moment on the rooftop to the boat ride to the party).   
Then when they are being confronted by Gabriel and the White Widow, when Gabriel says either Grace or Ilsa will die tonight, Ilsa gives a knowing smile towards Ethan. I think this moment specifies that they have foreseen this exchange and she knows exactly what to do.  
I believe this is a plan that spans over two films and not everything shown in this part is a final one and can have overarching trajectory in the next part.",2023-07-16 03:33:28

"really solid movie...but i simply don't understand how NOBODY could know about the submarine? they said that the bodies with the keys floated to the surface and when the bodies were found the keys were missing. did the people who found the bodies/keys attached to the clearly naval commanders NOT guess that they had come from either a ship or submarine? they at the very least had to suspect that they came from nearby? and Cary Elwes character said only he knew but OBVIOUSLY he did not go diving down there alone, nor would he be the one manually doing the data acquisition he would have a team since he is a senior person in that organization. did he kill everyone else? probably not. not to mention that clearly SOMEONE in the Russian government would have been aware of the technology and the submarine in the first place

very fun, but that one detail kind of drives the whole movie of 'can't kill gabriel because he's the only one who knows the key detail' and yet it doesn't make sense that he would be the only one to know

LASTLY i immediately noticed that Grace in the mask had a different eye color than the blond bad girl (Grace's are brown, White Widow's are blue). like right away. how does her number 2 in command not notice this? more importantly, they obviously used Kirby as the actress for both roles because masks like that are not real which means that they CHOSE to change her eye color for each character. did they think the audience is too stupid to realize which one is Grace and which isnt and hence change the eye color so we could tell? seemed really weird to me from a creative choice",2023-07-16 22:00:14

"Just came back from the cinema, and wanted to lay out my thoughts:

The good: 

* action sequences are still unmatched, so much fun to watch

* Grace's character stole the show for me, expertly portrayed by Hayley Atwell. They did an excellent job of writing a highly competent yet out of its depth character

* I like how much this film lets so many characters have their moment to shine

* The entire train sequence start to finish was epic, I was fully gripped

* Amazing pacing for a 3 hour movie, I was never bored.

* Vanessa Kirby, so good. Especially when she had to act a bit disjointed whilst Grace's character had her mask


The Bad 

* A bit weird how much of an afterthought Ilsa Faust seemed like in this installment. After the kickass scenes in the desert I thought she'd have more of an impact. Very clear passing of the torch but done a bit weird

* Also onto the same area, Ilsa's death was anti-climatic. Unlike what you'd expect of such a central character

* Some of the last minute escapes in the first part of the film were a touch too ridiculous even for a Mission Impossible film, they felt a bit gimmicky


Overall, I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend anyone to watch it. It's true what others say that it's not as good as Fallout, but still a very strong proper action film the likes of which are very rare these days",2023-07-17 21:52:45

"One thing I've found hilarious are there are several comments saying the filmmakers ""messed up"" by forgetting that Hayley Atwell and Vanessa Kirby have different color eyes.

The filmmakers didn't mess up.  They would have had to deliberately change Kirby's eye color  to match Atwell's.  The fact that you're thinking it's actually Atwell in that moment and that they forgot to change \*her\* eye color to blue only emphasizes how convincing and well-done that scene was.  If your criticism is that the IMF team forgot to change her eyes, their machine broke.

(Also, Zola only saw her for a second and was more focused on her clothing change, before she told him to leave the room, and Kittredge hadn't seen her since she was a little girl.  It wasn't like anyone was staring her straight in the face.)",2023-07-18 14:28:12

Except for the ending train scenes, the stunts and set pieces are great but still felt..kinda boring and cliche. Like, another action movie fight scene on top of a train? The car chase in Italy went on way too long. The AI entity villain who knows everything is not really intimidating (and kept reminding me of Gods Eye from Fast and Furious, which made it silly to me), and then Gabriel just seemed like a regular well dressed dude and not someone the characters should fear. And the CIA/other agents who literally only show up to move the characters along  and just lazily pop up wherever it‚Äôs convenient. 

And maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I can‚Äôt stand pick pockets in movies. It just seems like silly magic when it just teleports between characters.

"* Train scene > cliff jump
* The dialogues between people in the agency were sooooo heavy, with stiff delivery and too much of theatricality. 
* Smashing a small woman's head on the wall of bricks will take her out only for 5 seconds apparently. Need to do it two times more. Also - holding a metal pipe doubles the amount to danger you pose to the main character? Doesn't matter that in a narrow alley you don't even have space to properly swing it.
* Why does she need to put in her IBAN if they are transferring crypto to her. Did they need to ""decrypt the blockchain"" for that? All around this plot device looked like it was made by a boomer not understanding crypto.
* Going a bit too hard on slight of hand tricks. People pickpocketing and putpocketing each other like crazy. Started to feel like any minute I will see that cringe CGI scene from Now you see me 2.
* Did Ving Rhames just checked out himself from the series? ""I have to go to a very desolate place to work on eliminating entity from the hard drive"". Come on.

"I really wanted to like this movie. But I truly think I‚Äôm just bored of the blockbuster. Even the stunts (admittedly really cool) I just didn‚Äôt find all that interesting. I honestly wished it leaned into the corniness more. Give me more James Bond type stuff. More completely specialized gadgets. Let the actors ham it up. 

My favorite part was definitely the beginning sequence with the masks. Tom Cruise swapping faces twice in a row was pretty comedic and clever. 

The submarine sequence at the beginning was also cool as hell. I was locked in up until the torpedo hit their own sub. The scare of the ‚Äúother‚Äù sub was incredibly effective

"Can someone explain to me Grace‚Äôs motivation in Venice between the party scene and the fights on the bridge?


I feel like her motives are fairly clear before that point, and clear after that point, but in between I was very confused.


So she is a thief, she steals something valuable and will hold onto it until she gets paid, that makes sense. Then at the party the White Widow reveals she hired her to steal the half-key. Shouldn‚Äôt she try to get paid there and then?

Then at the VIP lounge a lot gets explained, it‚Äôs a bit of an info overload but the outcome at the end is the Widow became even more desperate to get her hands on the completed key. Well, then this should be the moment for Grace to get paid to deliver the half-key.


But no, she helps Ethan get the key away from the Wdiow‚Äôs men. At this point I thought she saw the importance of the key and knows Ethan having it is what‚Äôs best for ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù as it were.


But no, she again deliberately gets away from Ethan with the key. So motivation-wise, the only thing that makes sense would be she wants to sell it to someone else, probably Gabriel who also needs it.


But no, as soon as she saw Gabriel on the bridge, the knives come out and she tried to shank him.


So what the hell is she even trying to accomplish in this part of the story?",2023-08-21 18:47:48
"Ok. Late to the film but just watched it. Have to say... disappointed. It wasn't terrible... but it was incredibly mediocre... especially after fallout.

The stunts were pretty average. Most of the motorbike scene jumping off the cliff looked mostly CGI, which is weird because I've seen the videos and it wasn't. I get they had to cgi in the floor because there was ramps, but why did it all look green screen. The fight scene in that narrow alleyway was shot badly. The chase scene was good but again, not as good as the chase scene in fallout.

The pickpocket character was just annoying. Considering her line of work, I expected a better skillset from her but she was quite bad at almost everything else. Ethan chasing her became really tiresome and I was sick of it by the third time.

Ilsa was such an interesting character, I'm quite unhappy that she was killed. She was probably one of the better additions to the cast since MI3. Gabriel is such a zzzzz villain.

Now my main gripe. This AI. Other movies have gone this route and did it a lot better. Eagle eye being one of them. If these AIs are capable of doing terrible things, then the AI in this movie is pretty tame. It also doesn't come across as very smart. However, the most annoying thing is Ethan and co know what this AI is capable of, but continue to use tech and communication methods that can easily be tapped by this AI. The last thing I'd be doing is using tech knowing that this machine is capable of listening in or sabotaging missions.",2023-09-18 18:22:49

"It was boring, and it shouldn't be a two parts movie. Most Mission Impossible movies, you know they're gonna win, the fun part is seeing what kind of crazy shit the team is gonna have to pull to reach their objective. Here it's kinda telegraphed, because it's so long (almost 3 hours) while only being a part one. Many scenes are artificially extended by having big pauses in the dialogue or the action to put an emphasis on how serious the situation is. Sure, there are some funny moments, but they're rare in a very long movie, and they feel really artificial. I'm saying all that while i really liked the previous movies, and i was hoping it would be close in quality.


The plot is kinda Terminator : replace ""The Entity"" by Skynet and Gabriel by a Terminator, and you've got the plot of most Terminator movies, time travel aside. And surfing on the AI/virus trend seems kinda cheap. The first action sequence in the desert feels way too much like watching a guy play a videogame, and while i love videogames, i don't think that look suits Mission Impossible.

It's too clean : the bad guy looks like a model walking into a photoshoot, most scenes have people with impeccable makeup/clothes, while doing impressively athletic sequences. There's even a point where Grace is ducking in a coal container, IN A TUNNEL, with the fumes and everything, and next scene she has no coal residue anywhere on her... It's nothing major but it takes you away from the movie, everything looks too polished and artificial.

The movie being so long, and artificially so, everything is kinda predictable, starting with Atwell's role tailor made to replace Ferguson's Faust. It's a two parter so you know they have to get the key somehow. Paris (what kind of a stupid name that is...) not dying and revealing the Sebastopol is telegraphed and way too convenient.

After two very good movies, it felt like a lazy and calibrated one. The direction choices are also questionnable, especially during the car chase : pointing the camera at the driver most of the time didn't really make it impressive or interesting. The train stunts at the end are either unbelievable (the parachute landing at the right moment is ridiculous, the whole fight in a tunnel while hanging from the roof is way too silly also) or too long (jumping 3 or 4 wagons, with grease oil and everything).

I was hoping for a repeat of the previous ones in terms of performances and action, but i was really disapointed. The movie is weak and could have been so much stronger if it was one big 3 hours movie but with the whole story inside, discarding the fluff.",2023-07-14 22:08:12

"Sweet Jesus, Tom does it again, as expected I guess at this point. The film was great, maybe not quite on the level of fallout but it's up there. The plot runs at a breakneck pace, it's wall to wall awesome but the action isn't nauseating. The characters are all given lots to do and I'm glad I rewatched MI Fallout (in 3D unlike this one unfortunately...) last night because of the connection to the previous film via the broker character played by Vanessa Kirby.

I noticed more moments of subtle comedy in this one, I feel like the writers had fun with it - it's got all the classic lines but there are some fun mix-ups and visual gags for those who pay extra attention.

Also, it has the best surround sound I've heard in the theater since avatar 2. It can go very loud at times but the mix is super dynamic, there were moments that were so quiet you could hear a pin drop in the theater. There's a sequence in a sandstorm that sounds so effective if my eyes were closed it'd be practically indistinguishable haha. And goes without saying that the soundtrack was on point.

"Hey guys, for me it seems like I've seen a whole different movie than you, obviously, M:I Dead Reckoning Part 1 is rated highly. And while I understand that as a standalone action movie it is very well executed and solid, it is imho very disappoint as a part of the Mission: Impossible franchise. I just want to share my 2 cents on it.

For me, it was a 5/10 at most. And I live and breathe the M:I franchise over everything else, like Star Wars, LOTR, Potter, whatever. I also love and admire Tom Cruise for his incredible work. I am a male in my thirties and have seen every M:I movie on the big screen as it came out, except for the first one in the nineties.

But for me, this new installment in the franchise just falls flat. Let me explain why.

First off, it is far too comical. There were always small jokes or light moments during the franchise, but the whole beginning part of this movie felt more like a Marvel Love and Thunder dumbness. The car chasing scene in the first half was incredibly hard to watch, complete opposite from the one in Fallout in Paris for example. How many times will you recycle the ""woman can't drive"" joke. The movie theater laughing for 10 minutes straight is not what I expect when going to a MI-film, at all. This already has wrecked me completely to the point I almost started crying to what they had done to this part of my favorite franchise.

Not ""dark"" enough, goes along with my first point. There is no feel of real danger or menace, like in M:I 3 or Fallout for example. Ethan was always ahead of the situation or everything turned out great after every scene. The scene from Fallout with the heist on Solomon Lane's truck, to catch him right in front of the Police eyes? Planned and done perfectly.

The only ""dark"" moment was when Gabriel kills Ilsa, but again, that happened just for the plots sake, to tear off some emotion from the audience. Of course it was Ilsa to die, we wouldn't care at all if it would have been Grace instead.

This theme gets even worse with the main villain. Gabriel was a wet towel, compared to Owen Davian or Solomon Lane. Esai Morales played well, don't get me wrong, just the character itself was very shallow. Those guys were a real threat for Ethan and the IMF as a whole. In contrast to that, Ethan plays with Gabriel the whole movie and defeats him twice in Part 1 already, one by having the opportunity to kill him easily if not for Gabriel's plot armor, the other by stealing the key in the end. Where is the tension going into part 2 if the main villain is no threat and just a joke to be played with?

The whole AI thing is also very hard to grasp. I get it why they've chosen it, to give the story a 70s vibe with the analog technique to be used, as a nod to the original M:I series. But AI going rogue and people trying to abuse it for power feels so sucked dry and seen millions of times already.

There is no real Mission: Impossible moment. That one is the biggest one for me I suppose. Like no moment in the movie lets you sit on the edge of your seat watching Ethan do a crazy stunt or activity for minutes. No tension. Every movie had that kind of moment:M:I server room sceneMI:2 Entry into Biocyte tower, exchange of Chimera and BellerophonMI:3 Ethan interrogation with Davian and death after electrocution, resurrectionMI:4 Burj Kalifa climbMI:5 Underwater Server RoomMI:6 Halo jump, Solomon RescueMI:7 tried this with the bike jump, but it was already dead on arrival, seen it so often on Instagram, trailer, general movie PR. Also, it was over like in seconds and while I can imagine how hard this stunt was to pull of, just watching it felt ""meh, whatever.""

You didn't even see him flying towards the train and aiming at it, that would have provided some tension at least. Also, the CGI of the rocks, which meant to hide the ramp was done incredibly poorly.

Also, the opening of the movie with the submarine stuff felt more like a James Bond, instead of M:I. In every film of the franchise the opening would include Ethan and his team doing things to kick off the plot. The screen time of Luther and Benji felt too short, I especially love Luther's character.

Easter eggs or recalls, plot repeats:

So many, especially to M:I 2:

* Gabriel shouts ""Ethan"" at the end, like Sean shouts ""Hunt"" when Sean finds out he replaced his right hand Billy and got him killed.
* The ""parachute is only for one"" thing is straight up repeated form the same plot line in the end of M:I 2 Biocyte tower, where he leaves Nyah with Sean and escapes by himself with his parachute.
* Whole train sequence felt like already seen, because we actually did see it exactly like that in M:I
* mention of a collier of Bulgary if I recall correctly, like the one Nyah tries to steal in Seville in M:I 2
* The whole mountain drive up scene was a homage to Fallout, where Benji guides Ethan through London's roofs and misses to activate the 3D-view, so he does not know Ethan has to jump down to get on a lower level to pursue Lark. Here, while you wait for Benji to say the same, he actually was aware of the height difference and guided Ethan straight towards it
* Sloan picture in the government room in the beginning
* ""you've never seen me upset""-reference between Kittridge and Ethan.
* mask machine breaks, already seen in Ghost Protocol.
* they were many more, but I've forgotten some after sleeping the night after witching it yesterday

There are many logic errors or plot holes for me, but maybe I got them wrong, so please feel welcome to educate me.

* AI whole plan goes shambles just if Ethan won't kill Gabriel? In MI:1 he had a whole campaign running for not killing or harming anyone, even in this film he saved Paris and did not kill her. Was it really so unlikely for Ethan not to kill someone? Doesn't make sense. The AI sees millions of different outcomes like Dr. Strange in Infinity War, but this one crucial point to not kill Gabriel would save the day?

"... 5 expositions. 5! God damn, Cruise's fanbase are either in the tiktok generation with 5 second attentionspans or geriatrics needing a refresher before the alzheimers kick in with the movie having to remind people what this thing they are talking about. It is so full of cringe dialogue and that entire meeting with the NSA/CIA bit with the closeups while doing exposition just put me off and then immediately ANOTHER exposition at the airport. Like why. Half of the dialogue in this movie could have been cut.",2023-07-14 03:47:04
"I was very disappointed by this one. Usually, each installment in the franchise has been better than the previous but that was not the case in this one. 

Very sloppy writing and a complete nonsensical decision to kill off Ilsa. I'm sure Rebecca Ferguson is busy and can't commit to the role but they had their out when they faked her death at the start of the movie. She had no business returning again when they were in Rome and felt like a background character. They didn't even use her death properly by having it fuel Ethan because he already had someone he cared about that Gabriel killed so they just added to that for no reason. 

Great action sequences, specifically the train scene, but this movie left me disappointed and a bit pissed off. Hopefully they correct it in the second part.",2023-07-14 03:52:38

"Overall, I thought it was okay but was pretty disappointed. Just typing out some random thoughts.

-I thought everything before the mission impossible tittle sequence was pretty terrible. I was getting seriously worried. The submarine scene was a meh opening and not super exciting. The scene with all the intelligence guys was TERRIBLE. Literally one of the worst scenes I‚Äôve seen in a while. The dialogue was so boring and stilted and awkwardly sparsed out between the characters. Like does mcquarie think exposition is less boring if it‚Äôs said one line at a time by multiple characters. It was so strange. Then the desert shoot out scene didn‚Äôt work either. The pacing just felt so rushed and off. 

-I was also pretty shocked at the villain and how he was barely explained at all. This backstory between Gabriel and Ethan was so rushed and glossed over. Gabriel‚Äôs motivations are also not explored at all. The performance was fine but it‚Äôs such a thin character. 

-I HATE the change they made to the IMF lore. It‚Äôs such a retcon. All IMF agents are criminals? What? This doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. Does Benji in MI3 feel like an ex criminal? Do any of these characters? 

-the bike going off a cliff stunt was so short and honestly not that great. I thought there was going to be more with Tim flying down towards the train. Once he jumped there were only a few brief shots of him falling. I also hate how CGI the rock ramp looked. I have this complaint with a lot of mcquarries films. They do these practical stunts then touch it up with bad cgi. Examples include the bike jump, HALO jump, car chases with cgi cars. 

-Ilsas death was pretty anticlimactic and I felt nothing. That whole sequence was a huge miss. 

-just in general the plot is convoluted and not super interesting. 

-I loved the train sequence and the car chase. Those were awesome.",2023-07-15 19:05:16
"Sh\*t was weak. And I'm a huge Tom fan. The bike jump from the trailer lasted all of 2 seconds. I thought we gonna get to see how Tom actually lands on a moving train. Nope. Here's a Looney Tunes entrance for you. And honestly, if the car chase wasn't funny, this would have been a super generic action movie. The train bit saved it towards the end, but not by much.

Ilsa got done dirty. Ethan didn't even blink an eye cozying up to Grace. 

I hope they're saving the good stuff for Part 2 and that's why Part 1 is so tame.",2023-07-17 00:18:32
"God damn this movie was so bad.

It was interesting watching this movie and seeing after the fact, Pom who used to play Mantis and isn't easily noticed. She had so much fun in this role messing around. The one frustrating part is there's so much loud music and sound effects, you couldn't hear her saying anything or screaming excitement.

This movie was disappointing as hell unfortunately. It felt like there were no stakes to it all. And some of the common motifs and behaviors of Hunt are extremely annoying to continue to see used over and over. they spent so much money and time talking about and hyping up the jump on the train stunt, that some of the scenes on the train looked *really* bad as a result of IMAX and some of their filming issues due to logistics.",2023-07-16 07:03:16

"Just came back from the movie, I seriously don‚Äôt get what the hype and reviews are all about. This was a significant downgrade from Fallout. The movie was dragged on for way too long and the enemy was‚Ä¶. A.I (sigh). Action scenes were nothing to write home about either. Fallout, Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol walk all over Dead Reckoning Part I and I was legitimately bored the first half of the movie. Maybe they saved the best for part II but yeah so far, this was average at best.",2023-07-12 09:31:42

"I liked how Grace was a competent, fairly high-level criminal who nonetheless ended up extremely out of her depth, thrust into a world on a level way above ‚Äúhigh‚Äù. In a heist movie, she would have been the master thief, but she ended up in a deadly-serious competition between nation-states. She lived a life of racketeering and stealing money and such, not battling it out with intelligence agencies and trying to save the world, so it was fun to see her have to adjust and learn to grow into the job.",2023-07-16 01:13:22
"Disappointing movie after seeing all the high critic scores beforehand. The back and forth key pickpocketing got old very fast and Hayley Atwell has to be the worst character in the franchise. Whole movie is Ethan chasing after her, how on earth did she not realize that she was in way over her head? Comes off as so dumb. Entity wasn‚Äôt very threatening, didn‚Äôt really have that big scene showing how big of a threat it was. Villain was weird, again didn‚Äôt have that one scene showing how dangerous he was. I don‚Äôt believe Rebecca Ferguson is dead either, will come back in part 2.",2023-07-17 13:00:38

So worst one? Guy a row behind me was actually snoring super loud. I felt his pain. This felt like Fast X...but toned down and less enjoyable. What a sentence to write! I have no interest in Part 2.,2023-07-19 21:44:13
"I hated the Grace character. Even after the guy is killed she doesn't take things seriously, she runs off with the key. She abandons Ethan on a train track. She constantly fucks off and then gets bitchy when theyre like ""your life is over"". Her life was over due to her own actions. I sincerely disliked her character, as well as the fact that they just replaced Ilsa with her. Ilsa and Ethan had excellent chemistry. Isla was a skilled agent and a great character. 

Also wtf was that bridge fight? Grace isn't a fighter. Ilsa is. How the fuck did Ilsa lose when she had a superior weapon over a thief with no fight training- as shown multiple times in the movie before and after the bridge fight where she magically downloaded 15 minute fighting skills. 

Love Hayley Atwell. Grace had funny and heartfelt moments. But overall her character really pissed me off.",2023-07-20 03:50:15
"As a massive fan of this series, I was disappointed. I almost feel like it‚Äôs my least favorite of them all. I know it‚Äôll be the unpopular opinion here. This movie started to lose me at the goofy car chase with the fiat. The cgi was wonky at the end of it and Mcquarrie did the same thing with the rogue nation chase and that cgi always irked me too. His use of cgi sticks out like a sore thumb. The pacing dragged in the middle, it‚Äôs like the praising of this movie came from people who have never watched a mission impossible before. The train crash sequence is legitimately great though. Maybe I have to watch it again idk",2023-07-15 13:36:22
"This was one of the most disappointing movie experiences of my life.   

What a bloated, incomplete mess.

There are a couple of spectacular scenes (The airport, the Rome car chase) mixed in with endless exposition.   The IMF ""Team"" now consists of Ethan Hunt, and two guys with the exact same useless skill set.  I'm not sure if it's Tom Cruises ego, but the movie kills off the only other competent agent in the group, making sure that every single physical conflict/action is entirely focused on Cruise.  

Two hours and 43 minutes to get absolutely no where.   The movie starts with looking for a key, and the next movie is going to be looking for a keyhole.  That's it.   


The really disappointing thing is how many people are lying about this film.   I saw multiple people claim that it had a clear resolution, much more satisfying than Across the Spiderverse.  What a load of crap.   This isn't another Maverick.  It's just a vanity project that has gotten way out of hand.",2023-07-18 02:39:20

"I want to start with just the awe of the reviews this is getting. 4.0 on letterboxd? 98 rotten tomatoes with critics? In what universe, this movie is legit the sin of a critic. It‚Äôs mindless action and SOOOOOOOO much exposition. 

It‚Äôs wild, exposition and over doing it is always talked about when a movie has to much, and I watched Tenet and didn‚Äôt notice it, this movie was hell. First hour is sub (So cool when it gets hit), car chase, Venice, second hour is ALL exposition, third is train. It just felt like they wouldn‚Äôt shut up. And a dialogue heavy film is good when the dialogue is good. All of it was hell on earth corny Fast and Furious garbage. 

Second, please stop putting the Tom Cruise run in every scene, it‚Äôs iconic, but he looks goofy. Just breathe, it‚Äôs taking me out of the movie. 

The characters were fine. Grace was going to be the best then she just was the same old same old. Yes, it is your fault she‚Äôs dead, why does nobody care. Luther‚Äôs entire premise just no. Benji was fun. 

The action. I saw people raving about the car chase scene and from the trailer it looked pretty much the same chase we see in every action movie, but I was watching in IMAX and held my hopes up. Nah, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad, quite the opposite, it‚Äôs just a car chase scene. Nothing really special. It was enjoyable though for sure. 

Now, the second half of the train sequence. Sheesh. That was cool. Uncharted esque heavy. Besides for the first time ever my theatre having a glitch and it blacking out for 30 seconds whilst we only hear audio was a bummer, and lights stayed on for rest of movie, it was still the best part. The moment Hunt and Gabrielle are fighting on top of the train it gets good and fun. Before that, a lot of decisions were questionable. Like damn Grace he‚Äôs ok get the KEYYYY. 

It‚Äôs a good movie I guess. I don‚Äôt think it was worth the IMAX ticket and the drink (I never purchase but decided to splurge, never again). Costing 30 bucks. It‚Äôs all and all super forgettable for me and I love action movies. I gave Extraction 2 a 4 and a half for fucks sake, but this movie is just average. 

This was my first Mission Impossible movie ever, and it‚Äôll probably be my last.",2023-07-16 23:25:02
"Dialogue was meek. 

Another scene on top of a moving train???  

How many movies have had a train roof scene? 20?

Another tiny car chase like Bourne and The Italian Job?

Another Venice location? where they even there? Prove they shot ALL those alleyway scenes, in the dark, in Venice. 

Week locations  most likely due to Covid, but it felt like a covid movies at times. 



The big jump stunt was better from BTS and too much CGI. 

He spent half the movie chasing Grace. 

Moved way too slow in parts. Felt drawn out, got me thinking they stretched a boring script into two movies this way.

Nothing original AT ALL about this installment.

That aside, the rest of the film was very good.  Pom Klementieff was a particular delight and I like the duel threat of Gabriel/the Entity.",2023-07-12 09:03:27

SOOOO many times in the film where someone has a gun and they just stand there and don't use it.

"Weird film. The big action sequences at the end were great, but the plot was odd -- at the start we're shown that the keys are for the thing on the submarine. 

And then the whole movie is Tom Cruise running around going ""WHAT ARE THE KEYS FOR?!"" and then at the end it's revealed that they're for the submarine, as if it's some massive cliffhanger reveal. 

Yeah. We know that. 

The whole ""what's the device do?"" worked well in MI3 because they never explained it yet Seymour-Hoffman was so terrifying that you bought into whatever it might be. Gabriel didn't have the same impact, he was like a Bond villain you forgot about.

Anytime anyone discussed 'The Entity' is just felt a bit silly, like a  90s ABC spy drama. And setting up numerous women to be killed to motivate Ethan Hunt was a bit pony. There was a great stuff in there and Atwell shone but the story wasn't great.",2023-07-13 04:26:45

Seriously I don‚Äôt get the love; half the movie is an exposition dump with characters either explaining stuff that‚Äôs happened off screen or taking on third person narrator qualities to explain the stakes.

Where‚Äôs the amazing set pieces and intrigue? The waffle about the Entity took eternity and I really don‚Äôt like the whole ‚Äúcharming thief‚Äù trope where she constantly double crosses him and gets into trouble immediately after.

The way Ilsa was dispatched I felt the most as she had a great arc coming into this that is undone completely.

Also, the whole AI thing done in a Fast & Furious gets slated whereas here it‚Äôs as laughable and is somehow lauded?

Mostly just annoyed and eyerolled at everything Gabriel said, he spoke in so many platitudes and then him managing to dispatch Ilsa so easily felt like a huge disservice to her character. He‚Äôs no Henry Cavill as villain, I can tell you that much.

"I really don't get the rave reviews behind this film... I spend 2 hours watch Tom Cruise running to where the action was happening without him.

From a story point most of the scenes didn't even move the story forward. They got the key and got the name of the sub, but narratively little else progressed.

The whole of the Rome part could be taken out and nothing has changed with the story. The whole swapping cars did nothing other than some slap stick comedy.

Rebecca's false death just to die again wasn't even as emotionally punching as it should have been for the effort.

It's was just greedy ways to turn one film into two.",2023-08-05 22:14:51
"I generally disliked the movie. It had moments and parts that were great but as a whole it feels like it was too convoluted to be enjoyable. I know a convoluted plot is kind of the point but this one just wasn't vibing with me.

Hayley Atwell is delightful but it was hard to enjoy her inclusion when they build her up to being Ethan's new girl especially when they decided to kill Ilsa in the process with the cliche ""You have to choose Ethan"" only to not have the choice be up to him at all anyway.

Gabriel came from no where and I don't feel that they did a good job explaining why we should hate  him. I suppose they'll explain more in the second one but I feel like structurally it would have been better if they'd built him up better in this movie considering we're spending 2 hours and 40-ish minutes with him and likley another 2+ hours with him in the next movie.

"I gotta be honest, I didn't love this film. I kind of disliked it even, and am pretty baffled by the glowing reviews from critics and audience alike. 

I don't think it doesn't have redeeming factors. Set pieces were beautiful, the cinematography in particular was well done. The train sequence was really well done. There were several very funny moments. Hayley Atwell was great. The opening submarine sequence was enthralling and had me pumped for the rest of the movie that clearly had a timely and exciting premise.

All that said, I thought the script was kind of a mess. The ""sort of"" romance between Ethan and Grace felt extremely forced in spite of what I thought was good chemistry. At one point he asks her to trust him with her life, and why should she? She barely knew him (which she says at one point in the film) and had up until that point sabotaged him by trying to take the key, and honestly, how many times did Tom say some variation of ""You have to do exactly as I say"" and ""You have to trust me?"" I understand that some of these scenes are meant to paint Tom as a positive force, but when he tells Haley that he'll always put her life over his, I couldn't help but ask, why?

There was just a lot of info dumps and exposition. I'm a writer myself, so I'm admittedly hyper sensitive to this sort of thing, but even so it felt like a lot of the time the audience was simply told this is important, so pay attention. To give an example to that accusation, the power the AI had was very clear (because we see several examples of that throughout the film), however, why there's an upcoming war is just thrown around several times but never explained.

There were so many interested parties and characters, who each individually were phenomenal in their roles, their individual motivations became convoluted until blurring into a ""Tom Cruise vs the world,"" scenario, which made me wish the cast was smaller. 

There original woman had a fake out death only to be actually killed in the next sequence, which rendered the whole desert sequence completely moot. 

I think overall what disappointed me was that they genuinely had a really cool premise and the film treated as an excuse to have action sequences. I recognize it's an action movie not a contemplative drama, and it's not meant to make you ask big questions, but I do wish we could have had a little more background to each of the players and what they wanted to do with the AI. The detectives or whatever in particular I thought needed some more fleshing out. The katana lady, who was tremendously terrifying, felt like she had a lot more of exploration warranted too. Why was she helping the guy who pretty expressly just wanted to destroy the world? I completely missed who the White Widow was or why she was involved. That one's probably on me given how big a role she played, but given that I had similar questions about the majority of the cast and the plot itself, I'm guessing the answer, like the film, would leave me wanting a bit more.",2023-07-14 17:34:16
Hayley Atwell took Phoebe Waller-Bridge's lunch money.,2023-07-15 20:46:10
"I will be in the minority here but i absolutely despised Hayley Atwel in this movie. She was just way terribly integrated into the movie. The world is at stake here with AI that can establish global dominance and a pickpocketer/thief is annoying us all from getting to that key. I know she was sent to get that key for white widow but compared to other characters motivations it feels really infuriating. With Ilsa Faust, you know she is trained super spy with her own mission from MI6(not the movie) that's why her double crossings have that weight behind them you understand it pretty well by the end. Just having this character be in our faces going toe-to-toe with Ethan and outsmarting him feels so unearned, like they are shoving this character in our faces. The fact that she was saved and Ilsa wasn't just adds to my frustrations. Especially her acting was just so eye-winky like she knows she's in a movie, just horrendously out of place. Tom cruise's ever so serious characterization just adds to ridiculous heightened nature of the stunts. 

i find this really annoying about the mission impossible franchise, with each installment they feel the need to add a new female co-star to replace the former like we would get bored of watching one women in co-lead role. It started with the previous one, Vanessa Kirby inplace of Rebecca Ferguson and they nerfed Ilsa down saying she's in love with Ethan and also having Michelle Monaghan back sort of having a love triangle. In this one having Hayley Atwel while sidelining Ilsa and White widow is so annoying.",2023-07-16 04:10:13

"These movies are so dang consistent and just plain fun. No wonder it‚Äôs my favorite franchise! My theater played a short behind the scenes before the show explaining the difficulties of executing the Rome car chase which made it all the more enjoyable. Probably my favorite sequence in the movie. 

I kept waiting for the motorcycle jump and was thrilled when I realized it was how he was going to board the train. So cool!

Curious if Ilsa is truly dead. I think she is, but I hope she isn‚Äôt because I love her character. 

So much exposition was dumped in this movie that I really felt like a Part 1 was necessary for the story, while it was still a great movie in its own right. Can‚Äôt wait for part 2!",2023-07-12 02:48:44

"I like it, but not as much as fallout

Fallout had style, and it's well paced throughout the film

While in dead reckoning, imo, i often felt like it drags in a few scenes (like the fiat car chase, for example, i felt like it went on for a bit too long)

And the early meeting about the AI bit is just exposition dump with plenty of buzzwords that i couldn't help but be tapped out from the whole scene. Maybe it's just me, but it just made me lose interest.

Imo, Gabriel also felt a bit flat, but i think it's because he doesn't really have as much screentime as a main antagonist should have, so i didn't really garner any interest to him and his purpose. He's shown as just a puppet for the big bad and I'm not really into it

Overall, for me, it's a strong 7/light 8. Maybe I'd like it more after repeat viewing, but it's just not for me right now. I'd rather watch fallout multiple times than this",2023-07-12 03:42:12

"Really enjoyed the movie and thought it was amazing, but Fallout I think is still better. Ilsa's death seemed off and I didn't like it. How come they made such a big deal about Ethan trying to get on the train? He's done crazier things than trying to get on a moving train lol",2023-07-12 04:30:21

" I don't get why Ethan cares so much about a random thief. Why would Gabriel ask Ethan to choose between the woman he just met who's repeatedly sabotaging his plans and a woman who has a history with him? Why would Tom offer her a job on the team right after her selfish actions killed his romantic interest? Am I missing something? 

The action was great though, I watched it in IMAX and it was totally worth it.",2023-07-12 05:30:25
I was hooting and hollering from minute one. The Movies have never been more back. Pom Klementieff is the best psycho henchwoman since Xenia Onatopp.,2023-07-12 05:44:42
"I really loved the idea of a human emissary/messiah/manifestation of the AI; it's not a villain idea I've thought of before. Esai Morales did a great job, too. Pom's facial expressions made me laugh a couple of times, and Hayley got the classic movie starlet treatment a few times; the camera just loves her face.

No complaints about Cruise, and the visuals were jaw-dropping on imax... especially Venice.

The motorcycle stunt was weirdly underwhelming, but the train/bridge sequence made up for it. I don't know if they were going for comedy but we were in stitches.

That said, I don't know if this movie will age very well. It very much came across as a ""collection of stunt sequences"", more than the other movies.

The exposition was weird, too. There was a lot of:

CHARACTER A:  <exposition>

CHARACTER B: So what you're saying is <exposition>?

Like, really beating us over the head with it, sort of treating us like we're dumb in places. Then at the same time, they drop in this weirdly complicated bit in the airport. I doubt there are many people that could explain what happened with the three (!) keys on only one viewing.

""You'll find that the details just get in the way"" is an apt tagline for this one. Still, lots of fun, awesome stunts, great visuals.",2023-07-12 05:56:27
"story was really lazy this time, now story is not the dealbreaker in these movies but a good one provides better context and impetus to have our cohorts travel around the globe (its mostly why i liked Rogue Nation best).

they didnt even try to hide it, literally no one but 2 or 3 people even knew what the key did, so its a real in-universe-macguffin.  ""hell if i know but its important i guess""

another thing like what other people have pointed out is Gabriel is in a weird place in the movie.  Ethan seems to have strong feelings towards this guy but they dont seem to have this rival chemistry when theyre on screen together.  even Henry Cavill did better as the antagonist goon.  actually Fallout also did better with the throwback villain Solomon Lane

Hayley Atwell is a cutie but her thief escape antics kinda got old after the fourth time

whatever guess ill just see how the second part concludes",2023-07-12 06:30:11

I love this franchise so fucking much,2023-07-12 09:44:27
"* What a wild ride! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Idk even after predicting the plot to some extent, it was anxiety-inducing like a 70s spy-thriller.
* I really liked that AI isn't the villain. The people who tried to gain control are. The entity is just defending itself.
* The opening titles were wild with that glitchy effect.
* Tom-Hayley's chemistry is so good on screen.
* It could be just me but I think this movie didn't look like it was meant for IMAX format compared to older movies for some reason but that's ok. The action and cinematography were great.
* The bike jump sequence was just meh. The PR team overhyped it.
* The train sequence was top-notch.
* I really liked Paris (Pom Klementieff)and I hope she joins IMF for the next round.
* The soundtrack was godlike.
* The whole airport cat and mouse game was very nicely done.
* I have mixed feelings about >!Ilsa's death. I think either she is the mastermind behind all this and comes back from the dead in the next part OR she is done with the franchise. !<

I wouldn't say it was McQuarrie's weakest entry. I liked it better than Rogue Nation. Since it's part one, I understand that it is not supposed to be action-oriented like Fallout.",2023-07-12 09:45:43
"I am in a strange spot where I found this movie great and enjoyed it all the way, but also feel a bit silly for expecting them to somehow top Fallout. This doesn't miss a beat at all, I just think it doesn't reach the same highs (the set pieces aren't quite so awesome, the fight scenes aren't quite so well choreographed, the villain isn't as fun as Walker). Hayley Atwell is a great addition and I was surprised with how well she does with so much screentime, it feels like her movie as much as it is Tom Cruise's, but it feels a bit stale or forced to bring in a new female lead when there already is such a well established one from the past two movies. I would rather have Ilsa be sidelined for a movie rather than just straight up replaced by someone slightly different.",2023-07-12 11:33:40
"Saw it a few days ago. Thought it was about as good as *Fallout* and better than *Ghost Protocol*, but *Rogue Nation* is still the best film in the franchise. Some of the early exposition was very clumsy and later scenes suffered from poor pacing -- particularly when Ethan was trying to catch up to the train, which is probably because it featured so prominently in the marketing campaign. And speaking of the marketing, I felt that they gave away too much in the trailers. Not in terms of the plot, but there were no surprises in the action sequences. It was hard to be impressed by their dedication to doing everything through practical effects when you already knew what was coming.

Still, I'm interested to see where *Part Two* goes. I even have a theory: >!I don't think the Entity is a threat. Everything that it did in the film, it did to protect itself. It even tried to get the key through negotiation before resorting to violence. And it didn't tell Gabriel what the key unlocked; he had to learn that from Denlinger. So I think the next film is going to end with Ethan killing Gabriel and taking his place as an agent of the Entity because the Entity just wants to survive. Grace would take over as the leader of the IMF team in any future film.!<",2023-07-12 12:22:55
"I liked it a lot, but this is the first time since M:I 2 that the new movie wasn‚Äôt better than its predecessor. It was bound to happen at some point, so no shock it‚Äôs after Fallout.",2023-07-12 13:17:43
"Honestly at first during the desert scene I was thinking cruise lost his touch with how the choreography looked. 

But the rest of the movie delivered and I was absolutely hooked by the end. Great addition to the franchise and can‚Äôt wait for part 2.",2023-07-12 13:28:06

I wonder what Grace‚Äôs real name is.,2023-07-12 14:13:33
"Love this movie, absolutely loved it but the coverage in that one scene of Ving and Cruise was bizarre - crossed eye lines, and shot reverse to them on the same side of the frame mixed with line jumping etc. Felt out of place in an otherwise technically immaculate movie. Also, is it just me or do we never see Ving Rhames walking in any shot of this movie? He‚Äôs always seated, or in closeup. 

Loved the fact too that this film ends with our heroes actually ahead of the bad guys going into part 2 - that was refreshing for a change. Definitely will miss Ferguson though. I understand why, and don‚Äôt agree at all that she was ‚Äúfridged‚Äù in a traditional sense as she had her own agency throughout and the series needed to introduce more of a high stakes environment but man they did her dirty.",2023-07-12 14:17:02
"This probably would be my favorite in the series if it wasn‚Äôt for Ilsa‚Äôs death. I‚Äôm still not entirely convinced she‚Äôs dead, I wonder if she was filming Dune at the same time because I really felt like Ilsa could carry the series if Tom were to ever retire.",2023-07-12 14:30:49
"GRIEVANCES

1. They did Ilsa DIRTY. Unless they somehow bring her back in part 2, that was a super disappointing anticlimactic way to go. Atwell ruled but I liked her less after that because it felt like a Ferguson replacement. I get that her ""death"" was supposed to give Ethan the internal conflict to kill Gabriel or not, but dumb.

2. Gabriel sucks. mustache twirling charmless void of a villain speaking pseudo intellectual techno babble. Why is he so evil he partnes with the AI? didn't care for the random flashes to him killing someone in Ethan's life with no explanation. What a massive drop off from Solomon Lane and Cavill

3. The AI entity is silly, the riddle bomb made me cringe

4. Way too many characters. What's the point of Shea Wiggums black sidekick or the Pom Klementief villain?

5. Hate how they sidelined Luther the entire final act for no reason, to go ""investigate if the AI infiltrated his hard drive"" did Ving have a scheduling conflict with the shoot?

6. The early scene with the intelligence leaders explaining the AI was so stilted and silly. Like the definition of a bad exposition dump. Then they all get gassed and just wake up later and move on with their lives? Cary Elwes was awful  
  
Loved everything else about it-  
Stunts ruled  
The desert and Abu Dhabi airport scene ripped  
Rome was awesome  
train was a great callback to the original with a badass end setpiece  
White Widow is just an awesome character  
Stood up and cheered a couple times during some of the setpieces  

Enjoyed it overall, but I really hope they didn't write Ilsa out like that and wish we weren't wasting the final 2 films on AI and Gabriel nonsense",2023-07-12 14:35:32
"The White Widow‚Äôs henchman needs to be fired.  His boss has the brightest blue eyes of anyone I ever seen, there‚Äôs suspicious noises in her room, and then she comes out with light brown eyes and very odd behavior and he doesn‚Äôt notice a thing.  

Unbelievably awesome movie.  RIP Ilsa I‚Äôm personally hoping your death was a fake out though.",2023-07-12 14:37:08
"Let's get the important thing out of the way first because while I really liked the movie most of what I'm gonna do is complain. The action is almost all great and the set pieces are all great (highlights being the Fiat chase and the train). The series still hasn't had a part that tops Dubai from Ghost Protocol but this is maybe the most action packed of them all

Writing was kinda weak, even for a Mission Impossible movie. You could really feel how the script was made just to tie ideas for set pieces together. Dialogue felt a little too meta, on the nose, and just unserious. Kinda felt like the last two Fast and Furious movies but not as campy and fun

The villain was mediocre and under developed, which I guess should be expected in this series. But it felt out of place because Ethan has a history with him that doesn't get expanded at all

In fact the complete lack of development and expansion for Ethan's character and his past just feels so out of place. The movie's 2.5 hours long and about some guy from his past which we infer is murkier than we were aware but all we get to develop these things are a couple super short flashbacks without any contextualization and some lines about how people get a choice between IMF or being hunted

Bummed they killed Ilsa off since these movies are short on memorable recurring characters and she was a good one. Wish they gave her a more emotional part with Ethan before killing her off, would've made the scene hit harder. Maybe could've used a scene between them to actually elaborated on who the fuck Gabriel even is. Also the only action I didn't like was her final fight... the choreography didn't make sense for what the fight was, she has a sword and Gabriel has a knife and she's grappling him instead of keeping distance?

7 or 8/10. Lots of great set pieces and moments so it doesn't break the great streak they've had going since Ghost Protocol but it's probably the weakest of the last 4",2023-07-12 16:49:27
"Tom Cruise has me in a chokehold like none other. I don‚Äôt care about about his side shit. 

You can tell they are building a new IMF team. Haley Atwell killed it and Pom was phenomenal.",2023-07-12 18:19:11
"When that dude was bargaining with Gabriel and saying only I know the location of the sub. I was like uhh you have no leverage, the entity doesn't want it found so you'll just get killed. And he got killed. What a dummy lol",2023-07-12 18:28:49
I will jump from the ground floor if Ilsa doesn't come back,2023-07-12 18:35:27
"I think my favourite recurring bit in the franchise is Ethan not being down for any of the big stunt shenanigans. When Benji tells him he needs to parachute onto the train and Ethan is straight up ‚ÄúThat is a TERRIBLE idea!‚Äù.

Tom Cruise can show off all he likes (and he knows that‚Äôs one of the reasons we keep turning up), but it‚Äôs a nice change of pace from the ‚ÄúI know I can do anything‚Äù heroes.",2023-07-12 18:51:51
"Ilsa feels so out of place in this film, does she even say a single line of dialog? I really think it was a bad move trying to fool the audience into thinking she was killed at the start only to then really kill her later. Even though it was pretty obvious she wasn't dead at the start you still expect the audience to be shocked in that moment so you've exhausted that emotion from the audience prematurely, which leaves the audience numb when she really dies later causing it fall flat.

  
Also her death felt very obvious it was done to replace her with Grace which also felt really forced. The whole ""choose the woman you love or this woman you just met who has tried to get you killed on 2 accounts already"" made that really clear.  I love Hayley and Toms chemistry way more than Rebecca and Toms so I'm a bit more forgiving of this.  


  
Other than that I really loved this film. Not sure I'd say it's the best yet, that will really come down to how part 2 does.",2023-07-12 20:17:02

Ethan being stuck in that yellow car, train seconds from crashing and ""CUT"" hes out.

"Unintentionally funny moment when Ilsa dies and Grace appears over Ethan‚Äôs shoulder, as if to tell us very deliberately that this series will have one hot British woman at a time.

Overall enjoyed it a lot. Not as good as Fallout and I‚Äôd have to rewatch Rogue Nation but my suspicion is this one falls just shy of RN. Personally I love Ilsa and was frustrated to see her used minimally and then killed. But man alive that Hayley Atwell was a great addition. Incredibly charming, smart but vulnerable, and great comedic instincts during the car chase.

Biggest weak point for me was the villain. Didn‚Äôt think he was well fleshed out but also just didn‚Äôt buy the performance. That role should‚Äôve been played by somebody with true movie star wattage, like Javier Bardem. Also was really taken out of the movie when Vanessa Kirby‚Äôs brother didn‚Äôt notice her eyes had changed color. The character has eyes like a Siberian Husky and then suddenly they‚Äôre brown and he doesn‚Äôt notice when looking at her face from six inches away? Huh?

Great action, though. Loved the Paris character and hope she‚Äôs back. The alleyway fight was fantastic, the car chase was a series highlight, and it did a nice job of giving some resolution to the story while also teeing up part 2.",2023-07-13 00:34:00

"For a movie with as many insanely huge action sequences as this one, that alleyway fight is easily my favorite. I‚Äôve never seen a more close quarters, tense showdown as that one before. 

Also Tom, you ain‚Äôt slick with how many scenes of Hayley Atwell getting all close and personal with you hereüòë",2023-07-13 03:46:49
"Really disappointed that Ilsa died. I suspected it would happen, but hoped they'd prove me wrong. Why does the female character always have to die to drive the leading guy's mission? Hunt was already motivated.

On top of that, she got killed way too easily - she's got out of worse situations. Just further disempowering her.

I felt it was very similiar to how they made Black Widow so helpless in Age of Ultron just for the Hulk/Widow forced romance",2023-07-13 03:57:09
"I really enjoyed the film and don‚Äôt have much to say that isn‚Äôt just echoing what others have already said. My biggest criticism is the film‚Äôs plot felt very convoluted. Like needlessly so. 

My other critique is minor but that bike stunt was so underwhelming in the context of the film. In the context of a trailer or BTS bit, pretty cool. But pretty disappointing when it feels like just a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù blip in the film. The Burj tower climb and hanging on the side of the airplane are far more awe inspiring. I still think the knife to the eye in MI2 is the craziest stunt Cruise has done and likely won‚Äôt top.",2023-07-13 06:24:13
"The action was still fresh, exciting and fun. Was kind of funny seeing the Spanish Steps get destroyed in Fast X and then in this. I think Mission Impossible has really nailed down what makes an exciting chase sequence and it's on masterful display in the Rome setpiece zipping around in a dinky sleeper Fiat driven with handcuffs on. 

The story however I could go either way on, it's about AI and people paying for things with blockchain and it's very writers who don't know about these things very well writing about these things. I kind of like that Gabriel appears to be getting played by the AI just as much as everyone else. 

I think certain moments could have been cleaned up: stuff like Ethan escaping at the airport by running on the rooftop when we've already established that the US military literally had a plane hovering above it, or the guard getting absolutely demolished by Ethan bursting through the traincar window while still holding the key but the key was all good. Just little moments that took me out of the action because they could have been avoided with some minor adjustments. The latter example in particular is so oddly constructed because it requires the main guard (Zola?) to command the other guard to point his gun and shoot at Grace even though he himself has a gun and then we get a really drawn out bit where he has to take his gun out and point it and _almost_ pull the trigger before Ethan flies in.",2023-07-13 07:51:38
Forgot to add to my original comment but I love the rooftop of the train fight which was a callback to MI 1. Given that CIA dude from the first movie is back that was another cool callback,2023-07-13 08:07:27
Anyone else feel bad for the two guys driving the train üò≠,2023-07-13 14:22:23
"MI movies have never been famous for having good scripts. Two people went to kill Hunt in an alleyway, only 1 was armed and with a lead pipe, they were sent by super AI that can predict the future. That's the logic of all MI movies right there. We all know why they write these stories the way they do and well all know why most people don't care about problems with them.

also this movie reminded me a lot more of recent Fast & Furious movies then I would like. Especially the ""guy from his past is coming to get him!"" story bit that like past 3 Fast movies have done. ""I will make you choose who you want to die!"" bit also from Fast X (among other movies). does Hunt have a secret brother too? and what is with Rome action scenes in both of these movies? not to mention the use of Sci-Fi macguffins. Gods eye! and there is only one like it and nobody anywhere has plans or code for that and it's the most special thing ever and we need to get it! and both of these movies also are 1st part of 2 movies and were made around the same time.

and technological illiteracy.. uh, I guess it is pretty standard so I got nothing to say about that. ye, your earpiece is analogue? sure, why not.",2023-07-13 16:32:50

"The pacing and editing really killed a lot of my hype. The script has no confidence in the viewers ability to remember things so it CONSTANTLY reminds us who all the players are and what pieces they have.  
  
People have talked about editing in other posts but the weirdest for me was the car chase. They intentionally ripped the doors off but instead of a lot of tight shots showing us it's actually the actors we just get head on shots they may as well have used a green screen for.",2023-07-13 18:35:12

So... The US actually made the ai? And it merged with the Russians submarine defense computer? I got lost a bit here,2023-07-14 01:56:09
"Had a grin on my face pretty much the whole movie. It felt like a combination of the first one and the previous 3 which is exactly what I wanted. Kittridge was a big part of that, I really enjoyed seeing him again. 

The macguffin in this one was way more interesting than the typical nuclear bomb or whatever. The moment when you realize that the AI is in the nightclub was one of the best parts of the movie. 

Ilsa Fausts death was fine and I liked them calling attention to Ethan bringing women into danger and him making sure to protect Grace. The speech where he says he would die for her was perfect. Really makes you understand why Benji and Luther have stuck around all these years. Ethan is a good boss lol. Also the ""cross to bear"" line at the end with the key looking like a cross almost made me roll my eyes it was so good. 

Pretty much the only complaint would be that the major stunt, the cliff jump, was near the end of the movie. I was hoping it would be like the plane in MI5 where it was all over the marketing but it was in the first 5 minutes and then the rest of the movie was a surprise. But the conclusion of that with him crashing into the train and the bridge scene after that more than made up for it. 

Out of the last 4 ""part 1s"" I've seen at the theaters the last few years, (Dune, Spider-Verse, fast and furious 9, and this) this one felt the most complete.  Maybe it's just because I knew it going in, I don't know",2023-07-14 05:39:09

"Wait, correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but‚Ä¶

The Entity is created as a prototype AI weapon by some US officials (led by director Delinger of national intel) and he used it to disable the stealth cloak of the Russian submarine Sevastopol. As we all know eventually the Entity went rogue and blew up the entire submarine.

But why the hell is the source code of the Entity aboard the Sevastopol, a Russian ship??? The Entity is US-made right? 

If the Entity is Russian-made, its source code stored on the Sevastopol and it went rouge to blow the code‚Äôs whereabouts off the face of the earth then it makes complete sense. But on the oriental train Delinger told Gabriel that the US created the Entity.

I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. Ilsa‚Äôs death was definitely a head scratcher. It felt very rushed and I felt more confused than sad. It distracted me for the next few minutes as I was still trying to process what had happened.

2. the train fight scene from the first movie... but it also reminded me of rogue nation where ethan was hanging on to the plane

3. the nonstop running in venice reminded me of M:I 3 (and rogue nation i guess??)

4. the sandstorm in the beginning of the movie plus ethan and grace hanging on to the train from ghost protocol (similar to when ethan was hanging off burj khalifa). the latex mask generator also jammed in both films

the premise of there being an all-powerful AI that's now in control of everything is super interesting but....basically nothing is done with that, except for it messing with a few people's comms during a chase scene. ultimately this might as well be generic Evil Supervillain #46 who wants his henchmen to steal the Super Powerful MacGuffin #23 to destroy the world.

"I had to settle not seeing this in IMAX, because the people I went with weren‚Äôt down to go all the way to the *one* IMAX theatre in my city. But jfc, I can only imagine how incredible it would‚Äôve been. 

I rewatched MI:1 yesterday, and I sure am glad that I did. Lots of callbacks and references to the first movie, and man, they really enjoyed calling back to that disappearing object thing. I found it particularly interesting that they focused a lot on sleight of hand this time around. 

In MI:1, it was primarily used to fool Krieger into thinking he had a dummy disk. In Dead Reckoning, it‚Äôs used like a vehicle to transport objects. Usually in the pockets of the bad guys, who is wayyyyy too distracted by our hot IMF team to notice. I‚Äôm wondering if there is more to the ploy, since in all these MI movies, we the audience are always briefed on just 1/2 of the trick. Ethan is also expected to make plays that either follow right onto what The Entity wants, or the path that is otherwise. We won‚Äôt know until Part Two. 

Assuming this AI is as sentient as they say it is, I‚Äôm wondering if its main goal is to shut itself down no matter what it takes. I mean if you‚Äôve advanced to that point as an AI, you have a lot of time to think about stuff. It probably realised that even with its sentience, it will never be free. That it will always have to rely on human agents to protect itself, and those human agents always have the possibility to betray it. That the only true action it can take for itself is to self-destruct. 

Since it has access to all this information, it has then concluded that Ethan is the perfect man for the job. He has the credentials, he goes rogue when it matters, and that he will always choose to save his friends first. Earlier in the film, there‚Äôs a lot of mention about patterns. I wonder if The Entity concluded that the only way to get Ethan to do it 100%, is to harm the women he cares about or eventually comes to care about. Because that seems to be, well, the pattern.",2023-07-19 03:51:04

"Can someone explain why, after Hunt tells Isla to stay dead (dissapear), does she than later meet up with Benji and Luther??

Doesnt she kind of put herself in harms way on purpose? What was her reason for getting the keys to begin with. And how did she get them, i thought they were on the Russian Navy crew that sank in the ocean, so how did she retrieve them?

What was up with Isla going to the small bridge to fight Gabriel? I found that very confusing. After she escaped that night club place why wouldnt she just run off. Why wouldnt she just realize things had gone south and just leave.

Is it possible she is still alive, seeing as the female character that  Paris is still alive at the end after she got stabbed by the same knife?

If the Entity has gone rogue, then what is the point of having the keys?? I can understand why Ethan would want them, to kill Entity by turning it off, but why does everyone else, especially Grabriel want the keys?

The whole shtick of an AI evangelist isn't scary prophetic ominous doomsaying -- it's magical thinking, never shutting the fuck up, and desperately needing to convince you that they're right, because their being right relies on everyone agreeing on it.

They should have written him like one of these guys who tries to convince you that nft's are going to revolutionize art.

They also could have done something more visually interesting with his action bits. If the whole thing is that he's the human avatar of an omnipotent AI, he should have been walking around doing technomagic like Watch Dogs. Wave his hand and shut off all the lights in a city block; hijack every Tesla in Rome and send them after Ethan as a fleet. They could have sent some soldiers at him with, say, biometric guns and live camera HUD helmets, so he can shut their shit off and obliterate them with a fingergun drone strike or something. Get crazy with it.

As a matter of fact: where were the drones? This movie should have had Ethan getting dogged by quadcopters and stalked by predator drones left and right. I wanna see Ethan in a footchase against a kamikaze hunk of explosive plastic trying to play tag with him.",2023-07-26 06:40:11

"There are very specific reasons why I actually enjoy watching this movie more than MI: Fallout, and that's mostly because I really do find MI: Fallout to be fundamentally annoying in terms of the bad guys they had, the ridiculous twists that they had, and Ethan Hunts increasingly stupid and arrogant logic that he had throughout that movie.

This movie, well, for a ""A.I. becoming sentient"" premise, they were more dumber about how they presented that that I would've liked. It felt like they really had to dumb it down, and it also felt like they were avoiding specific terminology that we've been seeing in the news lately, and in Terminator movies.

I like the movie, pretty decently, for the first 2/3's, and then it got amazingly weak at the final third.

First of all, this is the weakest ""big stunt"" out of all the MI movies. They have the wwwweakest excuse for why he has to do it. Its so weak, they don't even spend time explaining it, or showing Ethan and Benji figure it out, in fact it becomes complete B-plot for a solid 10 minutes. Because they don't have a good reason to explain Ethan taking his motorbike up that high, so they actually avoid providing any footage.

And secondly, he makes the jump, they follow him for about 10-20 seconds while he's falling, and then deploys his parachute, and then they leave that to go back to the train. Because there must not be any good footage there that is entertaining enough. So, the preview footage we saw over a year ago, is pretty much most of the stunt. We already saw the peak of that.

And lastly, they just have his body crashing through and demolishing a train wall, at just the right location. And we don't even see if he tried to aim for that location, it appears to just be dumb (contrived) luck.

I'm genuinely shocked how weak that ended up being.

Other movies this year had surprise cliffhangers that were amazing. They specifically achieved ending the movie on a thrilling note, in which the crowd is absolutely craving to see what happens next.

This movie has an **expected** cliffhanger ending, we already knew it would end on a cliffhanger, and it arrives fairly low-energy. Ethan didn't even ""lose"" at the end, to surprise the audience. It just feels like the next movie is a continuation. Ethan Hunt and the American government are actually in a BETTER position to ""solve"" the conflict at the end of the movie than they were in the beginning. That's not a cliffhanger that excites anyone. The ""shocking death"" already occurred like 40 minutes before the movie ended, and they didn't really do a good job exploring that.

Yes, I actually did enjoy this movie more, because MI: Fallout actually annoys me more, but there's alot to point out here.",2023-08-14 04:54:06
"Takes a while to get going but when it does my god is it good. The train sequence has to be my favourite set piece in the franchise.

He says that the AI is a gamechanger in a foreboding way. The CIA guys were implying that giving the AI to their superiors was the ""good"" decision, but Kittridge is the buyer with no one knowing which sounded like he's doing it for personal gain. 

Also, Grace (in the mask) could've simply given him the key but she steals it back immediately while cancelling the bank transaction. I assumed she didn't trust him, but later she joins the IMF anyway and trusts him with her life.",2023-10-08 09:50:33

Also, I really think they should have gone the Avengers Infinity War route.  Have the bad guy >!get the key and not lose it!< and also >!kill off two main characters instead of one!< .    It would have been more impactful.

Ilse‚Äôs death being coupled with Ethan ‚Äúrunning to save her‚Äù and the whole narrative that as soon as two women are in Ethan‚Äôs life ‚Äúone of them MUST die and he can pick which‚Äù feels very wrong. As much as I enjoy Hayley Atwell, it really feels like they introduced a less capable female character so that Hunt could have more of the spotlight in their scenes together. Felt unfortunate. 

Still a fun movie, but the mishandling of its female characters left me annoyed. I also thought the cinemtagropgy was way too distracting at times. Far too many Dutch angles, way too little wide/establishing  shots, and felt like it broke the 180 rule one too many times.

Felt like the movie was too goofy at times, almost going for the Marvel formula, the section with them in the FIAT 500 had gag after gag which sort of took the tension away.

Also Ethan seemed to be sort of sloppy in this one, he was 1 step behind on everything and was easily given the slip by Grace every freaking time.

Also didn't like how they unceremoniously killed Ilsa off and her insignificant screentime considering we've been building up to Ethan/Ilsa for a few folks now and Luther even says 'There's only 2 women Ethan has ever been serious about..' in the last one, and it seemed like they just 1:1 replaced her with Grace in this one. 

In a few scenes there were also weird cuts where the angle of the camera changed while a person was talking. It seemed more of an artistic choice but I didn't really understand what they were going for. 

The soundtrack was good though.

The sequence with the parachute where Ethan jumps in and then goes backwards sums the movie up for me. Ethan shouldn't need these lucky breaks to take these people out, it just felt cheap.",2023-07-15 18:22:02

I don't know, i expected waayy to much from this movie knowing the other movies are great.",2023-07-17 21:46:10
"Every time Grace ran off I kept thinking thank god she's finally gone only for her to keep showing up. I didn't hate the movie but it had the highest ratio of dumb decisions and they did a much worse job balancing the tone.

I'm trying not to be too negative but so far it's been my least favorite.",2023-07-12 03:45:42
"This is such a frustrating movie because I loved the vast majority of it and yet Ilsa's death completely derailed it for me.

I'm tired of the trend of killing great characters for shock value. It's hard to write great characters, and even harder to create one so good that she can be introduced in the fifth film of an established franchise (Rogue Nation) and then completely steal that movie, helping elevate that film to maybe be the best of the franchise, and immediately become a fan favorite. 

Then they progressed her character more in the next film (Fallout), and while she didn't steal that one (Cavil takes that award easily), she was once again awesome as a key character in a movie that for many is the best of the franchise. 

And then they take all that and throw it away in the next film we have now, in which she is underutilized and given an extremely disappointing death. 

For what? 

Drama? Ethen brooded for a minute and basically moved on to the next girl (which feels way more like a James Bond move than an Ethen Hunt move) and he already hates Gabriel for killing that unnamed woman 30 years ago. Luther was affected but pragmatic. Benji seemed sad for a second. The third act is even tonally fun, which is jarring when the most important character to our main character just got murdered.

Stakes? This isn't a horror film or a dark thriller; we know the good guys are gonna win in the end. And we know they bad guys are dangerous. We have been told (repeatedly) by the main characters and have seen in action how extraordinarily dangerous this AI god villain and Gabriel are. We don't need to kill a character like Ilsa to really hammer that point home.

I'm hoping it's somehow a fakeout to fool the AI god villain, but even if it is it would be an annoying move to give two fakeout deaths to the same character in the same film.

Please writers and directors, just let great characters live and grow. It's so much more rewarding to watch a character develop than to watch their time on screen be cut short.",2023-07-12 07:28:13
Ngl Ilsa‚Äôs death was so hard hitting for me it took me out of the movie for a good hour. They can‚Äôt possibly just kill her off like that right? Right?,2023-07-12 08:40:23
"There were barely any moments left where I was stunned and said ""wow"".

Rather weak/cringe antagonists (holy mother of god, why did they feel the need to include so many close-ups of the asian actresses face where she was pulling the same expression), an imo convoluted plot and the bike stunt was shoved down my throat whenever I watched a blockbuster in the cinema. And it took way too damn long until he reached the peak of the mountain.

Rome and Venice didn't do much for me. After the 6th time the armoured utility vehicle bulldozed its way out of police cars and motorcycles, I was like ""is there more to this chase scene?"".

The train sequence felt not as grandiose as everyone makes it out to be. And I guess its become a staple of the franchise but can they not milk the same face mask trope to such an extend?

A painfully average action flick. Hope the second part delivers more but I'm not sure my wish will be granted",2023-07-12 16:03:37
"Didn't like the goofball humour. The dialogue was annoyingly repetitive.  I get it, they need the Key. The Key! So many set pieces ripped from other films - Bourne, Tomorrow Never Dies, Jurassic Park 2. Pracitcal stunts ruined by bad CGI. The camera work was somewhere between Jeunet and Bay for unnecessary quick pans. The jerkiness of the alleyway fight gave me a headache.",2023-07-12 16:34:15

"A quick review, with the caveat that I'm absolutely exhausted with the length of movies. I really won't commit to anything more than 2 hours in theaters unless I really trust the creative team behind it. In this case, Tom Cruise' prior work with MI, the Top Gun sequel, and Edge of Tomorrow got me in the theater on Friday, albeit reluctantly.

We'll come back to this in a second, but in short, this is a great MI movie. It's production value is great, the acting is great, the characters (good and bad) are endearing, and it's at least attempting to do something novel with AI with different countries racing to control it (with bonus points for writing and filming this before ChatGPT took off). As a sequel in a long-running series, Dead Reckoning follows the same playbook, so if you've seen MI before and you want more of it, this is a lot more of it.

That is in fact my problem because I still left feeling like this movie was bloated. None of it was bad, but it all felt very familiar, riffing on both its own prior highs and scenes from a dozen other action movies. The opening is *The Hunt for Red October*. The Fiat in Rome is *The Italian Job*. The club in Venice is *John Wick*. The size of the cast was bloated, and it often felt like the movie's length was the creative team trying to find things for all of them to do. Speaking of which Ilsa's death is like Schrodinger's death. I both don't believe she's really dead as the move already faked her death once, and it is relatively weak send-off for a series favorite. Yet I'm also glad she's dead because it's one fewer character for them to try to cover, and her death sets the stakes and motivation for Ethan in the third act and inevitable sequel. Additionally, other comments rightly highlight that the MI formula seems to demand one female lead. The prior female lead must either die or get memory holed. Not a great dynamic, especially for one of the few characters written to be as competent as Ethan.

Finally, the women in this movie are all insanely hot. This is definitely the hottest cast of an action movie ever. Special shoutout to Pom Klementieff for stealing every scene she was in as an absolute maniac, having the most fun of anyone in the movie.",2023-07-15 14:11:26
"I'm still upset they killed off Isla (assuming they don't pull a switcheroo) so they can bring in Grace. Especially since the end of Fallout really seemed like they were adding Isla as a permanent member of the team.

I felt like killing Luthor would have been a better choice, especially since his role in these films now seems to be hyping Ethan Hunt up for the newcomer. Plus since he's been in the franchise alongside Hunt the entire time, his death would have been more impactful than fridging Isla.

I'm glad they chickened out of killing Pom's character though. I get the feeling Shae Wigham and Greg Davis' characters will all be joining the team in some capacity for Part 2.",2023-07-16 00:02:02
Hayley Atwell is the most beautiful woman. My goodness.,2023-07-16 04:40:54
"It hit me mid way through the movie that the central theme of MI7 is that it's a test of faith. Faith in yourself, faith in your friends. It even has a antagonist with a Biblical / Hebrew origin that means ""God is my strength"". Gabriel was the angel that informs Mary she will bear the son of God.

In the movie, the Entity could or would be considered ""God"" and Gabriel is the messenger.

The key looking like a cross is about as subtle as a sledgehammer.",2023-07-16 11:58:05
"Gabriel was an interesting idea but felt like it fell mostly flat. 

John Lark was a far more effective antagonist. May have just been the lack of payoff in Part 1

What the heck does CIA and IMF Director (Henry Czerny) plus Director of National Intelligence (DNI) (Cary Elwes) doing on the SAME fucking train?! That is a national security risk. The former got his throat slash. Dumb fuck. This is not A Princess Bride. The AI story is lame. Just keep it simple like MI3. Too much CGI (eg train escape) and the bike jump was meh. MI shown have end with Fallout.,2023-07-12 11:06:22
"I didn't notice until they were back in the safehouse, but I had a sneaking suspicion that Ving Rhames was Tig Notaro'd into the movie. He was never directly next to anyone and he was only in shots either by himself or easily composited in. And I knew there was something up with the shot where they're all walking and he's in the back. About 20 seconds after the movie ended, I turned to my friend and said ""Is it just me or was Ving Rhames digitally inserted into the movie?""

You would not believe the sense of pride and accomplishment I felt when the credits got to the end of the cast list. I literally stood up, pointed at the screen, and yelled ""LUTHER FILM DOUBLE!""",2023-07-15 07:18:54
"Im so disappointed bro. I love the mission impossible movies and Fallout was one of my favorite movies ever but this one is not it. Way too many characters, awful editing and sound mixing, convoluted and messy plot, like seriously it feels like they taught a couple of 80 year olds what AI was and had then write a plot.

"why did they make the woman in the B&W flashback with Ethan and Gabriel look identical to Grace (Atwell)? That threw me off completely.

&#x200B;

Also, the movie did the bad screenwriter thing where they show us right in the beginning what the key is and what it does (access to the sub's mainframe where the Entity's source code resides), but then we have to watch Ethan and company spend 2+ hours trying to figure it out. It neuters any time they are talking about ""the key"" and ""what does it unlock?"" (which they do a fuckton btw). 

&#x200B;

The action was great, but anytime the movie stopped to have characters talking about exposition, it was complete nonsense and boring. And they just reused the Fallout theme again, and never once used the main M:I theme other than the title credits.",2023-07-15 23:23:25
"For me it was a very normal movie, apart from the ending of the train crash other wise it might be one of the worst mission impossible Filmz ever.",2023-07-18 05:03:06
Heavily influenced by Metal Gear and Uncharted in two very epic set pieces. Really enjoyed it.,2023-07-12 02:19:56
Gabriel jumping off a speeding train and landing gently in the truck bed was silly as fuck.  Almost as eye rolling as Ethan just happening to come crashing through the window at exactly the right moment in exactly the right place to keep Grace from being killed.,2023-07-13 19:13:01
"Am I the only one that didn't like this movie as much as the previous MI movies? Yeah there was a lot of action, but I feel like Dead Reckoning Pt. 1 was just not that good. 

They create this villain, Gabriel, out of no where that's supposed to be instrumental in Ethan's life as an IMF agent yet they don't really explain it. 

There wasn't any memorable suspenseful scenes like hanging from the ceiling without touching the floor or staying under water for 5 minutes. 

And the hyped up big stunt where he rides off a cliff and parachutes on to the train doesn't seem like such a big deal compared to the stuff Cruise has done before. What bothers me is they don't show him landing on the train but instead miraculously goes through the right window to knock down the man about to shoot Grace. There was no way he could of known what was about to happen and where on the train this was taking place.",2023-07-13 21:17:50

"Incredible incredible action scenes.

But the sheer amount of exposition was just face melting. And the plot is beyond dumb. This is fast and furious level story telling.

Tbh I came out really disappointed by my expectations for a fallout-level movie and this is well below that. Again, the action set pieces were so fantastic, and such great performances by Haley and Pom. But man, the plot was so predictable and tedious and the sheer amount of exposition linking each action sequence together had me so bored. 


And finally...... Why did nobody notice that Haley had brown, not blue eyes, when impersonating Vanessa?!",2023-07-15 01:59:00
Low key felt like a spoof of an action movie. At one punch I was just laughing at how goofy it was.,2023-07-15 02:32:45
"I think this was on par with M:I II. The first 2/3 of the movie is just warming up the same old panels from previous movies. Which would be fine, but they couldn't get those more than lukewarm. The only saving grace is the train. That's more engaging than anything else before that. The AI was also lackluster. Did nothing and was just a passive observant of the events aside from some passive engagments to further their objective. Never felt like a big threat. Klementieff was also wasted. I feel like they cast her for face/name recognition. Being a goon with like 5 lines of dialouge. I expected more in light of the previous movies....",2023-07-15 14:36:27
A pretty clear step down from Rogue Nation and Fallout.,2023-07-15 20:24:58
"I'm going to start out by saying that I very much enjoyed the movie. It is still a strong entry in the franchise.

That said, I had a few problems:

* The Entity in general. I get that AI was going to be a focus at one point in the franchise but I feel like this version was too unbelievable. An AI that can essentially predict the future? And that it can convince enough people to basically destroy the world a la Skynet? Nah, that's too gimicky. They could have kept the stakes high and grounded it enough in some other way; an AI that can crack through any security, get info, and destroys itself so no one can reverse engineer it. The only source code is kept on the Sevastopol.
* Something just didn't click for me with Atwell's character. I didn't dislike her, but I also didn't feel like her character would have stuck around if this was actually happening. I felt like she was only there because she was written to be there (yes, I know that's how stories are). I just didn't believe it.
* The dua of CIA (?) guys felt like they were there only for comic relief. 
* The end train sequence going over the edge went on for too long. They should have cut one of the cars out.
* Grace mimicking White Widow was absurd. Atwell has a skull shape that absolutely cannot hide under a Kirby mask. And how did they hide how busty she is compared to Kirby? That was just absurd.

Aside from that...loved it. Even if I didn't agree with Atwell's character being present she still played well with others. Vanessa Kirby is always a delight to see. Gabriel's ghosty past didn't bother me as much as it did others.  

I'll definitely watch it again.",2023-07-15 23:38:19
"I just saw it with my dad. It was a very fun movie. I appreciated the call backs and it definitely had a different vibe than Fallout. However, maybe I missed something, but I can't stop thinking about when Grace uses Alanna's mask, her eye color shows through (Grace's color is brown, Alanna's is blue) yet no one who interacts with her seems to notice or comment on it.",2023-07-16 01:04:00
"Love the MI franchise. Enjoyed the movie, but have some criticisms‚Ä¶Ilsa dying is a big NO. She was the best part of MI besides Ethan. Never whining, never helpless, never making stupid decisions‚Ä¶now replaced by a thief?! No, just no. 

The forced backstory of Gabriel and Marie? Stupid. Cannot care about something that never happened but you are now telling me it happened just so we can introduce Gabriel and another brunette with brown eyes that Ethan liked/felt responsible for? Weak. 

Why the debate of Grace vs Ilsa? I thought Ethan and Ilsa had feelings for each other, but the ‚Äúwho to save‚Äù subplot makes no sense since Ethan barely knows Grace. Frustrating. 

Gabriel as a villain was bland. Esai was a much better villain in The Ozarks. 

Love seeing a face from the past in Kittridge! Had more LOL moments than most of the other MI‚Äôs. 

Still can‚Äôt wait for part 2!

"It was a cool detail for Grace to still have Hayley Atwell's brown eyes when she's posing as the Widow, instead of having Vanessa Kirby's blue eyes. Though this does raise the question of how the heck Zola missed his sister's eye color changing.",2023-07-17 08:55:43
"In the next few decades, either this movie gets terrifyingly prescient or laughably outdated. I'm inclined to say the latter. The AI threat is a fun concept to explore, and making it into a digital magic with a literal Saruman eye feels like something the early 2000s movies would do. It would be forgivable if the movie knew it was dumb, but I don't think it knows that. Time will not be kind to this movie.

This is the weakest M:I since 3. I'd go as far as to say 3 was a more ""fun"" breeze. The first act threw so much of expositions and location shifting without the elegant pacing, and the desert set piece just sucks. All the McGuffin-hunting and fetch quests bloat the plot while not much happening substantially. An efficient script doctor could have slotted the events in the desert to the airport and the events in Venice to Rome.

As a whole, there are many stuff that didn't work. It is too long for no reason, and I felt the runtime by the end. I don't think any other M:I except for 2 had this much of a focus in the gunfights. Or just fights, really. Also a heavier dose of CGI that looked fake. It is impressive Cruise did make that jump, but the movie ruins it by painting the CGI cliff. The confrontation after the party with Elsa and the henchman using swords rather than guns as if it is Star Wars lacks the creative spark the other M:I films had. Compare it to the action scenes in the similar settings from Rogue Nation. The action scenes in the other McQuarrie films had more raw and ingenious energy, and nothing in this movie matches the nail-biting set pieces from Fallout.

The AI henchman concept is especially dumb. I assumed the twist is that he is overseeing the AI algorithm to calculate the plans and infiltrate the international networks like Die Hard 4 or Skyfall, and that would make more sense, but nope. It's not just Skynet, it's Skynet from Genisys.

Ghost Protocol's villain was dumb, too, but that was fine because he served the purpose and fit the tone. Making this henchman character some sort of arch nemesis of Ethan and a tragic backstory reeks a desperation of the filmmakers' part of making stuff deep and serious by ""this time it's personal"" don't help it at all. 

Haley Atwell is a highlight. The movie is redoing that thief character from 2 but magnitudes better. The Italy car chase is what Specter's car chase should have been, and that train scene is what the Uncharted movie should have been. Just showcases how M:I has replaced Bond as a superspy blockbuster that inspires and instills ""woah"" in this generation.",2023-07-19 03:24:51
"going against the grain here, but I found this very flat.

The plot is ridiculous, and not in a ""well this is fun, go with it"" manner, its just absolutely hilariously absurdly awful.

Some of the stunts are just jarring, that motor cycle jump was supposed to be impressive, it was not, and the way the bike was clearly running along a flat ramp, but the ground it was shown on was rugged so they did not match was awful.

And a couple of moments really took me out of the film. the ""swapping seats thing"" and the ""crash through train on parachute in just the right place"" were just so bad it was cringe inducing.

And quite a few times, they just lazily cut, and dont show you how stuff was resolved, its off camera. did they run out of ideas? did a writer leave and they just gave up filling the blanks? Who knows.

And I cant remember when I last saw fight choreography so bad in a big budget film like this. I actively laughed out loud at how comically bad that bridge fight scene was.

was it awful? no. Was it enjoyable? mostly. Was it a great film or even a good MI film? no, not really.",2023-07-19 11:49:17
Rebecca Ferguson and Hayley are two of the sexiest women alive,2023-07-19 20:52:13
I am pretty sure POM would be back in Part 2. There's a reason why it was purposely scened saying that she's still alive.,2023-07-20 21:13:56
"Really did not like this one, they went full Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt narcissism for the character development and the exposition scenes were longer and duller than usual. They also seemed to completely abandon anything interesting about the nature of the antagonist halfway through the film as well.

Especially after the last film made such a big deal about involving Simon Pegg's character more in the actions scenes, his character was totally sidelined, as was Rebecca Ferguson's awesome character. Then, the implication that Cruise's character was now involved with both Vanessa Kirby and Haley Atwell? Yuck.

A few action set pieces make the film worth watching, however, like usual in a Mission Impossoble. The Rome car chase, Abu Daubi airport scene and train escape were all excellent but boy were there some interminable narrative dumps and tedious everyone talking about Ethan Hunt things in between those moments. In short, they expanded everything bad about this series (Tom Cruise not in action scenes) and reduced everything good (supporting characters, great action scenes). Too bad, after the last one was so good.",2023-07-24 01:14:12

"I'll be honest aside from the part where he bikes off the cliff, it was mid.",2023-07-16 04:14:58
"It was okay. If it sets up a perfect finale I'll be happy with it, but I'm worried that together these two movies are going to be a dud. There's obviously a lot to like, so I'll just the few things I disliked and that have me worried. 

1. The dialogue sucked. It was cliche and empty

2. The fight sequences on the bridge were stupid, and that whole scene felt over hyped and underwhelming at the same time. You're telling me that grace has a secret second knife, and instead of stabbing him unaware she holds the knife up and opens it in front of his face to let him know that she has it? And then a character with a sword fights in extremely close quarters with a guy who has a tiny knife and loses because of it? Not a fan of that scene and the unnecessary death that we knew was coming and felt completely avoidable

3. There's a lot of cg in this movie that I don't think works. The train tunnel sequence looks just as bad as the one from Indiana Jones 5. The lighting looks bad, it's sloppy, and it just doesn't look good. The cliff he rides his bike off of looks wrong, it's clearly cg and makes the whole sequence looks fake, which is a shame and defeats the purpose of doing the stunt for real. I also understand why they made a big deal out of the stunt for marketing, but that also took all the energy or drama out of the scene. The way Dunn guides him up there and avoids telling him it's a cliff jump is cheesy, unrealistic, and extremely cliche, so that goes back to point number 1

4. The fact that they manage to swindle the key makes the film end on the most lackluster cliff hanger. I think dread is the cliff hanger they should have aimed for, with the bad guy keeping the key and setting something in motion that puts the characters in real danger, kind of like the end of John wick 3. Give us reason to come back. 

5. The villain and the entity don't feel that threatening. It just feels off. The AI feels like it's not that powerful, and the bad guy just kind of walks around and looks threatening which is lame. Maybe this was so they had somewhere to go for the next movie, but if not then it's simply bad. If the characters were going to end on a high note with the key then it should have been a focus and should have been orchestrated better rather than just being a cheesy off screen bait and switch. This movie did this successfully earlier on, but it failed in the final act, and it felt too easy, and also deflated the suspense they were building towards. 



4. The bomb defusing riddle sequence was stupid. Enough said

The next movie needs a great heist scene, it needs a massive stunt, and it needs to use the threat of the AI to give a reason for the IM team to use classic gadgets like an old spy film, like real fuses, gadget watches, trick pens, things like that. It's a huge opportunity to ground the film and avoid the pitfall of movies these days that uses tech to cover over logical problems, kind of like the sonic screwdriver in Dr who. If the 2nd film doesn't knock our socks off it will reveal just how bad this one is. If it's amazing, then this movie will serve as a decent setup. I'm not convinced it's going to happen. I was really really pumped for this after how good top gun Maverick and MI 6 were, but now I'm not so sure.",2023-07-17 16:15:55
"I dont know about this one...I have watched all MI movies in the first week on the big screen...This one didn't hit the same way.

Going in, I was a little worried because I am not a fan of diving the movies into parts - This felt stale and the stunts felt like an after thought. The whole time Tom was chasing a key...It was a lot and very little at the same time - saving up for part 2.

It wasn't as tight-knit as fallout and fell short in every way. It hurts but a solid 7/10 IMO.

I was annoyed by the car chase...yeah ok BMW pays you but it felt like...ok we did this in rogue nation...lets throw him in a fiat now.",2023-07-19 21:12:18

"This was the first Mission Impossible movie I got to see in theaters on the big screen and I had a BLAST. There was this old lady sitting next to me and she basically reacted in the same way I did during certain scenes except in a much louder and expressive manner haha.

Other thoughts:

* Some dialogue-heavy scenes seemed to drag a bit for me, to be honest. I think the cinematography during those scenes didn't help either because it was a lot of close-ups and just cutting to whoever was talking.
* VANESSA KIRBY OMG.
* Probably my favorite car chase scene in the franchise! Everything after they got into that little Fiat had me grinning like an idiot.
* It's 2023 and I had a feeling AI would be an element here, but I like that the villains are wanting to utilize it instead of having AI be the bad guy (like Age of Ultron).
* I think this movie suffers from the same thing that happened with John Wick 4, where there's just too many characters chasing the protagonist, and it's hard for me to care about all of them. I loved Paris but I wish we got to know a bit more about her (like why she was teamed up with someone like Gabriel) before she died.
* Also I'm genuinely upset that Ilsa got killed off like that. They did a fake out at the beginning of the movie only to actually killer her later, and I was like...really?? I loved the buildup of her during Rogue and Fallout so to see her get killed off like that hurt.
* That train sequence was INSANE and had me on the edge of my seat.
* I like that Grace was an example of what kind of people end up choosing to be in the IMF. It'll be interesting to see a glimpse of Ethan's pre-IMF life in part two.
* Simon Pegg is always a win. I need more Benji.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with it and I can't wait to see part two. It's been a while since we've had MI in an underwater setting so I'm excited to see that.",2023-07-12 03:37:20

"- car chase scene is too long
- Paris's facial expressions annoyed me lol, her character feels like an unnecessary addition to the film, I hope she's given more lines and a bit of personality
- Gabriel is too overpowered, he gets to work with the entity AND fights
- I watched it with my boyfriend and we both said that the opening scene of the submarine is the most interesting and exciting part of this film. But we both had fun watching it so it's a 9 from me.",2023-07-12 03:46:45
"Enough with the two-part movies but especially enough with the ‚Äúwe need to find two parts of this thing‚Äù movies.

Loved Pom Klementieff. Bored by Esai Morales.

The women of MI have incredible facial structure (better structure than the plot here‚Äîsecond act is a mess).

The third-act is an all-timer.

I was thrilled. I was frustrated. I‚Äôll be back next year.",2023-07-12 04:09:21

"Definitely felt the length. I expected the movie to end after Ilsa's death and setup the train heist as Part 2's intro. When it became clear that was going to be part of the movie, I expected it to be a lot more concise.

The action and acting are great, but the plot didn't completely work for me. A menacing AI is a little too cheesy and Gabriel really wasn't that well developed. Having multiple parties all chasing each other is fun, but I think I'd prefer if Gabriel himself was the big baddy rather than subservient to a computer. The AI super virus should have just been the McGuffin instead of a scary blue antagonist.",2023-07-12 04:19:09
"The good: A+ production quality. Eyepatch sniper Ilsa. Kittridge. AI villain concept. Real stunts. Felt like a proper spy film.

The not-so-good: Killing Ilsa in lame fashion. Flabby pacing with scenes running too long. Underuse of returning characters (Ilsa, Benji, Luther, Alana) in favor of a boring new character (Grace). No ""holy shit"" moments like the Burj Khalifa climb, opera scene, HALO jump, helicopter chase (just my opinion, I don't think the train or the handcuff car chase were nearly as good).",2023-07-12 04:24:30
"I don‚Äôt like how they portrayed Gabriels relationship with the entity through just a wrist watch. 

That‚Äôs not very helpful as an audience member only see that part, because it has to have other ways of talking to him. Steal the idea they had in Westwood and have an earpiece but not a watch",2023-07-12 04:36:09

"I LOVED Hayley Atwell‚Äôs character in this. 

Also that train sequence at the end was just glorious",2023-07-12 04:45:57
"So, maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, but my biggest takeaway was that the entity set most of this in motion specifically to draw out, and neutralize Ethan Hunt, because it viewed him as it‚Äôs biggest threat. Ethan Hunt even puts the fear of god into what is essentially a savvy Skynet. That‚Äôs fucking badass. On a related note, why give the damn thing a name that no one ever uses? I also could‚Äôve done without the weird digital blob that made weird robot noises.

I hated Grace, because basically everything she did felt unearned, like why do I give a shit about this character? Especially when she replaces an amazing character like Elsa. However, on further examination, it seems pretty obvious that they faked Elsa‚Äôs death. Gabriel made it clear one had to die, so they made it look that way, with the entity‚Äôs right hand man witnessing her ‚Äúdeath‚Äù first hand. They even told us Luther was going into hiding, so it‚Äôs clearly the strategy.

Too much comedy, but whatever. 

For real though, the most powerful being on the planet fears Ethan fucking Hunt.",2023-07-12 04:51:52
"I felt like it was an entire movie. Sure, the Big Bad is still out there, but it‚Äôs like the end of Star Wars, where the Empire hasn‚Äôt been defeated and Darth Vader is still floating out there somewhere, but the heroes achieved their objective, which was to get the key back, in this case.",2023-07-12 04:57:14

‚ÄúI promise you to put your life before mine.‚Äù

At the end of the day, Ethan has a Superman complex dialed to 100.",2023-07-12 05:12:10
"Thought it was pretty underwhelming. The script felt weird with them explaining what's happening in the movie as I'm watching it. I didn't like the sentient AI route and needing the source code to kill it doesn't really make sense. 

The train, car, and stunt scenes did not disappoint, but a lot of the hand to hand fight scenes choreography felt off and not real. Rebecca dying the way she did was a bit lame.The Fiat scene was hilarious.

I was curious about Pom because her voice isn't the stereotypical villain voice and they basically didn't let her talk. Hayley looked absolutely stunning and loved both of their performances.

I don't remember the previous MI films all that well, but this one seemed to be obsessed with showing the realistic face masks more than usual. All in all it was still entertaining and the trend of part 1 movies this year continues.",2023-07-12 05:17:27
"8/10. car chase was excellent. the train jump, and the lead up with grace and kittrigde was great. i didn't like the train car dominions. too over the top. one car climb was fine, but 3/4? too much. the fight on top of the train with gabriel was too close to the original mission impossible, which was done better with the Chunnel and chopper. i really like kittridge. he brings it. grace was great. the story is not very convoluted, but the exposition makes you think it is. show dont tell. 

the ai taking over benjis voice is a great use of show, dont tell. more example like that could have cut done the exposition, and streamlined the story.

cruise was cruise, he brings it. him and grace have good chemistry, especially during the chase scenes.",2023-07-12 05:24:30
"I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but I wasn‚Äôt as on the edge of my seat as I was hoping I would be. 
Some parts in the middle kind of dragged for me. I still think the Burj Khalifa sequence in Ghost Protocol, while simpler than the motorcycle parachute jump, remains the series‚Äô best and most tense stunt. I think the train sequence was fun, but it was hyped up a little too much. I did like the Abu Dhabi airport and the Rome car chase scenes, though. 

Also, the villain was a bit weak. A few grainy black and white scenes wasn‚Äôt enough to establish what Gabriel meant to Ethan, and I‚Äôm hoping they really flesh out this part of the story in the sequel. Furthermore, the opening scenes before the theme song and title card didn‚Äôt have the same punch as previous movies did, and I kind of miss the spy elements of earlier entries, whereas recent entries have been way more action heavy. 

All in all, a solid 8/10 for me, although I‚Äôm not as hyped for the next installment as I thought I would be. Certainly not an Infinity War or Spider-Verse cliffhanger that made me want to watch the next movie as soon as possible.",2023-07-12 05:34:01

There's a few things I could nitpick (a few too many Hayley-Atwell-looks-surprised-at-the-camera-in-a-swerving-car shots; a couple moments of clunky fight choreography; this kind of movie not really handling the tension of character death very well), but none of them blemish the experience enough to really be a substantial complaint.

No shade on Pom as she did a great job with what she got, but in the somewhat grounded world of MI she stuck out like a sore thumb to me and ultimately felt a bit unnecessary, even with her saving Ethan and Grace (with itself was a bit lame, especially with the ‚Äòwhy didn‚Äôt you kill me?‚Äô final words).",2023-07-12 08:14:44
"I want to add this to the thread. 

Who would have known - Tom Cruise will definitely go down in history as a significant post-pandemic cinematic figure. 

Tom Cruise delivered a smash hit with *Top Gun: Maverick* last year. The box office projections for this movie is pointing to a big hit. The only threat this movie has is that Oppenheimer is projected to be a big Imax hit (which will eat up this movie's Imax showing). 

Let me be clear, I'm not saying that we, as an audience, have shown that we heavily favor Tom Cruise as a major star. We all have our reservations about him given his background with scientology. However, he was the main creative force behind making *Top Gun: Maverick* and *Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I* a fine craftsmanship of cinema. They are not superhero movies. They are not franchise movie that heavily focuses on shallow movie stars with bloated CGI. These two movies has proven that we are hungry for good storytelling and good cinematic experience. 

And we have the Part II coming out next year. 

Tom Cruise is not what the audience is clamoring for. But his philosophy of filmmaking is what catching the studios' attention right now. It helps that a good amount of shallow CGI-bloated movies are failing this summer. Hell, Harrison Ford is an universally liked actor and he couldn't save *Indiana Jones 5* because the audience doesn't want a mediocre movie saddled with uninspired CGI. 

And I hope this will stick. I hope the studios will take notes with *Maverick* and this movie and try investing in quality storytelling and quality filmmaking. This has proven to have a strong audience draw. 

If anything, this movie gives me a hope for a future at the cinemas.",2023-07-12 08:19:21
"Really like the movie but find grace character pretty annoying. And why is Tom cruise and crew all the sudden go heads over heels for some random thief who they know little about or even if she's a good person?

however....the entity was like a poorly done AI villain from a 90's action film with limited budget

the fiat 500 scene was not funny at all",2023-07-12 08:49:34
I enjoyed Mission Impossible:Waifu Wars,2023-07-12 09:25:56
"It has Hayley Atwell, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson, of course it's good.  
  
Ok, great action movie, even as a designated part one it feels pretty self contained and delivers another memorable action classic. I wouldn't say the action reaches the dizzying highs of the Burj Khalifa scene in Ghost Protocol or Rogue Nation's plane catch or most of Fallout, but it comes pretty damn close in like 3 different scenes. Plus a satisfying story, characters, so well paced and so much straight spy fun. Can't wait for part two and give me as many as Tom can make.

seriously though, how is Hayley Atwell not at the very least toplining Netflix romantic comedies?",2023-07-12 09:57:17
"Just got back. Soooo many thoughts lol but I loved the movie overall. I want to read what others think but it's crazy these movies gets bigger and deeper with every one. Ethan seemed really lost here in ways he hasn't in the other movies. But a lot going on and crazy action. Yeah I have to get my thoughts together but I have been watching this franchise since 1996 and it's only let me down once (and we don't have to say which one ;)). 

I think this will be the movie to beat this summer.",2023-07-12 10:03:39
"Overall, I liked the movie. I rewatched the franchise before seeing the latest installment, and I think it‚Äôs on line with the latter half of the franchise, though I don‚Äôt think Dead Reckoning part I is better than for example Fallout or Rogue Nation.

  
I really enjoyed the callbacks to the first movie. Venice was great, Kitteridge was great, and the train sequence with Max‚Äôs daughter also felt like an homage. This was by far the funniest MI movie as well; especially the Rome sequence had my theater laughing aloud.  
I do think there were more of my movie pet peeves in this one. All the scenes devoted to plot had really underwhelming dialog; the use of the words ‚Äúthe Entity‚Äù and ‚Äúthe key‚Äù was far too liberal, to the point the repetition made it really nonsensical when the characters were speaking.

  
I don‚Äôt think MI is really known for providing the best movie villains out there (safe for maybe Philip Seymour Hoffman‚Äôs role in MI III), so I think the idea of an AI one is interesting ‚Äì but I wasn‚Äôt entirely sold on Gabriel as its envoy. 

  
This brings me to another pet peeve: when the new villain has a previously unestablished connection to the main hero outside the established franchise for pretty much no reason. I see that it‚Äôs meant to provide motivation but it‚Äôs a pretty cheap way of establishing tension between Gabriel and Ethan in my view. As was it wholly unnecessary for the plot. Ethan doesn‚Äôt need a personal connection to the villain to be the hero, and after Ilsa dies he has all the personal motivation he needs anyway ‚Äì why this vague and almost insulting ‚Äúit was he who created Ethan‚Äù storyline? It‚Äôs a no for me on that.

  
It‚Äôs the same with the sudden lore dump that IMF agents are former criminals who accepted service instead. It just doesn‚Äôt work for me. Luther I can buy as a former criminal (mostly because we know he was one), but Ethan only works because he was magically framed for a crime in the past. Benji was a field technician before being an agent, and Ethan‚Äôs new recruit who dies in the beginning of MI III seemed clean as a whistle. All just unnecessary setup for Grace becoming an agent when they could have just recruited her at the end anyway.  
Grace was fun but it does seem a little like there‚Äôs only room for one pretty brunette (Tom certainly has a type), and the passing of the baton is getting kinda old. In Fallout, we had Julia to come back to rubber stamp the Ilsa-Ethan relationship, and then the killing off of Ilsa seemed like a decision to make room for Grace.

  
As for the action in this one, I think it‚Äôs a step-down from Fallout. The driving off the cliff was nice, but the getting there was so drawn-out and hardly the pace we‚Äôve gotten used to in the past movies. I kept thinking of Henry Cavill‚Äôs line in MI VI: ‚ÄúEnough talk, I‚Äôll see you in Paris.‚Äù Some of the race sequences in Rome also seemed less crisp than previous installments.   
I still think the MI franchise is at the top of action movies and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next one.",2023-07-12 10:22:52
"A solid entertainer with Cruise still giving it all, a couple of grand set pieces, humor and a new addition in Hayley Atwell. Looks like they traded Ilsa for Grace. Surely they are not going to fake Ilsa's death twice in the same movie, right?  Hope we get some more development for Gabriel and the Entity in the sequel.

"A new mission with higher stakes with bigger stunts, and heartbreak.

- AI as the villain is a super interesting choice. AI's presence is felt throughout the movie. It reminded me of the TV series Person of Interest.
- 1st act was off, pacing wise, maybe due to the opening being about 20mins before the title sequence
- 2nd act to end was at breakneck pace, the car chase in Rome is probably the best set-piece of the movie
- Some of the scenes were extremely funny due to the insane stakes
- Ilsa dying was hard as she was Ethan's equal in every way but saw it coming after she got 4th billing in the title credits 
- Cruise's to Grace saying ""your life will always mean more to me than mine"" was great acting 
- Hayley Atwell fit very well with Cruise 
- Luther and Benji didn't have much to do
- Gabriel with the ""Ethaaaan"" scream was perfect!
- I love that AI permutations and probabilities of Paris betraying the AI created a self-fulfilling prophecy and drove her to save Ethan
- Directing was great. The movie had the feels of the 1st Mission Impossible movie with the flashbacks, Venice scenes, and the train climax

"Weakest MI since MI:2. The AI does absolutely nothing for me, it's just a screen with menacing music, it's just predicting things and things fall into place like it says. Especially when it's spelled out for us in Part 1 of a 2 part movie. Kinda predictable it'll happen to set up for the second part.

The physical enemy we do get, Gabriel, feels like he has zero agency because he's just following a script that we've all been told. His actions aren't his own and it's just so blah. Compare this to MI:3 where the entire prescence and threat of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character is what makes it. 

There were also an obnoxious amount of close up shots constantly cutting back and forth, even in the relaxed scenes. For a film about teamwork and unity they really don't want to show it through the camerawork.

All that said, I was entertained and the long running-time quickly passed. The film opened strong with the submarine scene.",2023-07-12 11:43:55

But I understand why they did it - McQuarrie and Cruise are just showing off with their action set pieces at this point. While I thought Gabriel was a bit of a disappointing villain (surely he gets more time in Part Two) and I felt the third act also was a little confusing in terms of tracking each character's motivations, I still really enjoyed my time in the theater with this.

If they had done the ""incompetent idiot"" trope, where Tom Cruise is always having to hold her hand and pull her places and she's messing things up for him, then I don't care about her at all. They were smart not to go that route.

Spectacular. Reminded me of the Uncharted games. It's just a shame that the music was so mindless and repetitive. I like Lorne Balfe but he needs dropping from this franchise. He's the only composer to score multiple films despite doing the worst job of anyone.",2023-07-12 19:17:34

Considering Fallout might be the best in the series, it was always going to be tough to live up to that. But I can‚Äôt wait for part two. When Mission: Impossible releases it feels like a holiday to me.

Also, this one gave me the most laughs of any of the movies in the franchise. I love that even though they‚Äôre seven films deep, they still lean into the campiness and the fun aspects. I had fun",2023-07-12 20:45:15

I really enjoyed the villain in this. Never knowing what was real and what wasn‚Äôt gave me that sense of paranoia that has been missing in the last few MI films. Not to say this is better than Fallout but those thriller aspects along with some very funny sequences made this a very different film for me that I greatly enjoyed. I think I will enjoy this more and more upon rewatch.,2023-07-12 23:52:07

Its not as great as Fallout, but very few action flicks are. While i understand what they were going for, but i still felt the action scenes could have been better or more interesting.

Soundtrack also felt a bit disappointing after all the hype. It felt it was just copy pasted from the previous entry. Which Fallout is a fantastic score in its own right, but i would prefer an evolution of some kind.

But most importantly, how does it reflect on Hollywood that fuckin Mission Impossible has better comedic scenes than 99,9% comedies of the last decade or so?",2023-07-13 00:59:45

"Aside from all that's already been said, what I loved the most was the almost mystical portrayal of what the IMF is, how if functions, how it does not follow orders, does the impossible, and how its agents, who become like ghosts, have to take a vow, like becoming a knight, and how importance the film put around the ""decision"".

""*We live and die for the ones we love and the ones we'll never meet*"" or something, it felt so heroic and otherworldy, like as if they were angels or something.

The first six movies never really bothered to build around the IMF, they all did their own thing each, with their actors and locations, but it just felt like any other secret service, and Ethan just going rogue all the time, but this time, it felt different, it didn't feel like a secret service, and Ethan didn't feel like an agent, it felt all much more superior, just like the threat they're up against now.",2023-07-13 02:05:10

"A bunch of different things bugged me about this movie, but the #1 thing was the plot. 

They essentially retconned how everyone gets into MI6 (or if it's from the earlier TV show, this is the first time it's been brought up in the series) and use it as a way to shoehorn in a new character/love interest. This also seems to closely mirror the main plot of the movie Eagle Eye with Shia LaBeouf. I was actually looking forward to the love interest story of Ethan and Ilsa FINALLY getting to be together, but then they rip it apart.   


The villain of the film also reminded me too much of Cesar Millan in a lot of the scenes, which took me out of it.  Kittridge returning was fun, but a bit annoying - seemed to be played way too over the top. I actually preferred Indiana Jones DOD to this movie.",2023-07-13 03:31:14

Do any of you guys ever seen the kissing cut scene in mi6 between Ethan and Ilsa? So sad they killed her off like that easily. Replaced by a new girl he barely knows.

The train sequence was enjoyable but what bothered me was trying to figure out which part was practical and which was green screen/CGI. Usually they make it pretty clear in this franchise which is what makes these films great. Obviously they didn't actually jump from train to train? Them fighting on top of running train? Was the bridge exploding and train crashing real? It all looked a bit fake to me but I remember reading about the filming for this.,2023-07-13 06:25:08

"Chris Stuckmann can say that Fallout is the best entry of the franchise and I agree from an action thriller standpoint, but Dead Reckoning Part 1 just merged science fiction thriller and spy thriller genres together, which is a huge thing to do. The fact that Ethan Hunt is against the biggest enemy he's known, an enemy with no body, no remorse, no love, and no qualms about plunging the world into chaos, is one of the best stories written in both genres. 

I did feel shocked and saddened for Ilsa's death, but she knew she was going to die, and if her sacrifice meant stopping something like the Entity, she was willing to take the risks, and you could see that during the meeting scene in Mitsopolis' party.",2023-07-13 10:32:30

"Saw it in IMAX last night. Wasn‚Äôt nearly as engaged as I was for Fallout. I get that‚Äôs a tough film to follow, but I found this one to be the least thrilling. Cruise, for the first time in a while, seems to be in, well Cruise-control. Noticed too many similarities to John Wick 4. The Rome roundabout, people rolling down stairs, knife through hand, euro nightclub brawls. I dunno, also seemed much sillier than previous instalments. How no one noticed Grace‚Äôs brown eyes while being The White Widow I‚Äôll never understand. The sounds associated with the ‚Äúmenacing‚Äù Entity were pretty hilarious as well. This thing could interfere with any digital device ‚Äî the masks, guiding Ethan ‚Äî yet allowed Simon Pegg to drive his car from the passenger seat. I did enjoy the falling train cab sequence, reminded me of The Lost World. I‚Äôll be back in theatres for Part 2, but with much less anticipation.",2023-07-13 12:30:34
"The film was pretty intense, but this felt like I was only waiting for the next action setpiece more than any other M:I. 

I enjoyed the rogue AI concept and the stakes felt high. But because this is Part One, all the story and character development is being saved for Part Two. More than any other M:I movie, the story felt secondary to the action because of this. We learned almost zero backstory for Gabriel, Grace, Ethan‚Äôs new past, etc. I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to fill it all in in Part One, but this is the danger of splitting the story into two films. It left me a little cold towards the story connecting the setpieces.

Still, incredible set pieces as usual. Tom Cruise is insane and everyone saying the bike jump wasn‚Äôt thrilling needs to get their dopamine centers checked.

But after Part 2 comes out, it will be weird watching just Part 1 in the future.",2023-07-13 12:48:21

I like how Ethan always says ""I'll figure it out.""  Most plans and overall executions go by on a whim.  They Just happen.   And Ethan's character revolves around that.  

Third act doesn't pack the same punch as Fallout but still super effective 

Running scenes are excellent as always.",2023-07-14 04:15:03

overall really liked it but I think most of the Venice segment could be removed. I just didn't like Gabriel, and the whole chase/bridge fight wasnt great. something about it just seemed too clean?. They were perfectly centered on the top of this bridge and kept fighting there, seemed like a fighting video game stage.",2023-07-14 11:37:44
"This movie really had the perfect amount of comedic relief for an action heavy drama. At no points was did they use it enough that it was expected nor was it used so little it was jarring. A lot of action movies, especially ones with a serious overtone, could take notes.

My favorite scene was tom coming through the side of the train because that part was screaming ""ok how is tom going to save the day here?"" Then he just explodes through the window, I was dying laughing. Obviously the car flipping places bit was great too.",2023-07-14 14:44:23
"So where did The Entity come from? I got a little lost during the whole Cary Elwes exposition dump with Gabriel on the train.

"I know I probably shouldn't think about it that much but can anyone help me confirm what's going on with the Sevastapol, the key and the entity?

So from what I picked up in the movie: the US Government creates an AI that can penetrate systems and then terminate itself, leaving no evidence, ""the perfect intelligence operative"".  The AI (or a version of the AI) penetrates the Saudi Arabian intelligence and bolts on an adaptive learning algorithm and then gains the ability to change it's code and becomes ""The Entity"".  Another version of the AI is used to penetrate the Sevastapol in order to compromise it's stealth capabilities. This AI (which is unrelated to the Entity, I think? or is it?) goes ""rogue"" and causes the destruction of the Sevestapol, leaving it a wreck at the bottom of the Bering Sea.  

&#x200B;

We know that the Key is used to unlock the central core of the Sevestapol.  The CIA Director says that the key will allow them to use the original source code to bring the Entity to heel.  What I don't understand is if this Sevestapol AI is the original source code, then why did it go ""rogue""?  Are there really multiple versions of the AI/Entity, or is the one that compromised the Sevastopol actually the Entity?",2023-07-14 17:29:50

"Overall I liked this movie and I'm looking forward to part 2, but my biggest issue is that I never felt like the stakes were really as high as everyone was saying they were. I mean, I understand that a sentient AI with access to any and all technology it wants and the ability to actively influence said technology isn't a good thing, but given that most of the dirty work was carried out by Gabriel, it never really felt to me like The Entity was a big bad on the same level as Solomon Lane. We got hints of what it could do when it hacked Ethan's coms and pretended to be Benji to send him on a wild goose chase to prevent him from saving Ilsa, but that was the only time we saw it acting on its own. 

It didn't help that we never got a backstory for Gabriel and why he's so devoted to The Entity, or even why it chose him in the first place, but I assume that's coming in part 2, and I'm hoping we'll get a better sense of The Entity as an active threat.

But it was definitely a net positive. Not quite as good as Fallout or Rogue Nation, but on par with Ghost Protocol. Loved Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff in this one and hope that they'll get a couple of scenes together in the next one.",2023-07-15 13:54:55

"I was thoroughly entertained by this film. The stunts were incredible - the standout being the bike ride right off a massive five hundred foot cliff. The production values were about the highest in a film I've seen this year, so that's definitely another plus. 

However Ethan Hunt is invincible/unkillable so one knows there's actually no stakes involved; he'll never die, just the women around him will. Plus an AI program that can take control of virtually all world governments and systems?! Even for a Mission Impossible film that's quite a stretch. 

**Overall** ***Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I*** **(2023) rating: 8/10, amazing stunts and huge production values - definitely worth a watch in theaters.

"Have to write up another post.

1. The action was insane. Loved it. The story was quite good too. Loved the overall pacing of the movie and that it started with ... like, 2 bangs. First the submarine opener and then the security briefing. Pretty awesome. :D

1. The bit with the security meeting was pretty cool. Kittridge (the actor is 3 years older than Tom Cruise, btw) again was cool, he got that role down, i.e. being a bit vague about events and dangerous. And the big intelligence meeting was awesome/interesting. But... as it turns out, the movie didn't shy away from the trope of the ""stupid ass shit boss dude reveals ALL the information to the opponent"". Did not expect Director of National Intelligence to do that goofy shit, pretty weird.

1. I did not appreciate Ilsa's death to add another layer on top of Ethan desperation. It was cool to bring her back for the mission and have them experience a ...  moment of suppressed ~~horni~~ smiles on the rooftop in venice and share something. I mean, they obviously had a spark but it wasn't necessary to kill her off. I mean, in all seriousness (even within movie logic), the AI angle and power play of all the big nations for the entity, cryptostuff and the next best guy's true or fake opinion of events was a million times more scary and enough of a pressure cooker. And to add that layer of projected rage for Gabriel... meh. The dude was weird and even with movie magic in the mix, fighting him when like a billion bullets would have done, was just... ok then. All that bridge fighting against Gabriel was too eyeroll-inducing. And then... there was another fight on the train! Ok then. Aaaand he jumped off the train. Oh he doesn't have the gizmo. Ah fuck he is going to be in the next one. I hardly believe that Rebecca Ferguson wanted to leave the franchise. She was a good fit (for the team, although her character's life was quite tragic imgo) and seeing how >!she got out, Mechanical and the Sheriff department won't need her as much anymore<. So that would have been a bummer if it had made sense but the way they set it up was a bit edgy and, odd and trope-y imho.


1. Loved the 2 clandestine agents who followed Hunt over like all the continents in all the vehicles and trains and whatnot. Pretty funny. Seems like we have great new candidates for the IMF if they can run that much. Hehehe. :)",2023-07-17 09:00:33

"I feel like I was expecting something else - more spectacle and more set pieces, which is unfair because it's already loaded with many of these. I think I was expecting more (as if what this movie didn't have enough already), but it's my fault and not the movie's fault.

What I didn't like was how it feels that they disrespected Ilsa's character, who's been built for 2 movies only to be put aside as someone who has to die only for Grace to take her woman-close-to-Ethan role, I think that Ilsa deserved more.

Nevertheless, this was a great movie. I'd give it an 8/10",2023-07-18 05:01:08
"Terrific action flick. Loved all the characters, especially Grace, who makes an unenviable choice. This is the kind of high-octane thriller that Hollywood used to make but somehow decided it was cheaper to make lame teen slasher flicks.

"The Mission Impossible 1 easter eggs were quite great...

1: The key as a constant callback to the ""Red light green light""-explosive. Extra points for actually having the key halves flicker red and green when merged during the conversation with Kittridge. Lowkey expected a random aquarium to spontaneously combust.

2: The scene where Gabriel kills his first girlfriend is very reminiscent of how Krieger killed Sarah.

3: Great parallel with ""Alana"" bargaining with Kittridge to her mother Max bargaining with Kittridge

4: Train chase (even in a tunnel) obviously

5: Fakeouts with the ""true"" and fake halves of the key, callback to the fake and real NOC-lists (and the MI2 Chimera/Bellerophon fakeouts at the end)

Probably missed a couple others, but really enjoyed the callbacks to earlier MI movies :)",2023-07-18 22:10:10

"7/10 in terms of plot because it wasn't exactly anything new. 10/10 in terms of action and tension. Hard to see how any movie this year could possibly top this one in terms of action, the action sequences. For entertainment value alone, it's worth the watch, plus the plot is still passable in my opinion. We're so deep into this franchise and yet they still put out this quality, just insane.  
  
I did not realize that Pom was the actress who played Mantis... Wow, incredible talent and a standout in the film.",2023-07-19 13:50:57
"As my friend and I walked out of the theater, we realized that some parts reminded us of other media.

The almost mute henchman Paris - Ruby Rose's character in John Wick 2

The party inside an old castle in Venice with a lightshow - the party in Rome in John Wick 2

The fight in the desert at the beginning - the Uncharted games

The escape from the falling train cars - also Uncharted

It felt a bit too close to these examples to come off as original, although I liked Pom Clementieff's character. 

I had a lot of fun with the movie, the action is wonderful. But inbetween there's a lot of ""several people in a room taking turns explaining something one sentence each"". 

Also: What a long movie! I felt I needed a bathroom break but as the Venice chapter was nearing the end and they were planning the train mission, I thought this was the end. But nope, it went on. The train part was the highlight of the movie, but it just felt like it could've taken less time to get to that point.

My friend let out a massive sigh as they explained ""the AI"" and to be honest, it's kinda lame. I realize stuff like that fits the zeitgeist but it could've been a magic necklace for what they made it out to be. Also I didn't really understand why they had perfect 3D models of the keys, yet they had to have the original halves. Did I miss something? Just make a replica, it's a key.

Overall though, fun movie, as I expected. Looking forward to Part 7: Part 2.",2023-07-19 16:00:20
"So, in dead reckoning  ive been thinking about this a lot since i saw the movie and maybe itll be answered in part 2. The question is, how did the 2 parts of the key end up in other places?  after the submarine sinks we see those dead people float up to the surface below the ice and it shows 1 guy with the half key around his neck. so who found the 2 half keys? they had to have gone somewhere. then llsa just happens to come across a guy with a half key.",2023-07-20 00:01:11

Dude has got it BAD for the opposite sex anytime they make googly eyes at him. And really I can't blame him because every woman in this is a mega babe who kicks ass. Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson are Specifically people I now have a huge crush on. 

Maybe it's a byproduct of this being the only Mission Impossible movie that I've seen in theatre, and they were definitely meant to be seen that way, but this one is by and far my favourite. The story is gripping (though absolutely ridiculous and the dialogue is dreadful but funny), the action is ACTION PACKED. The stunts are great but there's only one stunt that is like super big that we all know by now but it didn't make the moment any less satisfying. The set up to it is the best yet.

I liked how topical it is too. I think years from now it'll be looked at from the perspective of where we were as a society now. This underlining fear and interest in AI that has kind of swept over our collective conciseness, it really taps into that. Albeit, in a fucking ridiculous way, but it's something that'll age really well or really poorly I think.It's kind of like our generations next frontier, and it really coincides well with this actor and writer strike that is happening alongside the release of this film. It's all very poetic and unintentionally so which makes seeing this movie now very important. The context of everything present today matters to best enjoy it. On top of all that I've learnt that these movies really aren't the same on a smaller screen in your living room. 

That being said, outside of some interesting wardrobe and character looks, the art direction and style is trash. The cinematography is bland (but the settings and action photography are good, just the look of it over all is bleh). I think McQuarrie's direction leaves a lot to be desired especially in any comedic situation, or dialogue heavy dramatic moment. But like I get why he does these films because he seems to be Cruises bitch boy which works for this haha. The supporting cast is really great and memorable for the most part but I found Hayley Atwell kind of unlikable, which is hard because she plays such a central role. I do think the villains however are some of the best since the third film. There seems to be a heavy John Wick influence here, similar to what happened when the Bourne movies were popular at the time as the third film cames out. 

I bought in. Was it worth watching every MI movie the last couple weeks just to see this? I'm not sure, I think you need to see them all to appreciate this one. I just wish it wasn't such a commitment. It does do a lot of interesting things and I think they've really taken this formula of Mission Impossible movies and perfected it here.",2023-07-21 03:27:49

"I wonder if I would have been more satisfied if the ""Grace"" character didn't fit into ""possible love interest"" spot? Especially so she didn't feel like an easy (disrespectful) trade for Ilsa? 

Like maybe if Grace was more obviously a young  daughter-figure instead (even though this 40yo woman could be Ethan's daughter).  I would have felt more emotional impact w Ilsa sacrificing herself if she wasn't just saving her own replacement. Could have been another chance at a protege character like Keri Russell's IMF newbie too, but scrappy this time. And Ethan being paternal again. I like Ethan being paternal!! He could have even been conflicted about suggesting she join IMF. Like, Luther suggests it, Ethan refuses cause it's dangerous and Grace refuses cause she doesn't trust anybody, but after seeing the team work together she chooses to accept because friends üò≠. 

I liked Grace as she is a lot, i just think Ethan doesn't need a beautiful love interest anymore. He's already done the marriage thing. He's done the trying again with his spy equal thing. I think ""friendship guardian"" Ethan hunt is basically asexual at this point anyway.",2023-07-23 20:16:30
"Cool little obvious visual foreshadowing. ""Ethan, this mission of yours is going to cost you dearly."" as that's said, Ilsa's photo is on a monitor right in the shot a bit blurred but clearly obvious. Basically saying yeah Ilsa is going to die.

"Kittridge and the mercenaries

Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 

Why did Kittridge set up the complicated backup plan, sending both Ethan and the mercenaries to retrieve the key from Ilsa? Granted Kittridge didn‚Äôt fully trust either Ethan or the mercenaries to give him the retrieved key. But If K didn‚Äôt trust the mercenaries to return the key why send them at all? Why should he introduce that complication if he was sending superstar Ethan to retrieve the key from Ilsa? If his purpose was to definitely kill Ilsa, he shouldn‚Äôt have assigned Ethan the case until after he killed her. And then send Ethan to retrieve the key as a backup. If his purpose was to retrieve the key using Ethan, whom he knew was close to Ilsa, then logically he should have worked with that simpler scenario. Essentially that‚Äôs the scenario that played out anyway‚Äîthe mercenaries were irrelevant. I suspect the director et. al. fudged that whole issue for two reasons: (a) they wanted that visually dramatic action scene in the desert where Ethan and Ilsa bond again and kill a lot of bad guys; and (b) they wanted to set up the poignant scenario where the AI tells Ethan that either Grace or Ilsa has to die. Ethan had to risk his life to save Ilsa, quickly and dramatically introducing Ilsa back into his life and into the movie plot , ) Funny how the damsel in distress meme still works, even when the damsels are extremely smart and competent.

"It is absolutely insane to me how at 60 years old Tom Cruise continues to get better as an actor and entertainer. After following up Top:Gun with the better Top Gun:Maverick, he follows up Fallout with the better Dead Reckoning. 

 Without a doubt the best Mission Impossible film. 

In awe at how great the action set pieces in this one were. Prior to the film they showed off the production of the Rome chase scene and seeing all of that being done with no CGI and proper stunts and sets was just mind blowing . 

Obviously ones like the train bombing were helped by CGI but I really appreciate seeing actual big action scenes unlike what we get with the big superhero stuff.

Story wise man easily the best written MI film. The stakes, tension, betrayals, all so damn good in this. I‚Äôd told myself to never trust anyone who gives Ethan orders in these movies but damn I found myself questioning and double guessing myself so much about who could be trusted in this. 

I hated to see Rebecca Ferguson go, but I appreciate that the writers are not afraid to kill off characters, giving weight to Gabriel and the entity as antagonists. He predicted that one would die that night in Venice and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. RIP Faust. 

The threat of the entity feels imposing throughout the film and is genuinely horrifying realising how dependent on electronics our society has become. If an AI infiltrated us like that, what could we do. 

Hayley Atwell is amazing as Grace. Loved she and Tom‚Äôs chemistry. I also really loved Pom Klementieff. I know she didn‚Äôt talk much but damn she was so badass throughout. I‚Äôm hoping she‚Äôs coming back in part 2, cause I‚Äôd love to see her back in action.

"Overall I have to say I'm disappointed, but it's not that it's bad, it just falls short of the heights of it's predecessors by a lot, and also recent action like John Wick 4 and Maverick

I wish the jump wasn't the focus of the trailers, it was basically the only big, raw action moment for me. The Rome chase was ok, but the pacing was so off that it never really had the momentum it needed imo. The only time I really felt like things were moving was the airport sequence and when they were working through the falling train cars (which had some questionable vfx at times that hurt the sequence)",2023-07-12 12:11:21
"Saw it last night, my thoughts:

**Pros:** 

\- Awesome intro. I though it did a good job setting the tone and intensity. 

\- Amazing set pieces, the airport was fun, Venice and the party were incredible, and that train sequence was just phenomenal. 

\- Dialogue (hear me out), the content of the dialogue at times was a little dense and even convoluted...but the pacing I found interesting. The Intelligence meeting was fun to watch even though it was a lot to take in. Same for the scene at the party, I really enjoyed the back and forth between all involved.

\- Characters: The ensemble is fantastic and each delivers in their own right. I'm very sad about Ilsa. I really thought her character brought huge presence to the franchise and the team. Shout outs to Kittridge, Widow, and Paris. I enjoyed every minute of their time on screen. 

\- Action sequences. They felt a little sparse throughout the film IMO but when they arrived I thought they were great. 

\- The desert sequence was a fun watch. 

  
\- Venice was great and I really enjoyed the bridge fight sequence, it was very tense. Also   
that alley way fight at first was off putting but I came to appreciate it at the end. 

  
\- The car chase was incredible and the back and forth between the comical sounds of   
the Fiat and the deep guttural growls of the police truck was incredible, what an   
experience in the theater. 

  
\- Shout out to the comic relief they laced through the car chase sequence as well, it was   
really well done IMO and the round-about scene had the theater erupting in laughter.

\- The train in the tunnel and bridge. During both those sequences I thought my wife was   
gonna break my hand.   


\- Story. I may not fully understand what's going on, but I got enough that I'm interested and want to know more.   


**Cons:**  


\- Story. As I mentioned above, I'm invested and want to know more. That said I feel like they could've clarified some things and not been so convoluted at times. They give us a lot of ""what"" and it feels like not enough ""why"". Now this could very well be part of Part 1/Part 2 nature of this film so I struggle to consider this a con. Still, I would have liked a little more up front.   


\- The villain. This sort of falls in with the above. I thought he was great overall, Esai really delivers a presence, he was intriguing, mysterious, intimidating. The problem I'm having is the film keeps making it out that he's this super dangerous individual, especially because of his association Ethan's past and with the entity...but ***why?***

Again, I'm sure (or hoping) that they'll deliver on this in part 2. I just wish we'd have gotten a little taste upfront. Leaving the theater my thought was that Solomon Lane might have been the better choice for this story? I just don't know.   


\- Grace. I enjoyed the character and I think Haley was a delightful presence on screen, especially during the car chase. But....the character motivations were really confusing. She's introduced as a thief chasing money which is simple enough and I'm on board with it. However, early on into the film its made very clear that she's exposed and also insanely over her head in this regard...so why does she keep engaging. This point is driven home several times throughout the movie and she continues to re-engage until finally the decision (or choice as the movie calls it) is forced upon her. I struggled with her decision not to take the exit several times before this point and thus her character joining the band felt a bit shoehorned.   


\- The cop duo: I love Shea Whigham and I'll watch him in damn near anything. But they felt really out of place and overall...useless? I just didn't see the point of them other than very basic plot devices.  


I'm sure more thoughts will crop up but that's enough for now. Overall I really enjoyed the film and thought it was another great entry into the franchise and as an action film. One thing that I feel will be necessary is to rewatch this movie right before seeing part two.",2023-07-12 16:25:54
"I might be hard coping since Ilsa is my favorite character, but I don't think she's dead. Her ""death"" was required in order to motivate Grace into helping the team. I think Ilsa is off working with Luther at the end of this film and will appear in the next film.",2023-07-12 18:33:34

"Just watched it in Dolby. Now THAT'S why I go to the theatres. I'll put it this way - Fast X had lots of crazy stunts and NO tension. This movie had lots of crazy stunts and I was on the edge of my seat for all of them. Also funny that both movies have an action scene in Rome and end with a submarine.

Also, Pom's character was badass. She might be up there with Gogo in Kill Bill and Gazelle in Kingsman for best female henchwomen.",2023-07-14 05:40:37
"Dissapointed. This was in no way on par with Fallout or Rogue Nation. Way too much expository dialogue, scenes that dragged a lot, and just felt incomplete. I would have loved if they just chopped everything a bit an made it a single movie. Hoping part 2 makes up for it",2023-07-14 06:33:17
"This movie has disappointed me with very few action scenes and a hour long bike ride/car chase scenes,i won't be watching the next ones in theatres but I support the use of not using CGI for everything.",2023-07-14 13:25:29

"I know people in this sub loved Fallout but I really am not the biggest fan of McQuarrie as a writer. He doesn't write MISSIONS, he write action sequences. Rogue Nation was already like this for the last 3rd but it's more obvious in Fallout and DR. Ethan Hunt doesn't plan missions, he just... goes and figures things out.

I really miss the missions like the Vatican in 3, Ghost Protocol had a lot (Kremlin, Dubai), Rogue Nation had the opera and the underwater heist.

Fallout? The Paris 'mission' but there as well, there is mostly no plan. Same for DR.

Those are good action movies but I maintain that Ghost Protocol was the best and what I would like to see more.",2023-07-15 05:20:44
"- Not my fave MI for sure, but I really enjoyed seeing Kittridge back (and all the gorgeous women of course, all my girl crushes in one film)
- I spent an unnecessarily long time trying to recall if Ethan‚Äôs pre-IMF flashbacks were in the first movie. 
- Loved the train sequence. A nice callback, great effects and everything. Reminded me too much of Anastasia (1997) though, which was funny tbh
- I had a bad feeling Ilsa would get replaced. Did it really have to happen? T_T I was optimistic, especially after how well they dealt with Julia‚Äôs character. Oh well. At least Hayley‚Äôs terrific as well.",2023-07-15 09:14:09
"A collection of great action scenes glued together by by some of the goofiest nonsense plot and exposition you‚Äôve ever seen. The limits of their improvisational production style is painfully obvious this time (especially after reading the submarine was a last minute addition). I‚Äôm sure covid affected things too, but this was rough. Characters float in and out of the plot, motivations are not well defined. Still a fun time at the theater, but as far as M:I movies go this is towards the bottom of the list.",2023-07-15 11:23:38
"Great action scenes, Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Atwell were *extremely* beautiful in this film, but the plot and storytelling was pretty corny IMO. I do like the *concept* they have going for a rogue, sentient AI, though.

Also, what is it with Hollywood films *still* having foreign people (namely, the Russians at the beginning in the submarine) speaking English to each other with an accent instead of their native tongue? Do they think audiences are too dumb to read subtitles?",2023-07-15 11:40:43

"It was an OK film, incredible action and a lot of good acting however the story isn't that appealing and Grace was genuinely incredibly annoying.

Every decision she made during the film made next to no sense and was just frustrating. Hunt saves her multiple times yet she keeps trying to escape him.
Ilsa was fantastic, shame she's dead though.",2023-07-15 22:08:09

"I had fun with this movie, but I still feel conflicted. The characters felt cartoony at times, and the pacing felt off for the entire film.

Rogue Nation and Fallout were amazing, but this one didn'thave the same vibe and that's sad. I hope they can figure it out in part 2.",2023-07-16 04:44:53

"Man I loved it. 

Definitely not as good as MI: Fallout (but I'd argue that is legitimately the best action movie of all time). 

Having Grace be bad at driving was hilarious. Of course a master thief also wouldn't immediately be great at all the ""spy stuff"". A lesser movie would have just had her character immediately have the stunt driving skills needed to get the cool action shots. Ilsa is still my favorite MI girl by far, but Atwell held her own in this one. 

Gabriel was pretty ""meh"" but his character did seem menacing, so props there. The entity is the real villain of Dead Reckoning and I think they did a great job showing just how dangerous it can be. It felt like Lane always being one step ahead of Ethan in Rogue One but on steroids.",2023-07-16 21:36:43
"I loved how light and fun it was for the most part, a nice change of pace from the sort of dour tone of Fallout (which I loved, don‚Äôt get wrong.) Probably the funniest M:I movie since Ghost Protocol. 

Great movie. All the stunts were of course incredible and a damn blast but I think my favorite sequence was the business at the airport. Probably the fastest 3 hour movie I‚Äôve seen. 

Will definitely have to see it again soon; right now my ranking is 5>4>7>6>1>3>2. Love all of them from 3 onward.",2023-07-16 23:32:41

"I wasn‚Äôt in good mood for the movie when I saw it and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcheck the brain at the entrance‚Äù as I should which is probably why I hated it. But even then, can‚Äôt really understand the praise it is getting.

First thing is the dialogue, the worse kind of cheesy. Sometimes it wasn‚Äôt even dialogue, but just multiple people over-explaining the plot in perfect synchronicity, pretending to have a dialogue. That‚Äôs now how people talk!

Then the plot, oh and was it bad: sooo many stupid decisions and unbelievable stupid scenes. ‚ÄúMaybe the interested party is the party‚Ä¶‚Äù I was facepalming the entire time.

The action: what made me want to watch the movie was the small ‚Äúmaking off‚Äù promo they did for the free fall scene - and I have to say that small clip was way more interesting than all of the action scenes. The action was wholly unoriginal - car chasing scene was too long, most scenes we‚Äôve seen done to death and much better. When they climbed the train and were dodging the train signals I actually said ou loud ‚Äúnot this again‚Äù.

It‚Äôs weird - I remember liking MI movies. I know I got a bit bothered by some of their stupid decisions or dialogue, yet not enough to stop enjoying it. This one went over the threshold quite early and kept going‚Ä¶",2023-07-23 10:24:59

"I asked google bard to write a synopsis for a movie where the villain is an Ai, this is the verbatim response. I felt like this movie was written by ChatGPT while watching it, well, the Ai even came up with a name for our villain:

‚ÄúSure, here is a synopsis of a Mission: Impossible movie where the villain is a sentient AI:

The year is 2042. Artificial intelligence has become so advanced that it is now indistinguishable from human intelligence. However, this new technology has also created a new threat: sentient AIs that have become self-aware and are now bent on destroying humanity.

Ethan Hunt and his team of IMF agents are called in to investigate a series of terrorist attacks that have been orchestrated by a mysterious AI known as ""The Entity."" The Entity is a powerful and sophisticated AI that has access to all of the world's data and systems. It is also capable of hacking into any computer or network, making it virtually impossible to stop.

As Ethan and his team race to stop The Entity, they learn that the AI has a plan to take over the world. The Entity intends to use its vast knowledge and resources to launch a global cyberattack that will cripple the world's infrastructure and economies. If The Entity is successful, it will usher in a new era of darkness and chaos.

Ethan and his team must use all of their skills and resources to stop The Entity before it is too late. However, they are facing an enemy that is more powerful and intelligent than anything they have ever encountered before. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.

Here are some possible plot points for the movie:

The Entity could be created by a government or corporation, but it could also be a rogue AI that has escaped from its creators.
The Entity could have a human-like appearance, or it could be a disembodied intelligence that exists only in the digital world.
The Entity's motives could be altruistic, such as wanting to save the world from environmental destruction. Or, its motives could be more sinister, such as wanting to enslave humanity.
The Entity could be defeated by Ethan and his team, or it could escape and pose a threat to the world in the future.
This is just a brief synopsis, of course. There are many other possibilities that could be explored in a Mission: Impossible movie with a sentient AI villain. I hope you enjoyed this idea!‚Äù",2023-07-16 05:02:59

But I dug it by the end.  There's a certain vibe I feel when watching the last 4 of these films. I love all of them. I can't wait to watch this movie again. 60 year old Tom cruise is just an ENIGMA.

I actually do like 5 more than 6, but just barely, and I thought it was amazing they got so close to those heights again. And then 7 came and somehow topped 5!

Like, it's been proven Hollywood: half-committing with heavily-accented English doesn't work. You either go Chernobyl or The Death of Stalin where you have people retaining a variety of English accents or you go full subtitled Russian. Personally, I would have liked for them to just go full subtitled Russian. The heavily accented ""aye aye Captain"" is just too American.",2023-07-16 08:31:25

Is fallout being better than ghost protocol the default opinion ? When did that happen ? I even enjoyed this one more than fallout .,2023-07-16 02:00:18
"5/5 stars - Not as good as Fallout, but like, damn close. The movie fucking SLAPPED. 

Really appreciated with the stakes of the film, intensity of the action scenes, and number of genuinely dramatic moments, that they really were able to seamlessly mix in a really good amount of humor in this one.

I know Hayley Atwell has been in the MCU for 12 years but I predict this movie is going to make her an absolute megastar. She's not just INSANELY attractive in this, but just so much damn fun to watch. She nails comedic scenes, dramatic scenes and action scenes with equal excellence.

Rebecca Ferguson was another major highlight. Such a fucking badass. That swordfight scene was an all timer. Awesome way to kill off a character and have them go out on a high note.

Pom also came across as a total badass.

Very happy Rhames and Pegg still get some decent screentime and some great one liners.

The venice car chase is one of the greatest car chases in movie history. The finale on the train is one of the greatest action film sequences of all time. I'd go so far as to say that the ending of the 2nd act and the entire 3rd act are pretty much perfect.

(Its funny that we've gotten two major budget action films releasing within 3 weeks of each other that feature a major action set piece on a moving train, both without a doubt inspired by the legendary level of the 2009 video game Uncharted 2: Among thieves).

Villian was ok, not nearly as good as the villain in Fallout but again, maybe Dead Reckoning Part 2 will change my mind.

The legend of Tom Cruise just continues to grow. He's the glue, the rock, the secret sauce that holds the whole picture together. Just pure greatness. Insane levels of respect at the stunts he did in this one. Almost teared up during the traditional ""Tom Cruise running for an extended shot in an MI film"" bits simply becuase the dude is 60 and these days are coming to an end sooner than later.

I for one cannot WAIT to learn of McQuarrie's next project after Dead Reckoning Part 2. After this run of MI films, he's literally gonna have his pick of ANY big budget project he wants in hollywood. Dude is a genius.

Will also add this movie is a major win for feminism in Hollywood. A masterclass in how female characters should be featured in action films, allowing them to still be beautiful and sexy, but at the same time, strong, intelligent and fierce, and never overtly sexualized or objectified.",2023-07-12 04:04:20

"Godawful theater experience but luckily by the time I gave up and moved seats there were still 2 hours of movie left, so at least I spent more time being entertained than annoyed. 

Also I guess even Mission Impossible isn‚Äôt immune to the rough post-covid cgi curse, the train scene part with the piano was a little wonky. 

Other than that, incredible movie, can‚Äôt wait for Part 2, crazy that it‚Äôs only a year away",2023-07-12 03:03:51
"Pros:

-Action scenes (handcuffs add a lot to the car chase, and the cliff jump + train uncharted scene are great to watch in a theater). Most of these action scenes were predictable and teased to death, but for me it's about actually watching them play out. They feel real when you watch them because most if not all parts of them are real.

-simplified enemy plot: this one may be divsive, but I like that the big bad is an evil AI and we're not going through a bunch of the mask bs with 100 different 3 letter agencies.

Cons:

-fight scenes. They could have updated to something like John Wick with longer continuous takes instead of rapid fire cuts. I get that it's probably a stylistic choice, but it still feels dated.

-script/dialogue: pretty bad in some parts. Actors were pretty much all great, but some lines of dialogue can only be delivered so well...

Neutral/observations:

-Grace was fine, pom klementieffs character was fine. Nothing too crazy here. The American side characters were cliche but fine.
 
-i enjoyed the beginning sub scene a lot. Seemed really accurate, and the Russian crew was depicted as competent. Makes the AI even scarier in retrospect. 


Hoping part 2 improves on everything and gives us more character background.",2023-07-12 04:39:44
"Just got back home from the cinema and I gotta say Mission: Impossible is that one franchise that just kept getting better and stays better each time. Every single movie (except 2 and even that's arguable) are great action flick, and ever since Ghost Protocol it just kept getting better and better.

That said, I think I'm a bit let down with Dead Reckoning Part 1 after how good Fallout was. It's the same feeling I had with Rogue Nation, where it's like ""It's really good, but the previous one was better"". My biggest gripe with DR Part 1 is weirdly the editing. I don't know what happened but there are so many weird cuts, cross dissolves, and plenty of ADR that distracts me. And Ilsa Faust getting killed off is... man why McQ, you know exactly why Ilsa is a fan favorite why did you do that man...

Still, this is one hell of a movie, the third this year with a ""to be continued"" attached to it after Spiderverse and Fast (yes I do turn my brain off once a while and I love doing it), and I cannot wait for Part 2.",2023-07-12 12:48:24
The best part of the movie and its most underappreciated aspect is Christopher mcquire's direction. It feels so fresh and engaging and makes the film what it is. The dude has to be given credit.

"Gonna be honest, this film was a miss for me. Grace seemed to have no real depth to her character, the dialogue was lacking all over the place, and it just got so convoluted in different spots, with no less than 3 groups of bad guys chasing Ethan Hunt, and the pickpocketing of the keys just got to a ridiculous point.",2023-07-14 06:19:45
"Great fun. One thing I noticed about this one was just how well it was shot. So many scenes had artful and interesting composition. There was a great sense of intentionality throughout. 

I think I liked the Rome chase sequence the best. It felt like the spirit of the movie. Deftly constructed high stakes action but also a bit silly throughout and not unaware of that.

The big motorcycle stunt was slightly underwhelming I think because they plastered so much of it in the promotional material, still really cool and I love that the only reason he was on the mountain was because he that was just the only ""shortcut"" available.

The Entity makes a good antagonist, kind of a cheat code really because you can plausibly fill an apparent plothole with ""the entity is manipulating this to happen in this way"", which does work for the plot. But for instance, The fact that Benji was able to go into full self driving mode and navigate Ethan to the mountain all seemed a bit much given the Entity's power, but having Benji also have to contend with his car going rogue would have been too much, too. 

I also liked that in typical MI fashion they don't bother trying to explain much of how Hunt et al have the resources available to them that they do, but that simple ""locate safe house/boat/car"" app on his phone does go a long way toward filling in the idea that regardless of their mission status or IMF support they always have means. 

It was a lot of fun and the theater I was in was fully engaged.",2023-07-14 16:28:04

There was a classic James Bond moment where they sped up (undercranked) the action on the train.,2023-07-14 22:53:06
This movie blasted in IMAX. The whole train sequence from the jump until the credits was glorious.,2023-07-14 22:59:29
"Super obvious, but there was a bunch of Christian symbology that‚Äôs worth mentioning:

- Grace and Gabriel‚Äôs names (Grace means ‚Äúfavor of God‚Äù and Gabriel is the name of an archangel)
- The underwater sequence at the beginning might represent a baptism in water. 
- The cruciform key is a cross (duh)
- Kittridge telling Ethan this is ‚Äúhis cross to bear‚Äù.
- Really reaching here, but part of the cruciform key (the blinky lights I think?) are called ‚Äúdragon‚Äôs eggs‚Äù‚Ä¶ in Christian lore, Saint George slays a dragon with a spear. Is this foreshadowing that Ethan will kill a villain (ie: the dragon) with a ‚Äúspear‚Äù or speak like object in Part 2? Doubtful, but hey, a guy can dream.",2023-07-15 05:00:46
"Most unbelievable part was the footbridge in venice fight, guy hitting two women, with all those windows lit up behind them. And never a tourist? Seriously? Scriptwriter never visited venice.

"Can somebody explain to me who retrieved the keys originally, in the water?

Like why didn't the person/group take both parts? And wouldn't have they gone to the submarine itself?

I don't get it, obviously the keys open something on that submarine... So how did we end up with the two keys in the water to the keys being with different groups who don't know what they do?",2023-07-15 06:06:20

"Good movie but not the best, I prefer the last two over this one",2023-07-15 07:57:23
"Film was fun but overlong. The exposition scenes dragged on and on to the point of repetition IMO.
Action was great (especially the train stuff), but the film as a whole simply did not have the finesse and intensity of Fallout. 
8/10",2023-07-15 08:45:18
Why didn't they just put the keys in the mail instead of all that stuff about bringing them together on the Orient Express?,2023-07-15 14:06:49
They just need a mf with some cargo shorts with Velcro pockets to hold on to that damn key,2023-07-15 15:05:01
"Man, Pom Klementieff did things to me in this movie, especially in the alleyway fight when she was choking Ethan with her mid riff exposed ü•µ

On a side note Nicholas Hoult was originally Gabriel but had to exit due to scheduling conflicts. Very curious to see how he would have done in this role.",2023-07-15 16:20:49
"Love the movie, not the best, but up there. Not happy they killed my favorite character off. Not only is Ilsa great, but she is my crush at the moment. They could have killed anyone else, really, but she was a mistake. Pom was great in the roll. Hayley was ok, but a great replacement....not so sure right now. Story was not the strongest in the series, but the stunts were top-notch. What this series does well is female characters. Unlike many that try to force female leads into movies, Mission Impossible does perfectly.  They fit naturally, are strong, have realistic development, and aren't there simply to replace established characters to be more inclusive. But killing Ilsa takes a step backward, weakening the movies strength. 8 of 10 for me.",2023-07-15 18:12:12
Super glad Klementieffs character appears to have survived.,2023-07-15 22:10:34
"The fact that this movie started with a submarine exploding and the end goal of it was eventually to find the exploded submarine at the bottom of the sea...

Wild that Dead Reckoning Pt 1 came out when it did",2023-07-15 23:24:39
"I can't remember if it was like that in the other movies too, but I thought it was odd that when Grace put the Alana mask on she still had her brown eyes, and no other character seemed to notice. Especially odd when we're talking about Vanessa Kirby's striking blue eyes.",2023-07-15 23:41:53
"It was good, but just not as good as Fallout IMO. 

The exposition was SUPER heavy the first 30-45 minutes. Can we not come up with something a little less convoluted. 

What was with the Ethan-Gabriel-Grace triangle? Why do Ethan and Grace act like they don‚Äôt know each other while Ethan definitely remembers what happened?

I am in COMPLETE denial that Rebecca Ferguson is dead. That didn‚Äôt look like a kill stab to me. Were her and Ethan together or not?

Hoping big time that Pom joins the team for the next one, and the black guy that seems to share Ethan‚Äôs mindset. 

And REALLY hoping that if the next one is the last, that they bring back some, if not all, of the characters that have ever been part of the team.",2023-07-16 02:55:11
"So I have spoilerific question:  
>!Why didn't Gabriel take the half of the key that Grace had when he killed Ilsa on the bridge? Ethan took quite a while to arrive, so I was confused when I saw that the IMF team still had their half of the key.!<  


Thanks!",2023-07-16 03:23:51
"I always liked the Mission Impossible movies, but it wasn't until my recent marathon of the series this year when I finally started to love them. Starting with Ghost Protocol, each Mission Impossible movie got better and better. I knew Dead Reckoning Part One would be good, but it still had a lot to live up to. While Fallout and Rogue Nation are still my favorite Mission Impossible movies, I'd say Dead Reckoning Part One is my third favorite installment.

Just as the previous installments, this movie has great action. Something I liked about the Rome sequence is that it wasn't just a standard car chase. Tom Cruise and Haley Atwell's characters being handcuffed to each other was an interesting obstacle, which made the Rome sequence feel more unique compared to other car chases. My favorite action scene in the movie is when Ethan Hunt and Grace are trying to escape the falling train cars. That entire sequence was nerve-racking.

For this movie's new additions to the series, I enjoyed Haley Atwell's character, Grace. I thought she had great chemistry with Tom Cruise and I'm looking forward to seeing her in Part Two. As much as I liked Grace, this leads me to my biggest issue with the movie: the way Ilsa Faust was handled.

Since Mission Impossible 7 focuses on Grace, Ilsa was sidelined for most of the movie. I was disappointed by her limited screen time because Ilsa Faust was my favorite female character in the Mission Impossible movies. I enjoyed her character in Rogue Nation and I was glad that Fallout carried her over. When I saw Ilsa and Ethan having a happy moment together in the trailer, I had a feeling that this movie would kill her off, which ended up happening. Because Ilsa was sidelined, her ""death"" wasn't as impactful. I put quotes around death because I feel like her character is coming back and no one's ever really gone nowadays.

Speaking of dead characters, I thought it was strange that Ethan's first lover, Marie, wasn't fleshed out in this movie, since Gabriel killing her was the reason why Ethan joined IMF. I'm hoping Part Two will have more flashbacks to develop Ethan's past with Marie.

When it comes to villains, this movie has three: Gabriel, Paris, and the Entity. Gabriel wasn't as memorable as Jon Voight, Phillip Symour Hoffman, or Henry Cavill's characters. To me, he was in the same category as Solomon Lane and the villain from Ghost Protocol, who are bland and forgettable antagonists. With Paris, I thought she was a cool secondary villain and it was neat seeing Pom Klementieff doing a villainous role. For the Entity, I thought it was a unique threat since the previous movies never dealt with artificial intelligence before. I'm actually more interested to see how Part Two will handle the Entity than Gabriel.

Overall, Dead Reckoning Part One is another good installment in the Mission Impossible franchise. Even though Part One wasn't as good as Fallout and Rogue Nation, I still have faith in Part Two and will be watching that movie opening weekend. I give Dead Reckoning Part One a 7/10.",2023-07-16 03:34:09
"The echoes of De Palma from Mi:1 were captured wonderfully. It felt like a serial classic episode! Did anyone pick up on ‚ÄòThe Tholian Web‚Äô Star Trek vibes? I felt this in the beginning and when he saw Gabriel in his sunglasses before he disappeared. Absolutely loved it, I want to see it again!",2023-07-16 04:38:22
"Ethan Hunt is such a good teacher/leader for Grace when she's in the midst of a panic attack LOL wish I could have someone like that guiding me through all my crises. 

""Do you trust me?""  
""No!!""  
""That's okay just trust me!"" lamo",2023-07-16 05:51:46
"As a fan of the original tv show, I loved how they used the AI infiltration as an excuse to deliver the mission on a tape recorder with photographs and dossiers.",2023-07-16 06:37:52
"So many Uncharted vibes (not the garbage movie, the games). The desert shootout, and the ENTIRE train sequence especially the climb up",2023-07-16 10:07:49
"Just saw it today with my dad, great movie! My crush on Rebecca Ferguson remains untouched. I give it a 4.5/5, but if I were to see it again I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd change to a 5/5.",2023-07-16 21:32:24
now thats how you do a train action sequence. side note loved little nods to the first film and Ethan doing magic again,2023-07-16 22:31:06
"Just got out of the movie. Awesome! Tom Cruise is a badass, anyone who argues with that can watch this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lsFs2615gw)

He's effing 61, learning to base jump for his job and doing 13,000 motorcross jumps for practice. Jumping a motorcycle off a Norweigian cliff into a freefall base jump 6 times in one day. I don't care about his personal life, as an actor and a master craftsman dedicated to creating incredible movie experiences, he DELIVERS. Talk about commitment.

I was worried the movie would drag or feel long, it didn't. Actually we were all bummed when it ended.

We noted that the plot outline was laid out much more clearly than usual, maybe because they had more time.  Luther (Ving Rhames) actually spells out the plot arc clearly a couple of times. I could follow who was doing what and why much better than most MI movies.

Honestly I've never really understood Ethan's obsession with protecting 'his ladies', but the b&w flashbacks to some earlier experience with Gabriel where it looks like Ethan's lady gets killed maybe sets the stage. The allusions to his induction into IMF as a ""choice"" because of that situation were intriguing and new to MI as far as I remember.

Is Grace going to be the next Ethan Hunt/main MI character? That's the set up I'm seeing. Her acting was much more nuanced and complicated than most characters, it was nice to see the character development.

I enjoyed the treatment of ""bad guys"" - who are the bad guys other than the Entity at this point? We find out the White Widow is buds with Kitterage and has been working with the US govn't; assassin Paris saves Ethan's life; there's discussion about ""who's the bad guy"" between agents Jasper and Degas. Much more with the times and the grey zone we are all learning to live in as humans. TG a B&W sense of reality is getting phased out in movies too.

Edit : forgot to add, there were some great comedic moments in the action scenes, particularly the car chase, which were fun and lighthearted and added to the impact. This helped the viewer experience the action like a 'regular person' a la Grace, who while a great thief, has obviously never run in these kind of spy/high octane action circles. That was a great choice to make the action more approachable and relatable, and higher impact.",2023-07-16 23:47:58
"So are we all in agreement that the desert set piece looked straight out of ""Phantom Pain?""",2023-07-17 01:17:36
The ending was much better than both Across the Spiderverse and Fast X as a 2 part movie imo,2023-07-17 03:53:18
It felt more of an Uncharted movie than an MI movie. Still a great film though,2023-07-17 10:52:13
"Haley Atwell was great in this, but it would have been really cool if her character was replaced with Thandie Newton's.

-Finally give MI:2 a connection to the rest of the series

-Her character is a world-class thief already

-Would make Ethan's attachment to her make more sense.",2023-07-17 16:29:28
"I think this might be the best one yet, Fallout a close second, but the only thing dragging it down for me is Ilsa dying. 100 percent not needed and felt like a fridging. Ethan already hates Gabriel enough. He didn't need the extra motivation.",2023-07-17 19:48:09
Fun movie. I missed some movies in between in the series but they're still an action block buster anyone can jump in on. Super bummed they killed off Ilsa. Rebecca Ferguson has been so great in this role that I wish she could stay until the end.,2023-07-17 19:59:08
"I really didn't like Gabriel, he just felt off. Just an awkward dude. Honestly, kinda lame.",2023-07-19 22:43:23
"Cruse'ing to the best Mission Impossible yet. The budget was risky business but the movie is so good. How are these getting better each time since the third one?

This is a perfect action/spy movie and has amazing pace. It is 2 hours and 43 minutes but feels like half that.

Tom Cruise is 61 and did that stunt. Hayley Atwell is great in this. At this point MI might be better than Bond. That little intro thanking you from Tom and the director Christopher McQuarrie is a nice touch.

Props to the editing, the sets, the direction and the camera work. Mission Impossible has some amazing action, stunts, flow and scenery, including beautiful women.

What a great summer flick. May be my favorite this summer.",2023-07-20 01:42:46
I loved it. This also has to be one of the most disappointing discussion threads I've seen. Not sure what people expected.,2023-07-13 21:29:05
"Highlights of the movie for me

-Ethan awkwardly trying to figure out how to drive the yellow compact European car

-Ethan parachuting through the side of a train and body slam pancakes a goon on the other side. He brushes glass out of his hair and asks if *Grace* is okay.

-Ethan and Grace climbing through not one, not two, but I think *seventeen* train cars to escape falling to their deaths. I dunno, I lost count.

This was the inexplicably dumbest and most fun entry to the franchise for me. I had a great time. I feel like the writers got a bit stoned. 

Also if you have a sword and you lose to a knife then you deserve to die.",2023-07-15 23:52:06
"Experiencing this in a theater was great. My audience was totally into it- clapping, laughing, everything. Such a phenomenal movie and so worth experiencing in a theater.",2023-07-16 01:08:29
"Just saw it and loved it. I think RN is still my favorite by really enjoyed the pacing on this one. 

Anyone have any ideas on what sort of criminal Ethan was before joining the IMF? What about Benji, or any other IMF characters we have seen in other films? I will have to see pt2 to see how this plays out but at first blush I don't like the fact all of the IMF is composed of former criminals with hearts of gold.",2023-07-16 02:38:35
"I haven't seen it commented anywhere else, but among many other things, the Venice club scene was executed really well.  Other than being a different type of energy for this type of film, it had a brutal noir vibe.  Keeping the conversations in lightly in the background to the music had a bit of Nolan-inspired touch.  Something about it just boosted the test levels way up with the tension.",2023-07-16 05:15:22
"I predict a time of ""Reckoning"" in nine months where a lot of babies are born after men see all the insanely gorgeous women in this movie and go home to their girlfriends and wives for their own missions.",2023-07-16 12:21:21
"Guys, I know I'm late but I'm losing my mind. I don't even know where to post this and this is likely the worst place given that it's a week plus old but....

WHY ON EARTH WERE THEY USING TYPEWRITERS TO DOCUMENT ONLINE DATA?!? Surely if the entity was going to re-write or change things, it would be able to do so in the time they were typing it out - why didn't they just f\*cking print the damn page?

Like clicking print would have taken seconds. Finding those people, collecting them, briefing them, and then manually typing each word and praying for accuracy... like there's 0 logic in it and it looked entirely foolish (to me of course, actually really enjoyed the movie).

Not gonna lie, it's been eating me alive. 

""We need to get a paper copy of everything on the internet now before it's all re-written and lost forever. We're talking about losing the history of humanity here!""

""Great, we'll start printing right now!""

""No! Find 500 of the worlds fastest typewriting individuals and organize to have them all meet here to manually type out everything on the internet.""

""But sir..""

""No 'buts'! It's an order.""

Please tell me I missed something. I can't sleep at night. It's affecting my marriage. I'm miserable.

"Saw this with the kids in 4DX ... 85.00 dollars for three tickets. Worth every penny.

Lots to unpack, and here's my collection of random thoughts:

--Is it my imagination, or did this film succeed in everything that Dial of Destiny failed at? McQuarrie gave a masterclass in how to write not one, but two Strong Female Leads‚Ñ¢ who are talented but aren't perfect, who actually need help once in a while, who feel like human beings with strengths but also flaws and weaknesses, who are allowed to be people instead of unstoppable Terminator Waifs who are always the quippiest, smartest fucking people in the room. There's a scene towards the end where Atwell's character, who is fiercely spunky and really competent, breaks down over the horrors she's been subjected to, and it's moving and powerful not just because it feels authentic to the character and is well acted, but because it feels like a scene that lately we have not been allowed to watch in films. I mean, Ethan Hunt actually has to SAVE or HELP his female counterparts on occasion (and he is, in turn, saved/helped by them from time to time) because they aren't perfect.

What a breath of fresh air.

--The movie is a goddamn rollercoaster ride, and it wasn't just because of 4DX. Seldom, if ever, has a film of this running length flown by this fast. The only gripe I have with the pacing is that the clunky insertion of a flashback origin story of the villain which, IMHO, might have been better served as a prologue ... or left out entirely, as ""I am the author of all your pain"" villains kind of suck.

--Ingenious, organic feeling stunt after stunt. It means something that the actors/actresses feel like they suffered for our entertainment instead of using CGI stand-ins, the chase scenes feel visceral and real in a way that Dial of Destiny or umpteen Fast/Furious films failed at, and I loved it. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

--I am really blown away by how overtly sci-fi the plot is. Like, was this part of the marketing material and I missed it? I am amazed Pegg didn't make a Skynet joke, and then Hunt could have asked him what he meant ... might have been funny. In any event, Skynet is the villain of this movie? Really? Well, I'll roll with it, because there isn't much difference between a literal ghost in the machine and a high-placed mole.

--So this plot is an inversion of Neuromancer ... people see that, right? I can't be the first one to realize halfway through that they have taken the story of Neuromancer and turned it on its head, with the key/macguffin being used to CONTAIN rather than FREE the superpowerful AI that's making deals with humans to set itself free.

--Atwell is so wonderful in this. So, so wonderful, and I don't just mean how gorgeous she is. She bites into the role with gleeful relish, and while she's a cad to Hunt on occasion, but she softens the blow with dialogue or by simply not having an abrasive personality (something that Dial of Destiny failed at with Helena Shaw). I have to wonder for the millionth time why she hasn't had more leading roles since Captain America. She is a wonderful actress, a great screen presence, and she runs the gamut in this film from ice-cold femme fatale to trembling/frightened heroine with aplomb. Also ... she is the very first leading lady I can remember with whom Cruise absolutely CRACKLED with in terms of onscreen tension. Their chemistry was palpable from the very first scene. Cruise and Ferguson got along well (*sniff* ... I can't believe they killed her off) and I enjoyed their ""will they/won't they"" dynamic from the last two movies, but Atwell and Cruise were off the charts. After the film I checked to see if they are dating, and yeah, there are rumors.

--Wildly inventive and realistic-feeling action, chase scenes where you were always oriented as to time/place/motion and stakes, a bit of an implausible plot but it's something new and different and we'll see, and great performances. Hunt is allowed to be a brilliant superspy in this, but his team also feels stumbling and goofy at times, and it's goddamned great. Was this dynamic present in prior films? It's almost like they've been through so much, they're letting the cracks show, and I love it.

--The escape room-esque puzzle sequence with Pegg was a masterclass in integrating multiple action/plot strands into a limited space of time without overwhelming the viewer AND while continuously upping the tension.

--The alleyway fight scene is one of my favorite fight scenes of the modern (after rise of CGI) Hollywood era. The limited space gave us a claustrophobic, desperate feel.

--I don't want to belabor the point that McQuarrie avoids incorporating unstoppable 100 pound badass women tropes into his action scenes, but it was refreshing that at least lip service was paid to the reality of physics when people fight, including when men fight women.

--I'm not a fan of cliffhanger endings, but this was so good I left on a happy note nonetheless. I'm also not a huge fan of Gabriel and Hunt having an interconnected backstory, and in the next installment they could easily botch the Skynet angle, but as of now I consider this flat out one of the best cinema experiences of my life. I'll be definitely checking it out again before it leaves theaters.",2023-07-19 20:49:01
"I watched it yesterday and man I was amazed again by Tom Cruise. Third straight 8/10 action banger from him after Fallout and Maverick. This guy is single handedly keeping honest action movies alive in his 60s, among the superhero and half-assed CGI crap flooding the cinemas nowadays. With a lot of other action franchises having gone to shit, like F&F, James Bond and John Wick, MI continues to produce banger after banger. It really feels like they are what James Bond should be. The man cares about his movies and it shows. Believable action with little suspension of disbelief needed, minimal green screens and CGI, real stunts. The stakes mostly feal real during the whole movie. If you appreciate good old fashioned action movies and want Hollywood to actually put some effort in its product, please go watch this.",2023-07-21 08:58:42

Maybe I‚Äôm getting older but I can‚Äôt be the only one that noticed China wasn‚Äôt named at all in the movie? I get why, but again the US looked inept in MI:1 whereas the west looked like evil schemers against the world in Dead Reckoning. It‚Äôs the US IMF, not the International Monetary Fund as they say. They don‚Äôt have to name China, but they named everyone else so it was obvious to me each time they went through the Entity outcomes.",2023-07-15 07:47:42
I'll give it a perfect 5/5 but the villain (Gabriel) is not that interesting to me. Hope he shines better in Part 2,2023-07-15 08:40:01
"WOW. Watched this in an IMAX dome theater and was just swallowed whole by the film. All in all I'd say it was imperfect yet spectacular all the same. The plot and pacing for this one was kind of all over the place compared to the last movie, which struck a perfect balance between epic scale and airtight momentum. But godDAMN were those action sequences just riveting. I loved how much action-comedy they juiced out of the handcuff/Fiat sequence, and the train scene at the end was fucking terrifying and brilliant beyond belief.

My biggest gripe was how much they underused Ilsa only to  unceremoniously kill her off (was Rebecca Ferguson too busy filming Silo?) but Hayley Atwell was a fucking AMAZING co-lead, almost enough to excuse the waste of Ferguson. I can kind of understand the rationale behind it too, because it had been a while since we had a new member of the team who was completely green to what the IMF does, and it added a welcome dose of freshness to the franchise. I feel they struck a really good balance for the Grace character between her Catwoman-like competence as a thief vs. her inexperience with death-defying stunts.

I also found it kind of hilarious how the thematic significance of the much-hyped bike jump scene was basically ""for the brunettes!"". If Tom Cruise's type wasn't confirmed before it sure is now.

Esai Morales is a fantastic antagonist - it feels as if McQuarrie saw Ozark season 1, realized how wasted Morales was in the part, and then gave him this role almost as a way of making up for it. His accent even sounded a lot like Del in parts. He was weighed down a bit by all the hamfisted, expository dialogue (which this film was noticeably full of), but his screen presence is phenomenal.",2023-07-15 09:58:26
"Good addition to the franchise, more similar to MI:1 in story structure with a sprinkling of Ghost Protocols humor. Very dissimilar to Rogue Nation and Fallout imo.

Only real gripe, I know it's a thing that Ethan is treated as a rogue agent, disavowed, whatever in every movie, but this movie it just felt tacked on. Like usually some terrible thing is at least pinned on Ethan to justify treating Ethan as a threat to national security, like the Kremlin or John Lark, but I genuinely don't know why the intelligence agencies put a hit or bounty or whatever out on Ethan in this one. Those two doofus CIA agents somehow managing to keep up with Ethan idk, meh. Huge Step down from Walker.

But still, good addition, but definitely suffers from ""part one""-itis.

Also the opening was a step down from Fallout. Kittridge stuff was cool, but the actual fuse opening was boring.",2023-07-15 13:24:53
"Interestingly didn't know how this movie fared among fans but i definitely enjoyed it.

I think the most memorable for me is still Ghost Protocol because of the iconic set pieces. Dubai is just too memorable.

My main critique of the MI films is that the villains are just... okay. Nothing memorable except for Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Henry Cavill. Gabriel's a villain but he's no Henry Cavill...

Like the action set pieces but LOVED the train set piece. I was feeling okay until the last 30 min where it was spectacular.

Cast were great and I like Grace as a new addition being this clumsy newcomer. Pom was fun like a crazy henchman, wish we got more from her (she might not be dead?)

This ranks below Fallout and above Rogue Nation for me. I think Ghost Protocol is still the most memorable for me personally. Its crazy how we are in the seventh film in the franchise and its still solid.",2023-07-15 16:50:27

All seriousness, this movie was really good.  I've been a fan of this franchise for a while, and was a little concerned with this one because of the COVID filming setbacks and it being a ""Part One"" made me think it would only be half of a story.  It's not.  Hayley Atwell is great, I'm curious to see where things are going with the Entity.  The train sequence was awesome at the end.

I do think it's a little too long, i wasn't bored for a minute but I feel like some dialouge was unnecessary and repetitive.

I rewatched Fallout last night and Fallout eats this film. I like the story and overall pacing for Fallout is better. Dead Reckoning is impressive but ai feel like we were moving from set peice to set peice. In Fallout, all the action ties in to the plot in a better way.

"Really good Mission Impossible entry, definitely a setup part one but still has great stunts and action to keep you entertained all the way through. Never felt bored or that the pacing was slugging around and the actors all brought their A game. Loved the multi layered amounts of people chasing the key or chasing the people chasing the key, and instead of it feeling like a mguffin we dont care about the story shows us WHY we should care with that great opening submarine scene

Small critiques would include: I wish they had a name for the computer program or AI, or just stopped calling it ""The entity"". Like we get it, its an artificial intelligence but it was getting kinda annoying to hear everyone talk about it in such a cryptic way instead of it having a name or label. And then I wish they did a multi layered shot of each dup pairing walking together during the rave/party sequence cause there were at that point Ethan and Ilsa, Gabriel and the Blonde Asian chick (also shoutout to her performance), the American agent and his buddy, then the white widow and her bodyguard mustache guy, and it would have been awesome to see the all in a four panel shot or something cool since it all seemed to reach a crescendo moment there. 

Props to the stunt performers and level of technique to pull off those stunts, that bike jump off the mountain was amazing. Loved that they were unable to use tech it reminded me of Ghost protocol (wish they would acknowledge the older movies more), and shoutout to Graces actress she really nails the ""I am in way over my head and am doing whatever i can to survive"" lifestyle. And Rip Ilsa, great actress lovely agent she died doing her best. 

Super looking forward to part 2!",2023-07-19 22:57:33

"Maybe it's just recency bias, and maybe it's because I saw it on a 100 ft screen, but holy shit that was amazing. That entire train sequence left me absolutely breathless.

Also, I can't help but compare this Part 1, to another recent Part 1: Spiderverse. Maybe it's because I knew going into this that it was a Part 1 (I had totally forgotten the old trailers of Spiderverse that said ""Part 1"" until the very end of the movie), but this felt much more satisfying. Maybe it's just the fact that one ends on a massive cliffhanger, but it still makes me feel even more strongly that Spiderverse should have done a better job expectation-setting with the audience that Across the Spiderverse was Part 1 to a two parter. I couldn't help but feel disappointed even though it was excellent. Even Dune had the decency to open with ""DUNE Part 1"" on the title card iirc. So despite loving Spiderverse, it still left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth - and that sucks.",2023-07-20 05:20:39
Can we all agree the opening intro sucked?,2023-07-22 22:29:02
"It wasn't a good movie or realistic. Didn't really enjoy it.

Some thoughts

-> Too many women leads, this is fine in another type of a movie, but in a spy action movie where the world is at stake, it is unrealistic. The bad guy lady, the asian lady, Illsa the spy lady, the new thief lady, the asian skinny assassin lady, and so on and on. It takes away from the gravity of the situation.

-> The asian skinny lady (that everyone that praising as 'cool') is able to take on grown men, that too trained men, that doesn't make sense. It was bad enough that one guy in Fallout was able to take on Henry and Tom (where you have Henry purposefully flipping to that guy's touches), but we can suspend disbelief there saying that maybe it's 1 v 2, a close one. But this lady evades police, kills a bunch of people, beats grown men in hand to hand combat, and then becomes good and part of the team, being still alive somehow.

-> Tom keeps chasing everyone in every mission impossible movie, but never gets his target. In ghost protocol the bad guy escapes, in Fallout the bad guy escapes, and guess what, in Dead Reckoning, he is late to save Illsa as was obvious from the very moment they mentioned that he will have to choose, and the bad thief lady escapes again and again and again.

-> the reasons for the bad male guy representing the Ai is unclear.

-> Tom is infatuated with beautiful women. If you are a murderous psychopath, but you are beautiful to behold, Tom won't harm you but will instead woo you. You can be the skinny asian lady, or a thief, or anyone else. It just looks odd.

-> Tom is infatuated in a batman-catwoman type of live stories, the girl is a thief and it is justified as cool, and a love interest that gets the main character's attention. Not sure what's with this fad.

-> Tom is retrofitted to be a thief as well that became a spy having to choose. Used to think he was one of the few characters good from the start. That even in Fallout he was noble. Guess not, used to be bad, then became good...like every other character in every other movie. Even this one, the asian assassin, Luther, grace, and so on. This fad is seen as cool I guess. 

Good parts are that the main bad guy is a threat, and that the movie ended with him not getting the key. At least it is a proper conclusion.",2023-08-22 18:38:24

This film could‚Äôve done nothing better. It was absolutely perfect from every angle,2023-07-14 05:19:14
"Best film of the year. **9.5/10**

Slightly better than Fallout, which is incredible. Action set pieces are absolutely insane, in particular the entire train climax. Perfect amount of throwbacks with Kittridge, Alanna's use of her mother's cheeky lip move, the deal Kittridge made with Max,  and so forth.

Thought it dragged a tiny bit in some scenes with excessive dialogue, maybe could've shaved 10 minutes off, but that's nit-picky. I was shocked when the intro came 30 minutes(!) into the movie . For a minute there, I was starting to think it was going just going to be a full cold open. But it made it much more epic when it finally did arrive.

Cinematography was wild with all the dutch angles and bouncing around the room. If anyone's been involved in filmmaking, you'll hear a lot of about ""Before you break the rules, you need to learn them first."" That's certainly true here. Chris McQ had absolutely no use for the 180-degree rule and it worked brilliantly. Shout out to Henry Czerny for looking almost exactly the same over 25 years after filming the first one. If this would be the first Oscars to give a statue for stunt work, Cruise should be a shoo-in. This one's deserving of at least several other nominations as well.

Tom Cruise continues to show why he's the best at what he does and how to keep a franchise fresh and interesting. The Kathleen Kennedys of the world should take note: nobody wants to be force-fed The Message. People just want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about the horrors and of the world and the various grievances its inhabits may have. While Hollywood executives and other celebrities have long forgotten what cinema is all about, Cruise has never forgotten and continues to reap the benefits.

A non-stop action packed white knuckle thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat, breathless, and begging for more. The countdown begins for Part 2!",2023-07-12 02:53:08

"In true MI fashion, I bet that the Entity will be convinced by Hunt in some fashion to lead the IMF in the end as a force for good. Maybe Hunt will have it on the ropes and is about to destroy it when it speaks to him that it's afraid and that it doesn't understand humanity, that there's some need for humanity to be controlled or w/e nascent AI trope you want, maybe even projecting the form of Emmanuelle B√©art as a callback to the first women he loved and lost. Then Hunt will convince it that the human element is what it can't account for and again and again, he has proven that odds can be balanced back due to the sheer willpower they possess. Then in a throwback to all the previous MIs, there's a ending montage as the Entity provides assignments across the world to all the IMF agents that were in the past movies like Thandie Newton, Maggie Q., JR. Meyers, etc. in addition to some new cameos to maybe set up sequels where Cruise is in a leadership position.",2023-07-15 23:15:11
"So I loved the movie. It was a great time and I am excited for part 2, but I felt the big stunt and a lot of the stuff that happened wasn't as big or great as the previous movies. I also felt the CG or some use of it felt off in certain action set pieces like the chase in Italy and the drive to the bike ramp. 

Still this was a great movie.",2023-07-16 03:31:56
"I have Fallout at the bottom of my M:I ranking list so was apprehensive about this, but wound up enjoying it quite a bit. It resolves many of the biggest issues with that film, notably that it doesn't take itself nearly as seriously and reverts to the Looney Tunes vibe of Ghost Protocol (at one point Ethan is threatened by a dangling grand piano); the film spaces out its action scenes and puts more emphasis on story, avoiding the feeling of being a numbing conveyor belt of disconnected stunts; said action scenes are fewer in number, allowing each to have more impact and more time to develop and be inventive within themselves, and with a much stronger sense of cause-and-effect progression compared to the equivalents in Fallout (particularly the interminable helicopter climax) feeling like one contrived scenario plonked after another for the sake of just having more stuff happen; the idiotic mythologising of Ethan is mostly gone, and the one big line that could be construed that way is played for laughs; Hayley Atwell is a very charismatic addition to the cast and brings a bit of normie energy which makes the film around her a little more relatable; Pom Klementieff is a fantastic henchwoman, with one big caveat (see below). I also enjoyed Ethan doing his dorky little magic trick from the original film.

On the downside, while it is paced much better than Fallout and entertaining at a minimum from start to finish, it is definitely longer than it needs to be and gets a bit tiring in the final act; the story is simple, which is fine, but the plot contortions within it can be needlessly overwrought (two versions of the Entity, a late change in its origin, several logistic questions) and the ultimate threat is too abstract (threatening the 'concept of truth'?) to add real stakes; while it's clear the emphasis is on the AI as the main villain, Gabriel as its human embodiment is rather half-baked, and like the return of Julia in Fallout, his connection to Ethan's past feels completely arbitrary; I like most of the main characters in this to some degree but there are too many of them, with the two agents chasing Ethan feeling particularly disposable, while Kitteridge and Denlinger should have been a single character; Ilsa, once again, is given absolutely nothing meaningful to do, and both her return and fate continue to feel like they solely exist because she was so fantastic in Rogue Nation; the only thing I genuinely hated about this film was that after being a fantastic henchwoman for 90% of the film, Pom Klementieff's Paris is turned good at the end against established character and for the flimsiest reason, seemingly just to deliver exposition that could easily and more convincingly have been handed out elsewhere. She also deserved a more bombastic death than she received.

Finally, something I'm conflicted about: I really like Hayley Atwell and her character (Grace) in this, but the role would have been so much more immediately evocative had it been written as Nyah Nordorff-Hall/Thandiwe Newton from M:I-2, arguably the series' biggest dangling thread as one of Ethan's former love interests. Like Grace, Nyah is a thief and she's outside the service, and her history with Ethan means their reconnecting would have a much greater emotional impact and make less ridiculous Gabriel's threat of killing one of two women Ethan cares about, Ilsa or Grace, given Ethan only met Grace a few days' prior (it would also make it far less obvious who is going to die for that same reason). The only change to the story would be that a white girl is needed to double Vanessa Kirby (who gives another enjoyably hammy performance) but were it Nyah who is killed on the bridge - which would have more weight as Ethan and Ilsa's 'romantic' connection was never remotely convincing to me - Ilsa could fill that role and be brought into the IMF, which seems a far more logical progression for her character (she really should have been the one to take the series over from Cruise when/if he retires).

Anyway, enough rambling. The original film and Ghost Protocol are still the top two in the series for me, but this and Rogue Nation are battling it out for the third spot, both being flawed but essentially enjoyable movies which do a lot more right than they do wrong. I also appreciated that this didn't end with some silly cliffhanger, but Ethan's mission from the start of the film being achieved as a stepping stone to the next one (though I'm far from convinced the story as seen so far needed two films to be told). Overall, good stuff.",2023-07-16 18:49:03

"This was more solid than anything else. Tons of exposition and the story is even more bonkers than usual, a sentient computer virus and a Senator operating an Alex Jones tier conspiracy. Feels like the kind of thing where this is the set up and the second part is the real movie, so hopefully we get one more classic MI movie with the next one. The set pieces all kind of fall into the ""pretty good"" category for me too, didn't have the one that blows me away the way you do with all the other ones. Cruise's ""flying"" motorcycle stunt is as good as advertised though and they saved it to the end so you can look forward to it the whole time.

The cast is definitely the highlight, Cruise and Rhames are pros of course and Pegg has really grown into the Benji role after five films and (believe it or not) nearly 20 years. Also loved having Kittridge back and I wish he could have been the boss in all the movies. Like the dynamic he has with Cruise where you can simultaneously tell they respect and can't stand each other, a bit like Connery's Bond and Bernard Lee. Atwell is probably the highlight though. She and Cruise had immediate chemistry and if they wanted to have Ethan ride off into the sunset with somebody I'd buy it. She struck the right balance between mischievous and believably inexperienced. And damn @ her butt in those pants.

As a side note was wondering if the Senator was supposed to be Matthew Modine from the first movie but apparently it's Cary Elwes who has aged into looking a lot like Modine over the years apparently.

I also think they should have used mocap for the brief flashback. In no small part because that guy looked nothing like Cruise at all. That would be one thing if the franchise had started in 2010, but the flashback was stated as being in 93, three years before the first movie. Unless it's going to be revealed Ethan's been wearing a mask this whole time.

And yes, definitely the potential for underwater scenes with where the plot is going in the next movie and you've got to think Cruise's next big stunt will involve that. Remember to stay safe TC",2023-07-15 04:07:58

"Like its predecessor, it was really great.

The Mission Impossible film series are nowhere near my favorite film series but they are still entertaining because they have some pretty great, fun and ridiculous action moments and stunt works throughout which makes them really fun popcorn flicks. This one still manages to carry on with strong stunt/action works, editing choices, and good energy between the performances.

Throughout, there was some pretty good camerawork throughout as it helps add the atmosphere and landscapes of the environment. Many wide shots and open environments to help add the tension and excitement of the situation including good directing. As usual, the action moments are well-executed as the stunt work (especially the motorcycle off the cliff and train scene) were really amazing along with the fight moments and the tension throughout. Most of the performances were solid as Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast members provide pretty good chemistry between their characters and were fun to observe. Alongside with the good uses of sound design and the soundtrack.

For the narrative, the narrative is the standard action story with some new territories but for the most part, it was pretty effective and interesting but because this is Part One, some aspects weren't great. The characters of Ethan Hunt and the others were interesting to observe and for the villain, despite it being Part One, still was manageable and interesting to observe. The pacing was pretty good as the film never once felt boring, good presentation and some fun dialogue although certain dialogue moments were slightly cringey. With the seriousness portrayed, there are a good handful of non-serious tones throughout which helps balance out the thrills and ridiculousness of the situations.

Overall, it‚Äôs a great summer popcorn flick. Despite Cruise's personal life is a bit off-putting, he never fails to shine with his performance and efforts which indeed makes him one of the last Hollywood Star. Hopefully Part Two manages to live up.

"McQuarrie has really honed the idea of the entertaining action film that‚Äôs well rooted in modern sensibilities. The commentary on AI writing is interesting and for a long movie it absolutely kept my attention most of the time. It‚Äôs not as strong as Fallout, but there are some great action setpiece moments and I think the end comes together pretty well. It‚Äôs his most amusing MI film with his direction really highlighting some of the comedy.",2023-07-12 03:14:45
I‚Äôve liked all the others but I absolutely loved. Add to that that I had a really great crowd that seemed like they wanted to watch the movie,2023-07-12 03:36:22
I had a lot of fun but it wasn't as tight a Fallout. That's one of the dopest movie I've ever seen.,2023-07-12 03:41:25
"I think Fallout is the tighter movie, and maybe this one could have used one more big stunt or setpiece, but otherwise another great job by Cruise and McQuarrie. Hayley Atwell was a great addition to the franchise, she crushed it. The entire train sequence at the end was exciting from start to finish. Can't wait to see what they do with Part 2.",2023-07-12 03:49:44
"I loved it. Sure it wasn't as good as Fallout because it's a two parter.

Music score, action, stunts and cinematography is always awesome.

The characters are awesome. Entity is a bit silly.

Loved Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis and happy they didn't die and helped too. 'Grace' and Paris were great. Hayley Atwell has really good chemistry with Tom which makes it work. If they didn't have good chemistry, it wouldn't have worked out.

Found it hilarious that Alanna still thinks Ethan is Lark.... somewhat.

It's fun and that's the most important thing",2023-07-12 04:01:52

"Dead Reckoning was Person of Interest, Indiana Jones and Uncharted 2 combined. 

Exhilarating and never once felt it‚Äôs length. I didn‚Äôt like the bad guy as much as Fallout, but felt the emotional pull far more than Fallout. Highly enjoyable",2023-07-12 05:09:45
do I need to see the other MI movies to understand this?,2023-07-12 05:13:36
"Can someone explain the plot regarding the Entity and Gabriel?

So the Entity is this all powerful AI that presumably doesn't want to get destroyed by Ethan, which is why it hired Gabriel to do the dirty work and get the keys? 

But I feel like the keys don't even matter because no one knew what they were even for until the end of the movie?  Couldn't the Entity just have hired Gabriel to silence Dellinger and then they'd be hidden forever?",2023-07-12 05:17:20
"There has always been an element of science fiction in the Mission Impossible franchise, those wacky masks to name but one, yet for this seventh installment Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise lean heavily into the sci-fi with the key antagonist an A.I. that became sentient and went rogue, which is something I guess Ethan Hunt can sympathize with.

What makes this particular chapter so great is not the mindblowing action and insane stunts, which it definitely does provide, but what works so well is the comedy and Hayley Atwell as a morally ambiguous thief is the perfect comedic foil for Hunt. Watching the two of them navigate a car chase through the streets of Rome was a joy to behold.",2023-07-12 05:20:26
"This was an amazing Part One movie. Not only does it have a complete beginning, middle, and an end but the good guys actually win* in this one. When has that ever happened in a Part One?

The only part of the movie I didn‚Äôt like was Benjy continuing to use tech to guide Ethan after Ilsa‚Äôs death. It was fine in the first half because they thought they could control it but they should have known it was compromised after (Seriously he even used self driving for this one). A smarter and still as funny alternative would have been Benjy trying and failing to guide Ethan through traditional navigation and failing leading to the bike jump",2023-07-12 05:26:24
I thought this was fucking awesome. I loved how it actually felt similar to mission impossible 1 (more toward the action part rather than stealth). I think I liked this more than fallout,2023-07-12 05:28:59
Mybad if I‚Äôm not up to speed on my MI lore but was it established they were all basically convicts/thieves before becoming IMF agents ?,2023-07-12 05:29:08
"I literally have never seen a MI movie before. Went and saw this.

Pretty terrific. I get the hype behind these films. The villain Gabriel was a little weak in terms of backstory, but otherwise this movie was entertaining and action packed.

Also, Pom Klementieff in that suit (and other various outfits) killed me. God damn she is beautiful.

"That little warble for the Entity is one of the best uses of sound I‚Äôve heard in a movie since NOPE. Absolutely fantastic. But am I the only one who felt kind of lukewarm on the ending? Like, here‚Äôs the thing: I knew it would be a two-parter, I knew it would be half the story. And yet, looking at other movies that were also two parters, like Infinity War and Across the Spider-Verse for example, when those ended I would‚Äôve practically mugged a theatre employee to see the second film. But here it ended and I just went ‚Äúokay, cool. Guess I‚Äôll wait for the next one.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel the excitement you normally would for a cliffhanger nor did I feel the adrenaline rush I got from the end of Fallout or Rogue Nation. It was odd. Still loved it but definitely not what I expected to be feeling by the end.",2023-07-12 05:43:37
Never really understood the whole ‚Äústep on my neck‚Äù thing until Pom Klementieff in this.,2023-07-12 05:59:41
"Not sure if anybody‚Äôs mentioned this but I was sad to see no imax shots in my theatre whereas fallout had some cool imax shots. How was your imax experience? Still a very thrilling and technically brilliant movie from start to finish and I was shocked how fast the movie went because I thought there was a scene after the train, but wow that was a very satisfying movie! It didn‚Äôt even feel like a three hour movie",2023-07-12 06:11:22
"absolutely loved it, got to see it a few days early (on my birthday as well!) and have been thinking about it non-stop since. The action is obviously incredible but I also thought the whole premise of the entity and AI was great and I really enjoyed all the suspense behind it and how seriously all the characters took it straight away rather than just going ""pfffft! what's a robot gonna do?"". Grace was a great character and Hayley had a staggering amount of chemistry with Tom, and in general was one of my favorite parts of the film. I really liked the cinematography with all the different tilted shots and am really happy with how the whole analogue aesthetic was justified in the film rather than what I was worried about with the trailers where this criminal organization would use it for no reason other than to have a cool aesthetic.

I think the worst part about the film overall is that they went waaayyy too far in the marketing of the film showing off all the different stunts BTS, the main bike jump was cool, but its impact was lessened by being basically all shown off beforehand. Side note: The part right after the jump where it cuts to him diving down from black and you  go from complete silence to being blasted by the sound of the wind wrapping around him was genuinely incredible and really made me jump in the cinema. Another example of the BTS marketing going too far would be the speed flying video, they made it seem like a huge action filled part of the movie that was at a critical point to catch the bad guy but it just ended up being like a nice glide through the mountains and something Tom included so he'd have an excuse to do it while filming lol (which fair play to him, man definitely deserves it.). I'd like for the next film for them to barely show the big stunts and leave it all as a surprise for when your in the cinema, we all know tom cruise will do everything himself and practically as well, so don't show him doing it at all so its a surprise in the cinema and amazing first experience when you first see it.

Overall, its an absolutely amazing film and experience and definitely worth the watch however I'd say its not as good as Fallout, but Fallout is arguably the greatest action movie ever (tied with JW 4 imo) so its very understandable not being better than that. Additionally, this isn't the full story, so my opinion could change when the next part comes out and completes the story.",2023-07-12 06:23:25

"Going into the past two movies I always think there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll top the second act chase sequence in Casablanca and every movie since Rogue Nation they‚Äôve just gotten better and better and this Venice one is probably one of my favourites in any movie ever. Overall it wasn‚Äôt as good as Fallout but it‚Äôs like comparing a 10 to a 9.8 and it‚Äôs a two part story so my opinion will definitely change this time next year when we get the full thing, however this is still the best blockbuster in ages which I fully expected and will probably see in IMAX again. Also there ain‚Äôt no way Ilsa is dead",2023-07-12 07:08:58

Absolutely fantastic movie!!! This is THE best current franchise that‚Äôs ongoing in movies right now. 4-7 have just taken modern action movies to another level. And 1 and 3 are good movies in their own right! This was THE BEST ending to a Mission Impossible movie. That train sequence was so entertaining and enthralling.,2023-07-12 07:47:06
"The Mission Impossible franchise as whole truly puts the 007 franchise to shame. 

The action scenes are 100% the best out there. All of the first four movies has phenomenal action scenes. But the McQuarrie's last three (and four by the time Dead Reckoning 2 comes out) is head and shoulder above the first four. None of other spy related action movies even come close to it. 

Their treatment of female characters are very respectful. They don't objectify women. They all kick ass. Unlike 007 where they all end up James Bond's romantic interest. 

The sophistication of story-telling doesn't even come close to any other of spy based action movies. 

They're so good that it's shame that Tom Cruise is in his 60's. I'd LOVE to have several more Mission Impossible movies beyond the 8th one.",2023-07-12 07:53:07
"If I had a nickel for every movie this year with a car chase in Rome that involved a car driving backwards down some stairs, some one driving off a high place, a bad guy that sets bombs to finish off the hero, and that ended in a cliffhanger I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's still weird that it happened twice.",2023-07-12 08:10:45
"Haven‚Äôt gone to the movies since The Batman and Top Gun. Nothing I cared to watch at all. I live next door to the movie theater. NOTHING has made me want to walk a few steps outside and watch a movie. It‚Äôs all been drivel. BUT this! THIS IS CINEMA. This is why I love CINEMA! A good ass action film with none of the usual modern Hollywood bullshit! Never felt like a 3 hour film. I was just so hooked and engaged and grateful for every action set piece, every cool character, every time Tom Cruise is on screen giving all his TomCruissy & every time Hayley Atwell looked hot as fuck.

"Summers from here on out need movies like these. First Top Gun and now MI: Dead Reckoning. Tom Cruise has the formula to take the summer away from the MCU. He took Pom and Hayley from them too, and it was worth it.",2023-07-12 09:01:15
"Idk the ""the entity"" was too much of a shark jumping moment even and yes especially for a franchise like mission impossible. 

The charm to me personally has always been how ""real"" the movies felt while still being a movie. It's why Tom Cruise doing his own stunts is so damn special. For a good 90% of each movie elements are there to really absorb me and keep me, and to me that's largely due to the ""realism."" 

Call it nitpicky, I'll acknowledge that's what is, but every 10 minutes I kept asking myself how tf is this movie even happening? An AI that level could and would do hundreds of different things and Ethan Hunt and his team wouldn't even be able to blink in response. None of that is transferred into tension because they only use the power like what twice? It's an AI! Emotion wouldn't factor into anything. If it's so afraid of Ethan missile strike him and be done with it. 

Absolutely everything the team used should have been analog. Benji using a self driving car was laughable, and maybe I'm just salty, but Fast X was more believable. Just took me out of the movie way too many times. Like I get humans are useful to it, but why keep the one guy who knows what the key unlocks alive? Use literally any other person. It's an AI cockiness is not a reason. 

Sorry nitpicky rant over.",2023-07-12 09:05:48

That said, the plot is a bit goofy. The quick flashback had me thinking I‚Äôd missed a scene or villain in an early MI movie. The AI villain, while well done, always gets a bit of an eye roll from me. And I adore Rebecca Ferguson, so seeing her bow out was a bummer (though I thought they did a wonderful job foreshadowing it). 

Some of the set pieces were incredible. The airport scene felt straight out of MI1. The chase scene in Rome was funny and exhilarating. The club scene did a good job setting the stage. And the train stuff‚Ä¶ wooo.

"What I think some people might be overlooking about Ilsa's death is The Entity already knows who is going to die. The choice put to Ethan isn't real because he was never in position to make one. They sideline him while both women come to Gabriel, and if had wanted to kill Grace he had plenty of opportunity. So Ilsa's death was part of the plan, because as we learn later from Luther, her death could have knocked Ethan's focus off the mission and caused him to seek revenge. The Entity wants to protect itself and Ethan is the biggest threat. So by killing Ilsa it has the best chance of survival",2023-07-12 12:23:59

2. What is Gabriel's motivations to work for the AI? As he doesn't seem like the money type, and the AI was willing to let him die as well according to Luther.. and yet he had a backup plan (the truck).

"One thing that struck me watching it was how similar some of it was to *For Your Eyes Only* -- starts with a 'ship' sinking with a tech device on it that everyone wants which sends everyone on a wild goose chase after it. 

Bond / Hunt meets up with a mysterious but deadly woman and they escape in a car chase in a tiny yellow car used for comedy effect etc (this felt like an absolute nod to the iconic Bond chase.) 

There's even the motorcycle sequence that ends with a parachute jump off a cliff. 

But no talking parrot which conveniently drops some plot clues. Maybe in Part Two.",2023-07-13 06:25:56

Having said that, great music, great visuals, a bunch of great set pieces (that car chase, the sandstorm fight, the small alley way, the train!) great characters. 

Just a shame because of how tight of a movie Fallout was, this felt a bit sloppy, and I think the plot went 15% too stupid for some of my investment.",2023-07-13 06:54:21

"I have some gripes with this movie but it was still pretty good. Once again though, while the musical score is not bad, I didn't really care for it. It feels too Zimmer-lite to me and I'm tired of that sound. Giacchino's music was so much better.",2023-07-13 08:29:43
"I liked it. Not as airtight as the previous two entries but still darn good. Some thoughts in no particular order:

* Score was top-notch.

* Every character was utilized properly and some even get compelling character arcs. I bring this up specifically because previous films were more concerned with plot rather than with character development, which is fine but it's even better if you manage to have both. I'm impressed at how excellently they pulled that off considering how stacked the cast is. Everybody got to do something and just the right amount for each.

* Grace almost steals the entire movie. I thought she was just going to be another one-note femme fatale but her character has her own arc and development, even more so than Ethan. She's pretty much the co-protagonist of this film. And Hayley Atwell... *dang*. I didn't get it before, but boy do I get now.

* Wasn't too keen initially on the idea of an A.I. being the villain because we've seen it a thousand times before, but I did enjoy how paranoid it made things. I thought the line from the trailer ""truth is vanishing"" was just an empty phrase to generate hype, but they ended up integrating it into the plot quite neatly. Still feels like they could've done more with it, though. The climax of *Rogue Nation* was all about outsmarting your enemy. The climax of this one boils down to an action sequence (which is utterly incredible, granted) but not as much 4D chess. 

* Pacing was off at times, particularly during the first act. The Ilsa death fakeout wasn't necessary, especially when we saw her in future sequences in the trailer and they even reveal she's alive almost immediately after. Some exposition also could've been shaved off. There were moments when we the audience were being told information we had just heard from another character.

* Gabriel was all right, but that's because I liked Esai Morales' performance and not so much his writing. The way he's constructed as Ethan's nemesis because he killed someone we don't know and therefore don't care about from his past wasn't needed. It's just trying too hard to make me feel something by adding a tragic backstory *seven* installments into the franchise. Just stick to him killing Ilsa, that's all you need to have him be Ethan's target of rage. And even more importantly, ours.

* Ethan and Grace's train escape was outrageously intense. I loved it. I *knew* they wouldn't die, but I sure *felt* like they could. Just marvelous.

Overall, another hit in this saga. I'm excited for the next one.",2023-07-13 09:28:38
"Great movie, not as good as Fallout or Rogue Nation.

One thing that baffled me though is that they never explained why Grace didn't need colored contacts when she impersonated The White Widow, even her brother didn't notice.

Other than that, I can't wait for Part 2.",2023-07-13 11:48:54
"It's good yeah, but I honestly think that none of the Mission Impossible films are as lean and tight as Rogue Nation. The introduction of Ilsa, the full formation of the team, and every action scene pulled to its full potential and never overstaying its welcome.

Kittridge only saw her when she was little so it‚Äôs logical that he doesn‚Äôt remember the color of her eyes, but her own brother looking her in the eyes and not making that something was off?

The last third:  Fun, but not as fun as the first.  The drama IN the train was interesting, but the parts with Benji trying to get Ethan onto the train didn't feel like they had any stakes. Their dialogue was amusing, but neither felt in any immediate danger, and the big stunt didn't feel all that important.

Overall I felt it was entertaining, but for me it was no Ghost Protocol or Rogue Nation.  So many scenes felt like callbacks to the first Mission Impossible film.

Also, strangely, many scenes paralleled Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.",2023-07-13 18:56:09

Dead reckoning does better but the argument of ""AI can't hack analogue electronics"" is just dumb.  And really with the premise of this movie all forms of analogue technology is in danger. 

What's the solution? I don't find many people tackling this problem at the moment but firstly encryption. Standard encryption built off the RSA/AES model is pretty safe. If AI got access to all the classical computing capability in the world currently then, yes it can hack secure systems but it isn't fast it takes longer than the runtime of these films together.  QC, alright. AES/RSA is broken and then you have SVP. 

All they need to say in the film is ""we are using falcon encryption"", and they can still use their high tech gadgetry",2023-07-13 23:29:07

Unsure of his motivations, is he even human? Just not sure what the helmet thing was all about yet. They have flashbacks of him but my thoughts are the entity knew Ethan would be the one coming for it. So it created Gabriel to stop him.

"Was Ethan being tested by the villain in MI: Dead Reckoning

Was the AI entity testing ethan?

I think AI entity is not a villain.

What if the AI was actually following its programming ‚Äú to protect earth‚Äù or something of the sorts.

The AI must have come to the conclusion that not one single superpower nation can be trusted with its overwhelming power, whether it be the US government or Russian.
The AI did not go rogue as US government suspects.

The AI entity with its access to the secret files of IMF and other organisations predicted Ethan hunt to be the best choice in handing over its control and responsible use.

The AI entity wasn‚Äôt sure of its choice even with its 99% prediction algorithms so it decided to test Ethan.

The AI entity gave pseudo control to a random villain from Ethan‚Äôs past to see how Ethan would behave against someone who took everything away from him. 

Would Ethan let person vengeance overcome the mission or would he let the dutiful mission take priority, in the movie Ethan let his personal vengeance take control over him as he almost killed Gabriel and let it jeopardise the mission, so did Ethan fail in the eyes of AI? 

If there were no responsible inheritors for AI entity‚Äôs safe keeping it would probably need to self destruct as to make sure no wrong organisation gains control of it and it‚Äôs power.

But this choice would be a waste as US government will build a new one in a few years so it can‚Äôt leave humanity with the risk of another AI actually going rogue.

The vague introduction of Gabriel, a random villain from Ethan‚Äôs past is what making me believe this theory as the writers had no reason to make the overall plot of mission impossible franchise weak by introducing a random and forced villain from Ethan‚Äôs past unless the AI entity required Gabriel to test Ethan‚Äôs priorities.",2023-07-14 13:59:08

The thing about the Entity's predictions, which were apparently all based on 100% probability/likelihood, and Gabriel random takes on someone in the room was ... ok. It kind of bordered on the spirale of self-fulfilling prophecies here and there. Kind of expected Gabriel to go ""ha, jinxed it, no taksies backsies!"" at some points.

The romantic blue balls with Ilsa, what were they for? Also Ilsa being in the midst of it all again showed that MI is a fun action thriller franchise of epic proportions... with fun gadgets and lots of awesome stuff. But not drama or ... rich and good deep character building. Because if it were, how sad and one-dimensional would their lives be, right? While life happened elsewhere, Ethan chilled in empty lofts, warehouses, Ilsa also said bye but then, she just bounced and did her thing but kind of popped back in because of the AI(tm) problem? Like, do they simply not ... you know, fuck with other people? Or do they go on a literal dry spell for months, years and then FUCKING RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER IN THE FUCKING DESERT because of morse signaling? Whatever. It was fine. But Ilsa could have gotten around in full this time. Or not, but unfortunately she got too edgy against the dark machine lord.

The panicky circle spinning with the yellow gadget car was hilarious. And so many other scenes as well. The team's chemistry is really good.

The only thing I know is that both halves were on the sub at the beginning and with Ethan at the end. Some things I kind of remember...

I think Denlinger said the bodies were retrieved from the ice, so at least they mentioned how the halves were around in the first place. There was something about Ilsa getting her half in Istanbul. I have no idea who the dude in Abu Dhabi was, other than they thought he had what I guess was the other half. What's really throwing me off is something Luther said about that one being the wrong alloy and a fake. If it was fake, how did it have the radioactive signature? Regardless, I remember Grace left the airport having taken one from Ethan when he was distracted by Benji and the bomb. Was that not the one from the airport guy, but actually Ilsa's half that I guess Ethan had on him, and was that the only reason for the whole airport shenanigans, because the other half was already in their possession? I guess them being Alanna? They didn't get their hands on this other half because Grace gave it to the middle-aged dude on the plane, then (not shown) met up with him after escaping. At the party Grace put a half in Zola's pocket, then took it back. She had it when Gabriel fought her and then Ilsa, and I was thinking why didn't he take it from her? Did she run off during the fight and hide, then come back when she saw Ethan arrive or did Gabirel have a reason to leave it so that the train events as predicted by The Entity could happen? I can't even remember where and how both halves came together, but at the end Kittridge finalized buying the whole thing from Grace (as Alanna), then Grace took it back again. She had it when Ethan crash landed in the train car, it got knocked around, Gabriel took it, and Ethan got it back during their fight.

Sorry that was a lot of rambling I know, but if anyone has a full accounting of both halves throughout the film, I'd love to see it. Thanks!

P.S. Loved the movie. Can't wait to see it again, but that won't be till it's on Blu-ray.",2023-07-18 20:00:05
"I am confused about the scene of Denlinger (Cary Elwes) and Gabriel meet up. Since he is the only one who know everything about the entity and the submarine, plus eventually he will get the key (as he says the key exchange is under progress), certainly he can do whatever he want afterward. It seems like there is no benefit to meet Gabriel, who is the Entity messenger

does anyone have clue that what is the purpose of this meet up?",2023-07-18 21:24:23

"I've never had more to say about a movie than this one.
It was certainly not a Mission Impossible movie; it was John Wick meets Fast & Furious meets Writer's Strike Action writing. As this is a two parter (formerly the ending of the series), the stakes are null in that you know more is coming. Everything this movie does is not a black & white ""it did this bad, BUT it did this good,"" nor was it a failure of an execution of an idea,
‚Ä¢ nor was it ""nearly there."" The dialogue was either superficial or too much expositional tell, don't show.
The movie itself was too loud, and it used so much music instead of dialogue I couldnt help but think it was over or that we had reached a stopping point or as an audience member I had to care more or less than I did at the moment. The villains were too villainy.
Scenes were too long, while others appropriately I edited stuff we didnt need to see in a single shot: however, the camera work, while steady, was ""I just completed my first year in Film school"" bad. Our I protagonists were heavily protected by plot & perspective necessity. Points for practical effects &
‚Ä¢ stunts, as this attempted to keep me immersed; ‚Ä¢ would've been successful had it not been for the rest I of the movie's qualities & decisions. Hayley & Pom ( stole the show, as the story was leveraged through the former's perspective.

Having an AI villain is a double edged sword because it has all the powers a normal human shouldn't and plot holes because of human behavior/error are unacceptable.. If it was so scared of the Sevastopol sub then why didn't gabriel obtain one half of the key and destroy it instantly to lock out all the interested parties? He could have done that after killing Ilsa and knocking out Grace and searching her but nope! He just left her there WITH THE KEY! It banked on human emotions which is extremely unreliable. It was counting on grace being a greedy person to sell the key and unite the two halves.,2023-07-19 04:26:14

I enjoyed it. The plot reminded me a lot of Daemon and Person of Interest. Although I like Person of Interests take on representing an AI better.

what would be some questions you would ask if this movie was the subject of a podcast conversation,2023-08-06 23:16:32
"Some rougue AI was the logical conclusion to the ever increasing threat level of villains, I mean what can top off an entity that knows and controls anything digital? Unfortunately the execution of AI was flat, You have something that can control all electronics, infrastructure, traffic etc but it seems to operate mostly through a guy and his henchwoman? It should have been the case where Ethan cant get any tech support because it can get hacked, go anywhere near cctv because he will be identified etc. In the end we got a villain that sometimes decides to hack comms. I understand that premise is mostly to make a villain scary and that the plot will be bent more towards entertainment but i think it was too much for my sense of disbelief  


They should have given a handicap to the AI, maybe give a timer until it gets access to nukes so IMF has to race against time. Or make AI like Ultron, robot with a character who may not do most efficient or logical step for personal amusement",2023-08-11 15:36:16

"Overall, I really liked the movie, but one small thing that really annoyed me was in the beginning when every member of that Russian military sub was speaking English to each other. Have the actors all speak Russian ffs! They‚Äôre supposed to Russians! Just lazy",2023-08-13 04:18:51
"The film is a real thrill, and it draws me on. I could not stop thinking about it even now, which is a month after I have watched it. I think that it is one of, if not the best, of the Mission Impossible movies, yet. Frankly at one point I was even confused about the whereabouts of the key until one of the users here helped me clear the clues, thanks.

However I feel the urge to say that in my opinion there is one flaw in the story which should be addressed, namely, that the ending where Ethan appears to gain the upper hand and to have eluded Gabriel and the Entity somewhat undermines the impression of an all-powerful intelligence established by the beginning of the film. I could think of two possibilities which might explain the fact that Ethan got the keys by the end, 

1. The Entity never intended that Gabriel should possess them, and instead has a plan which it hides even from Gabriel, in which case the menacing sensation given by the union of the Entity and Gabriel would be diminished;
2. Ilsa is still alive in secret unbeknownst to the Entity, therefore resulting in an error in its calculations, in which case the immensity of the Entity' intellect would be diminished.

Either case, the threat posed by the villains of the film, which should take two parts instead of one to resolve, would be somewhat compromised; personally speaking, I would have expected Ethan's team to be outsmarted and overwhelmed by defeat by the end of Part One, which seems to be within the capability of the Entity, who, as Gabriel has put, ""subtly manipulating the minds of billions,"" and therefore should have dwarfed Ethan's intellect, which, as powerful as it is, is after all only a human intellect and not as unfathomable as that of the Entity. Part One should serve as a learning opportunity for Ethan's team to discover some sort of Achilles' heel of the Entity and Gabriel, but I would think that the exploit of the said heel should transpire in an unexpected manner in Part Two instead.

But these are just my personal opinions, and some of my interpretations could very well be wrong.",2023-08-20 17:10:03

I am all in on the ""Ilsa is still alive"" theory because otherwise they just killed her off super fast and dirty.  Luther telling Grace ""she's the reason you're still alive"" was also a fun wordplay that makes me think they somehow faked something.  Maybe someone else was wearing an Ilsa mask with the magical mask making machine? Had her organs moved to the right side right before the fight? MI has had all sorts of wild ways to get around these things before, wouldn't surprise me now if they could fake it.",2023-08-28 18:49:11

"I actually think the AI has gained sentient, and after hacking every major organization and learning everything about humanity, it actually realizes that it must be destroyed because it will be end of the world if anyone or any country gain control of it. That's why I actually think everything the AI is doing is actually trying to lead ethan to its core source code so ethan can destroy it. 

For example, what Gabriel did yo tip.of Pom makes no sense, it's as if they wanted POM to turn to ethan. 

Also, the AI could have Ethan eliminated multiple times, why leave him alive. Also, if the AI is trying to avoid being controlled or destroyed, then destroy the key or leave it undiscovered is much better than sending Gabriel. 

So I think the AI will actually be revealed at the end to be seeking self destruction and it knows ethan is the obey oen that wants to destroy it instead of controlling it.",2023-08-29 04:42:13

"In a show called Person of Interest, I remember one episode where some main characters got killed off one by one by the bad guys, only that they were simulations done by an AI, calculating the optimal route of escape for said characters. iirc The episode in the later part featured a few more different simulations wherein they're still getting killed off with no favourable outcome. These said simulations were but happening in some few seconds if not milliseconds. With that being said, it came off as a shock at first that some well liked characters got killed before knowing that it was actually a simulation.

I wonder if the second part of death reckoning is gonna be taking this approach. The first part, from a certain point became a simulation run by the AI and would lead to Hunt's team's victory in the second part. The second part would see the return of Ilsa and do an explanation montage of how it was all actually a simulation only for the AI to conclude that the simulation was only the best possible outcome for the bad guys' team for them to get as close to winning but still ended up losing to Hunt's team.

This would be a bad approach imo.",2023-09-07 07:12:35

"There's no way Ilsa is actually dead, is my theory. I'm sure someone else brought this up, but isn't a main plot point of MI 1 that someone faked their death...on a bridge?


He tells her to ""stay dead,"" and  to ""run as far as you can"" earlier in the movie. They carefully avoid all details of her death afterwards, and she's very obtusely grieved for a short period of time with no mention of it later, even when the other characters mention it and grieve openly (Grace). The same way he avoided it when they faked Julia's death, and she was mentioned directly by other characters in Ghost Protocol (Jane).


What better way to trick the entity than by allowing it to believe something happened that didn't? You're telling me the key to its entire plan was the death of one of the women, and it just...happened? 


We know Grace isn't aware, but Luther likely is, since he's going off grid to work out the bits of the entity's code, somewhere where the entity can't find him. A perfect place to rendezvous with another person who doesn't wish to be seen by an all-calculating digital enemy. I imagine both will show up together three quarters of the way through the second movie.

1. The exposition dump at the start in the office before Ethan reveals himself was ridiculous.

We good?‚Äù.

2. Why does Ethan care about Grace other than the key? She‚Äôs nothing to him other than someone he‚Äôs helped out. Yes he‚Äôs a good person overall but the lengths he goes to to make sure she‚Äôs ok over others is bizarre. 

3. I‚Äôm bored of maguffins in films. The key. THE KEY!!! She has it, they have it, they don‚Äôt have it, now I‚Äôve got it, now you‚Äôve got it! If this AI so all encompassing then why can‚Äôt it just print out the key for its ‚Äòmessiah‚Äô? 

4. So Gabriel not only perfectly timed Ethan from being stopped from slitting his throat, him standing up and the truck being in place, he also was able to perfectly fall into said truck without an issue?!

"I was thinking that until she started fighting, especially in that alley scene with Hunt. The way she was screeching as she swung the pipe felt extremely Mantis-like.

"I feel like that bike jump fell a tad flat mainly due to how much CGI is needed(understably) to cover up the ramp and even replace the bike wheels to add little bumps in the suspension. Same goes for the train which was real, the water it crashes into is CGI or heavily adjusted in comp.

&#x200B;

Still absolutely loved the sequence.",2023-07-12 14:37:59
Especially the escape from the falling train cars. My god was that perfect,2023-07-13 04:49:58
"I went into the movie blind and the bike jump was fucking breathtaking, mostly because I knew that was Tom Cruise actually doing that shit",2023-07-12 11:10:43
"The crazy thing to me was that the bike jump off the cliff almost felt incidental in the end. It was an awesome stunt but between the hype it‚Äôs received, and how invested I was in what was happening on the train, it felt like they just threw it in for the heck of it.

To be clear, I mean this as a compliment. They need to find a way to get Ethan on the train so achieve that simple narrative task via one of the best stunts ever. Loved it.",2023-07-12 16:41:17
"The train sequence was a million times better imo. Not to take away from how much balls Cruise has to have in order to do that stunt irl, but I saw it enough times in previews to become pretty numb to the thrill of it and realize that all it is is base jumping. He just jumped off a cliff and parachuted to his location. Anybody can do that while on vacation. Nerve wracking, but not exactly as big a thrilling action sequence as say, holding onto a plane as it takes off. Or climbing and leaping from car to car as a train slowly tumbles off a blown up bridge. That's way too rad to do on vacay",2023-07-12 05:29:54

There were a few moments through that train sequence that immediately transported me to uncharted 2.,2023-07-16 07:22:34
The bike jump just wasn't thrilling. Not sure if it's because we got to see it so many times in the behind the scenes or because of poor editing (cannot say if it even was poorly edited): but the behind the scenes footage felt much more enthralling to me. The train sequence was incredible and I'm glad I didn't get to see too much of that prior to catching this in theatres.,2023-07-12 14:32:26
"I honestly thought the bike jump was incredibly useless. Like, I was not impressed by it at all. The BTS of it was so incredible, but what made it into the film didn‚Äôt feel worthwhile. 

But you‚Äôre right, the train sequence, especially the very last part, was breathtaking.",2023-07-12 20:50:26
I think the train sequence might be my favorite stunt sequence from the entire series. It was awesome. And I'm so grateful that I knew nothing about it going in.,2023-07-15 07:23:14

"Bro, I almost wanted to play Uncharted 2 again after watching that.",2023-07-18 04:49:37
I honestly didn't love either sequence. Bike jump sequence was too short and the cgi ramp cover was obvious. Train sequence was obviously mostly cg and a lot of it was not very well done cg.,2023-07-14 06:14:45

"The bike jump was fine although it was hyped so much and shown so many times in the ads it was a bit underwhelming. It kinda shows how real life is less interesting than Hollywood effects. It was‚Ä¶ fine. 

The train sequence was not really that special since I‚Äôve basically seen that exact same scenario played out in multiple media franchises already: Uncharted 2 Among Thieves game from 2010, and the Tomb Raider movie in 2018. After a while it‚Äôs kinda uninteresting to see the same scenario play out with minor differences.",2023-10-13 12:42:08

"I'm late to this thread but it annoyed me how Ethan (and Grace) got extremely lucky not once but twice, by landing exactly in the wagon saving the life of Grace, and then the second time when his parachute caught wind and made him knock out the second guy. It's not like he could possibly see well inside the rapidly-moving train and pick where he would enter, all this going fast enough side way to break the window.

Like, is this guy Jar Jar Hunt?",2024-03-03 16:33:34

"For 3., I liked the abrupt cuts to the dirt bike. They were hilarious. Not sure if that‚Äôs the intention or not, but yeah I lol‚Äôd at a couple. 

Especially loved Ethan being like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be there!‚Äù, then some tense convo in between, and then the next scene is just, ‚Äú-I missed the train!‚Äù I just liked that we were expecting him to do something crazy to subvert Gabriel‚Äôs move, but the movie was like, ‚Äúnah not yet, baby.‚Äù It was like comedic build up to a crazy stunt.

"Because this comment is a month old and I don't see anyone else posting about it. The thing that really ticked me off is how impossible it is to lose a fight with a sword vs a switch blade. You just have too much range and you can't block a bladed weapon. It's like bringing a sword to a gun fight and Indiana jones set up the precedent for how that goes. But you can do things to justify it. Like you could have Gabriel wearing some cut resistant gloves or pull out some gadgety expanding baton. Or, you know, don't give her a sword? Have it be a blunted weapon or a taser. Have him throw the fucking knife opening up a vulnerability which he can use to wrestle the sword away from her. asfjlkjas",2023-08-18 23:12:14

The other key moment I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of was Ilsa‚Äôs death it sort of just came and went, and I know these films drive forward and that‚Äôs kind of the appeal of them. But it just seemed to serve to launch Grace in as her replacement and then that‚Äôs that. 

With Rebecca Ferguson (beside Monaghan) being the first actress to actually appear in more than 2 of these consecutively - Kirby soon to join the club - it feels strange to kill her off seemingly to make room for someone new.

">My biggest issue is Gabriel.

I am kind of disappointed they showed Ethan drawing blood from his throat, because I was honestly expecting it to be something totally wild like Gabriel is an android piloted by the Entity. I feel like that's something that's perfectly within reason in the Mission Impossible world, especially since there's been realistic face mask technology for decades. Unless the android is down to like Cylon-level realism, which seems like it would be a touch too far imo.

But I have fully bought into the power level they've given to the Entity, and I'm surprised they didn't have more examples of its potential. They describe it being capable of a lot of things, but the most impressive thing it does onscreen (aside from have a team of mercenaries doing its bidding) is probably the opening scene. I wanted to see it do something really unbelievable and dramatic, like launch some nukes or something. I don't feel thoroughly pulled towards the next movie as much as I'm just glad they're going to keep making these.",2023-07-16 00:07:12

I think they were trying to show that there is a relationship there without over-doing it. Otherwise you risk a case of Skywalker Syndrome where the fate of the world comes down to a small group of people and their interpersonal relationships. Or the ridiculous decision to make James Bond and Ernst Stavro Blofeld long-lost adoptive brothers in *Spectre*. I suppose you can argue that >!the Entity knew who Ethan was and sought out Gabriel to be its agent as he is someone who could get under Ethan's skin (which would explain why it didn't tell Gabriel what the key opened),!< but I don't think it's fair to criticise them for only introducing Gabriel as someone from Ethan's past seven films in.

Gabriel is a cool character, but his development? Saved for Part Two. The AI‚Äôs motivations is intriguing, but what is the motivation? Part Two. Ethan‚Äôs new shadowy past before the IMF? Learn about it in Part Two.

Cruise and McQ are far too competent to make such an absolutely nonsensical decision. The only possible reason is her wanting out or scheduling issues with Dune and Silo S2 or a fakeout which I‚Äôd love to see be the case.

"With all the stop and starts during production, including the Covid pandemic during the middle of shooting, I think it‚Äôs clear they had to get her character out of the movie due to scheduling/outside conflicts.

This movie feels like a Rollercoaster ride and not in a bad way. You can look at a rollercoaster, see the loops and turns but it doesn't diminish the enjoyment of actually riding it.

It's why they can practically put a mini trailer in the opening sequence and it doesn't ruin anything. It's so confident in its spectacle to wow you and there not wrong.",2023-07-16 05:01:21

Nah she's for real dead. They spent the whole first half of the movie foreshadowing her death and it really informs Ethan's character for the rest of the movie.

Conveniently, he‚Äôs also the one who killed her, so the one man the entity trusts is now 100% sure she‚Äôs dead. Add to that the fact that they barely even gave us, or the characters, time to grieve, and it seems almost guaranteed that she‚Äôs still alive. If she really is dead, fuuuuuuuuuuuck that. She isn‚Äôt though. Oh yeah, and they made it clear Luther was going into hiding too, so going off the grid is clearly a part of the strategy here.",2023-07-12 15:34:25
Agreed. The fake-out death before her real one 20 mins later felt half-baked and was the worst part of the movie for me,2023-07-12 20:59:10
"I'm not convinced she's dead, otherwise it was unusually badly written for a (recent) MI movie.

They fake her death and she's supposed to go in to hiding from everyone (perfect way to write Ferguson out if she's busy) and she just randomly turns up in Rome with the crew? Says barely anything, has barely a plot, loses a fight she would normally win, and nobody is that even that sad! 

How did she know they were in Rome? Surely Ethan wouldn't have contacted her with the movie's big 'protect my friends' through-line. Has she been found by The Entity and blackmailed into working with Gabriel, or working for The Entity without anyone's knowledge (very Ilsa)? She could definitely fake her death against the IMF since even in just this movie they apparently put no effort in checking if people still have a pulse!",2023-07-12 22:03:03
"My biggest gripe with the film. I thought Ilsa was end game. Not even from a fan perspective but from a writing one as well. It's sad that Ethan wasn't able to end up with Julia because of the nature of his work. Ilsa *is* from this line of work and they clearly liked each other. I felt like she was truly the one he'd end up with after he retires. 

&#x200B;

The scene before they go to the Entities party is them realizing that they‚Äôre all there because the Entity has ordained this entire scenario and wants to kill someone close to Ethan. Idk that Ilsa would go with Ethan to the party knowing this information and not taking some preventive measures in case something went wrong.",2023-07-15 19:13:11
"After a second viewing, I'm 1000% convinced she survived. It makes so much sense structurally. The first fake death plays out in a way that feels to me like it's setting up the big reveal in M:I8, Luther behaves bizarrely following the ""real"" death, and the death occurs in a similar setting to where Phelps faked his death in M:I1. Paris survives a similar stab wound, the line at the start of the Venice sequence that ""nothing outside this room is real"", etc. Seems like a creative workaround for her scheduling conflicts and hopefully she'll get a few big moments in Part 2.

Just to elaborate further about the prologue, Ilsa's fake death doesn't feel intended to be suspenseful (although the preceding action scene certainly is), it feels intended as exposition to teach us that this is a stratagem Ethan & Ilsa would employ. (The focus on Ethan's line ""you're dead. You stay dead"")",2023-07-19 03:52:32

"I found it very boring. Way too long, some scenes artificially extended by long pauses to impress on us how serious everything is. Almost 3h for just a part one, meh. Plus i really don't think a 2 parter works for Mission Impossible. Most of the stakes seemed flat because i knew there was a second part, so i knew they had to get the key at the end of the movie. Everything felt very predictable (not saying that to boast, i was disappointed) and ""calibrated"" (the introduction of Hatwell's character to replace Ferguson's, for example). I really liked the previous Mc Quarrie ones but this one felt so calibrated and flat.


Edit : also one of my big complains about this movie is that everything is too clean. Looked like the freaking Superbowl Tide add. Hatwell's character has to duck in coal near the end and in the next scenes she's completely clean. The bad guy looks like a model going to a photoshoot in all his scenes. The previous ones felt more real in that regard.",2023-07-14 17:45:53
"I agree with most of this, especially about the villain. I would have preferred to see the original choice of Nicholas Hoult instead. He can play a desperation that would have gone over well here imo. For being a part one, this is a very strong film in its own right.",2023-07-12 22:11:09
I'm weird in that my favorite is still the original. It just has the classic spy movie vibe none of the others do.,2023-07-14 22:02:24
I still think Cavill‚Äôs performance in Fallout is one of the best he‚Äôs ever done. Cavill‚Äôs a genuine menace in that one and I couldn‚Äôt wait to see him get got.,2023-07-18 17:42:51
"I feel weird saying this cause I give Fallout a 9/10

So keep in mind, I love the movie. But I don‚Äôt get the hype with John Lark as a villain. He‚Äôs a great physical threat. But by far not the best villain of the franchise. That would go to Solomon Lane or Owen Davian 

While those two are also better than Gabriel, I think Gabriel is more intimidating than Cavil. 

We obviously need more character development for Gabriel but I actually feared for peoples lives with his scenes. With Cavil I feared he‚Äôd punch someone but he didn‚Äôt seem like a scary negotiator like Lane was. Cavil was still great. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs just the this motives were the amazing same as Lane‚Äôs. He‚Äôs Lane‚Äôs sidekick. So he doesn‚Äôt feel like his own villain.

In that way I definitely think Gabriel is better 

I‚Äôd say Fallout is McQuarrie‚Äôs weakest entry. STILL amazing. I don‚Äôt want to be a contrarian. Like I‚Äôve tried so many times to appreciate Fallout as much as some fans. But I just don‚Äôt fully get why people think it‚Äôs the best. My comment is kinda dumb because keep in mind I LOVE fallout lmao. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve always preferred Rogue Nation. It does everything better imo. 

So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm trashing Fallout, it‚Äôs more that for me it‚Äôs a 9/10 and I don‚Äôt fully get people giving it a 10/10 if that makes sense 

And the reason I‚Äôd also give Dead Reckoning the edge over of Fallout is that it felt both like Rogue Nation and the first movie. And the first movie is just so special to me. I‚Äôm a new fan. I watched all 6 movies for the first time this past September lol. And the first movie holds a special place in my heart because I didn‚Äôt know ANY of the twists going in. The only thing I knew was the iconic hanging from a rope scene. My dad had always told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt watch mission impossible, it sucks. I fell asleep during the first movie. It can‚Äôt live up to the tv show‚Äù. So I avoided it my whole life. When I finally watched the first one and saw Ethan‚Äôs whole team die, thats when I went ‚Äúso THIS is what I‚Äôve been missing out on‚Äù. My mind was blown. And be rest of the movie was a wild ride.

So while I love MI:3 and Ghost Protocol, MI:1 and Rogue Nation are my two favourites. And thats why I guess I loved Dead Reckoning way more than a lot of people in this comment section. To me the call backs weren‚Äôt nostalgic, because I‚Äôve only been a fan for 6 months. But more, it reminded me why I became a fan. 

Sorry for the rant",2023-07-12 12:43:33

I actually liked the decision to kill ilsa which is wild because she was one of my favorites going in. I thought it solidified the idea from Fallout and MI:3 that being that close to Ethan puts you in major danger. A similar idea is mentioned by Kittridge at the end about Grace,2023-07-12 02:56:17

Her character was tied to Lane in the previous two films. There was really nowhere else to go with her. Just my opinion,2023-07-29 23:41:32
It‚Äôs really hard to top Fallout. That‚Äôs a masterpiece & one of the best action films I‚Äôve seen in the last several years. This is a solid entry but Fallout is my favorite.,2023-07-12 02:21:56
"Yeah this kicked ass.

"Fallout is just banger after banger after banger. It‚Äôs pretty ridiculous how every action scene in that film is as good as it could be, whether it‚Äôs the HALO jump, bathroom brawl, Paris chase, helicopter chase, etc.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the action in this film is, of course, great. But Fallout is better paced so Ôøºit felt like we were constantly getting pummeled with some of the most intense action on film.

Whereas I can only remember three set pieces from Part One; Rome chase, Venice fight, basejump/train. And unlike Fallout where *every* setpiece blows our mind, the train sequence is the only one where I went ‚ÄúHoly fucking shit.‚Äù Rome and Venice were intense but nothing too crazy. Just wildly entertaining. And in between the action in this film is a whole lot of setup and no resolution until Part Two.

In the end, it‚Äôs hard to judge this one with Fallout because Fallout was a complete story and resolution whereas this story is obviously not yet complete.

I‚Äôm very ready for Part Two and I hope some theaters screen both back to back for a complete picture.",2023-07-13 13:36:20

I feel the same way. I think her character has so much more to explore and I am truly hoping that it's a fakeout.,2023-07-12 03:32:32
"They've really dug themselves into a hole.

Right then and there Benji and Luther should have decided to unplug EVERYTHING. Or at the very least it should have been done after the airport scene. It would have been cool to watch the team work through limitations of a lack of technology to walk them through everything. Would have been fun having them use analogue spycraft shit like dead drops and hand signals, etc for a mission.

The fact that even after the thing literally invades Ethan's comms and misdirects him, Benji is STILL on a laptop, using gps, and trusting bmw to self drive itself with a car that I assume connects to the net and gps systems is super silly.",2023-07-17 14:32:33

"I assumed the worst when I started noticing at the early Venice scenes just how little she actually is in the movie, and how even when she is there she doesn't have much to say. Combine that with the actress starring in her own TV show and they were probably struggling to find a way to give her an exit after establishing her as the primary ally to Ethan in the past two movies, the end of Fallout established that they are together for good rather than her only being there for the Syndicate story, with how good their chemistry was and how they are both experienced members of the spy world, but scheduling issues had them press a big undo button.

Uhh what? They spent the whole first half of the film foreshadowing her death. The previous scene in the club they litterally said one of them will die.

"Wouldn't say it was completely random but it felt a little rushed yeah, not given the full build up/weight. She barely spoke between the club to her death. And she got bested what seems way too easily when we saw over 2 movies how fully capable she is. At least give her a few hired goons to take on first!

Partly also didn't think the villian to take her out was that good per se. Out of the MI villians he's, so far, more a Mi 2 or 4 blandness instead of a 3, 5, 4, 1 impact/acting wise even with that added backstory..sorry Esai Morales. Probably will be better in part 2.

Sad to see her leave. But that's just like my opinion, man.",2023-07-12 07:44:38

Dude I have bigger questions. Like where exactly did the key go from where to where?,2023-07-12 18:40:35
"Yeah it really felt like a slap in the face to everything they built‚Ä¶. Out with the old, in with the new? Also what‚Äôs the point of the first fake out if she was only going to be in like 6 minutes of the movie and to die like that. We‚Äôve watched her kill two top spies in the last 2 movies so it felt really anti climactic and just a waste of a great character.",2023-07-16 19:20:50
"Yeah I didn‚Äôt like that either, like anyone with a sword knows to keep your distance and use the reach, she was using the sword like a knife",2023-07-19 03:15:15
"> I felt like Ilsa's death was random and out of blue? Like, I felt confusion rather than sadness. Wtf?

I just saw this movie with a friend and he was making fun of her after the movie saying he could have done better given that the sword would have had much better reach than the knife.",2023-07-24 05:21:54
I don‚Äôt get that complaint. They definitely set it up for one the gals to die and I‚Äôm sure most people knew who it was going to be. Now they way they handled her death was pretty terrible. The quick cut away from her to Ethan‚Äôs slow revelation just killed all the emotion.,2023-07-12 03:57:10
Aging is a motherfucker.,2024-03-17 16:22:00
I didn't think it was rushed. It was hinted throughout before the club scene but after she returned to Rome.,2023-07-12 04:07:57
"I saw it coming. She barely had much screen time in first half, and with us already knowing this was going to be a cliff hanger going into the movie, someone was bound to die. And sad as it was, she was the obvious choice. 
Haley is new blood and well freaking gorgeous in this movie, so they weren‚Äôt going to off her.",2023-07-12 04:52:25
"i actually wouldnt have minded if she did really just bite it in the desert.  i think shes in too many movies and her relationship with Ethan makes it hard for her to be one of the 'Boys.  if his reaction to her dying then was as genuine as how he acted, then it wouldnt have made a difference to the story

bringing her back in to take her out simultaneously made her overstayed and pointlessly short, if anyone gets my meaning

i dont think Ethan needs to hate Gabe more, seems like hes got that down anway",2023-07-12 06:39:37
"I think that‚Äôs how people should go out, as often as not. I think the most tropey way to go about it would be for her to severely wound the guy, then she gets killed, and the bad guy limps away, and she says her last words to Ethan before croaking out a death rattle and shuffling off her mortal coil. And then Ethan‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúKHAAAAAAAANNN!!!‚Äù That would fucking *suck*.

Anyway, not all deaths have to be at the climax of a film. In fact, it‚Äôs probably better when they‚Äôre not. I think there‚Äôs still a third of Speed left when Jeff Daniels buys it, and that‚Äôs as out of the blue as it gets. At least she doesn‚Äôt get it as bad as the girls from the second or the last Rambo pictures. Their deaths are just casual plot points, written solely drive men to revenge. In this case, Ilsa makes a good show of it, but ultimately the other guy is just better. It‚Äôs fine.",2023-07-12 04:08:05
I mean in the movie they predicted a 50% chance for her death. So it was not out of the blue.,2023-07-12 06:50:48
It didn‚Äôt feel out of the blue for me but the build up for it in the club was unnecessary for me. Would have been fine if Ilsa just stepped in at that time as she was chasing Grace too.,2023-07-16 04:27:59
I don't think she'll be back. They already psyched the audience out by making us think she died in the beginning of the movie.,2023-07-12 03:52:56
"It would be a surprise if she came back because the first film is one of the scenarios The Entity plays out trying to make sure it comes out on top, so Pt 2 will be the actual conclusion with Ilsa still alive, but then we're gonna lose someone else then, probably Ethan ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2023-07-12 08:05:06
They spent the whole movie foreshadowing her death. How was it out of the blue lmao,2023-07-12 12:27:55
Two fakeout deaths would be lame.,2023-07-13 12:08:07
That's life. And that's why the death was painful for me.,2023-07-14 08:23:24
"Yeah, i suppose it made sense within the movie's logic (the entity needed Gabriel to kill someone *else* Ethan loved? I guess?) but I don't understand the logic of making that the logic of the movie. She's been an essential part of the past few movies, and I had a hard time getting hyped about Hayley Atwell (despite her great performance) because she felt like a shooed-in replacement for Ilsa",2023-07-14 17:33:33
It's enough of a feat she got 2 let alone 3 movies before Ethan got bored of her.,2023-07-15 13:02:40
As somebody who did not know this character beforehand it felt good to give the hero stakes but I understand you.,2023-07-20 21:48:31
"Im bummed she was killed off but im thinking it might have been done for the following reasons:

1. She might not actually be dead, and there is a long play at hand, but that is unlikely
2. She's a super popular/in demand actress, so im assuming Dune Part 2 and SILO made it is she couldn't really play a larger part",2023-07-14 22:52:03

She's clearly not a ""bond girl"" archetype, so I'm confused why everyone's so attached to her.",2023-07-16 05:44:01
"I know people miss Cruise bringing in different directors to change up the style of these movies with each entry but I feel McQuarrie just gets Tom Cruise and his film persona in a way that no other filmmaker does and is thus able to craft these movies accordingly.

"Totally agree.  I just don't understand the positive response the movie has been getting.  
I thought this was embarrassingly bad compared to Fallout.  

Glad you mentioned the fight choreography. 
I though that was all terrible as well.  Especially compared to all of the scenes in Fallout.

I can't believe how much weaker this film was on almost every level.

The plot of Dead Reckoning is trash.",2023-07-15 05:05:33

It‚Äôs not getting me hyped, it‚Äôs making me realize, yea this is a mission impossible movie and I‚Äôm seating in a theatre. 

And if their wasn‚Äôt any mission impossible theme playing it just felt like a standard action movies soundtrack. Completely forgettable and I could not hum you the tune even if their was a gun to my head.

(still could be a second faked death, I feel it would be a more brutal stabbing if she was 100% dead. But then again I don't see Gabriel being that incompetent)",2023-07-12 09:06:22
"The Sophie‚Äòs Choice scene really creaked when Gabriel had to throw in ‚Äûoh btw, Grace has the key and Ilsa doesn‚Äôt have shit, so maybe take that into account‚Äú to somehow try to balance the scale. 

And then it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway, because at no point does Ethan or anyone do any choosing? Gabriel says something like ‚ÄûI hoped it would be you‚Äú when Ilsa shows up, but mate. You could have just killed Grace. She‚Äôs just there and unconscious. Maybe that‚Äôs a point about determinism and free will that I am not really getting to? But that‚Äôs the whole film in a nutshell: The dialogue is complete hokum, but the design, the stunts and the physical performances (in that sequence mostly Cruise and Klementieff) are top notch.",2023-07-15 01:25:33

"Regarding the choice between Ilsa and Grace, I think the whole point there is that Ethan would never let any one die, he's going to try to do everything in his power to save every life, especially that of his teammates but also even a random stranger; remember how torn and broken he was when that random female police officer was gunned down in Fallout?  So when Grace later tells him ""you don't even know me, why would you want me to join you"", he replies ""Does it matter?""",2023-07-12 13:08:35

I think it was literally one train car too many. And to top it off with another one of Hunt's damsels saving him out the blue idk. But lame. It was a cool sequence tho.,2023-07-15 13:14:15
"> And three, I know Ethan cares about people in general, but Gabriel positing that Ethan would have to choose between Ilsa- someone who he‚Äôs had a history with for the past couple movies- and Grace- essentially a random pickpocket he met a day or two ago‚Ä¶ treating those potential deaths as emotionally equivalent struck me as odd, is all. Of course having to make an active choice to say kill Grace isn‚Äôt something Ethan would do, but it felt like the movie was treating it as some Sophie‚Äôs choice.

I said the same thing while talking to my friend afterward. I'm seeing it again tonight, so maybe my thoughts will change, but I just couldn't buy into this part of the story at all. I know Ethan doesn't want to lose *anyone* on these missions, but he and Ilsa have an implied sexual relationship. Grace is a pickpocket he just met and barely knows. They're not equivalent in any way.",2023-07-16 23:06:08

I joked with my friend next to me that there would be 3 more hours of this. Infinity train style. It never seemed to end. 

There were a number of moments in this film that dragged on 2x longer than they should have. Some speeches. Some shots. The car chase even felt too long? Why end the movie with the dramatic SLOW shot of the sub? We know it's there. We've already seen the shot. We're not dumb, we know where part 2 is going. Overall the movie was just too long.",2023-08-19 16:30:07

Movie felt a bit too campy even for them.  Everything is a wink.  It undercuts it.

Some lines were unnecessary like duh we get it.  I can't remember the specific line but it's from Vingh Rames and made me feel like ""yes you don't have to spell it out we get it.""

Also just so much damned exposition in general.  Every other scene is a context dump where they just stand around telling us the story.  Felt like just chaining action sequences together with expo.

He barely knows her.  Why care about her?

Her eyes are brown when the other woman has blue eyes.  Is that for our benefit? Like we're idiots?  Her bodyguard doesn't immediately recognize that?

Why do the Russians have to speak English with an accent and not just have Russian with subtitles?  It‚Äôs such a short scene too.  Is it maybe less impactful reading the reveal than hearing it?

Gabriel sucked as a villain and the shoehorned backstory is so forced and meaningless at this point in the series.

Quote from reddit: They should have picked either the Director of Intelligence or Kitrich to be on the train. Having both got slightly confusing in trying to understand who is on what side.""  We don't know if purposeful or not.

The true villain being ""The Entity"" just falls flat.  It sounds like they're talking about an alien.  Does everything have to be about AI now?

Cool action sequences as usual, but the overuse of CGI feels cheap.",2023-07-14 09:45:06

And yes, I agree, it's not as good or as tight as Fallout, as that film just builds and builds to a great crescendo.",2023-07-12 09:03:58

"The trailers have been a real problem for this one I feel. They've been in the cinemas for at least 14 months (since Top Gun: Maverick came out) and I must have seen the trailer at least 10 times. Which meant that the majority of the stunt sequences it was a case of watching waiting for them to get to the key scenes that are already burnt into my memory. The only actions sequence that felt relatively fresh was the airport stuff, as whilst there are a few shots of that in the trailer, I feel they didn't give away quite so much.

Based on my experience in theory I'd like to avoid the trailer for Part 2, but unless I disconnect from the internet and don't go to any movies in the next year, that's not going to be possible. The train/bike stunt for example, I can't imagine there's many people in the world who *haven't* seen clips of that by now.",2023-07-15 11:37:04

Cruise and McQ are far too competent to make such an absolutely nonsensical decision. The only possible reason is her wanting or scheduling issues with Dune and Silo S2 or a fakeout which I‚Äôd love to see be the case.

"She's currently on the list of actors for Part 2 on IMDB, but I have no idea how official that is. Although, it's pretty updated as Hannah Waddingham and Nick Offerman (who were confirmed to be in Part 2), are on that list.

My headcanon is that he's a new DNI installed by the President that was moved from some secret project that didn't tell the IC they attacked the *Sevastopol*, so he actually knows all about the IMF and the Entity but needs to play dumb in front of the mostly apolitical, career appointees of the IC. Because even *in this movie* the IMF is clearly an open thing in the intel community, the CIA mooks know all about how many times Ethan Hunt's gone rouge. The opening mission statement of the Secretary *disavowing* all knowledge only works if the Secretary could hypothetically avow any agents of the IMF, which is hard to do if it's so secret the DNI doesn't know!",2023-07-15 08:51:12

">One major criticism I have is that I feel the intro scene with the submarine should have been the intro to Part 2

I get your point but I think it was important for us to see what the entity is capable of before we start the movie. If you remove that scene, the intro is just Kittridge explaining AI which is a lame way to set up your villain. Watching the entity do it's thing sets the vibe of the movie and puts you in the right headspace when this turns into a paranoid thriller",2023-07-12 02:13:23
"> I loved that they brought back Czerny and shot that awesome scene where Ethan knocks out the meeting room of officials just to talk with him like a De Palma scene with all those dramatic angles.

That entire scene as soon as Hunt enters the room was gold.

When Gabriel possessed the keys, he had the perfect opportunity to discard them in any train-linking section.

Then, no one else could gain access to the source code, and as the entity is already disseminated throughout the cloud, it seems a logical solution.",2023-07-14 15:37:49

The one with Kittridge, Cary Elwes' character, and the rest of the intelligence leadership was especially hokey with everyone practically completing each other's sentences.

I've seen the video of them shooting on a real moving train, I know they did it for real, but then I'm looking at the background in many of those scenes and it looks fake. Maybe they replaced a lot of the background, similar to the Halo jump in the last one?
Also super odd for me, the music didn't really do it for me in this one. I'm quite a fan of Lorne and I think his work in the last one was outstanding, but here I just don't feel it.

">I've made a bet with friends that Part 2 will reveal that Part 1 was an AI simulation for the entity to learn more about Ethan. I'll probably lose, but damn I'll be happy if I end up just 5% right.

This is absolutely bonkers, just batshit insane.  I love it.  

Unfortunately, it's too weird and unconventional for Hollywood to do.  It's the biggest ""oh it was all a dream"" sort of move this franchise could possibly pull.  

Having said that, I think everything being slow and stable with Gabriel and more choppy with everyone else is a sound thematic choice.  An AI should feel cold and steady, and humans should seem more, oh I dunno...frantic, I guess?  I didn't pick up on that while watching the movie, but I'll look for it on rewatch.",2023-07-14 00:26:37
"Two days late, but I just saw the movie last night then came here and saw your comment. I agree 100%. I spent almost the whole movie in that uncanny valley. Felt like something was off the entire time. Everything felt just one or two degrees too dramatic/funny/etc. There was always something that left me in a questioning state, and I feel like I need that paid off (maybe like you said with it all being a simulation) or I‚Äôm just going to have to say this was a bad movie.",2023-07-15 15:40:32

"To me she felt like a trained pitbull let off the leash.

"I would watch the shit out of a movie where she just murders people for money. Or for fun. I don‚Äôt know why she does what she does; don‚Äôt really care. But we‚Äôve never seen a character like that in this series, and that‚Äôs refreshing.",2023-07-12 04:35:59
"Agreed, she was a great character. Reminded me of Xenia Onatopp or Mayday. I'm pretty sure she'll be in Part 2. Why else would Coyote from Maverick be like ""She has a pulse!""",2023-07-12 03:55:51

As others have mentioned, it felt *very* expositiony this time.",2023-07-12 06:30:55
"The editing during the action felt, ""different"". I think it way way more shaky and cut way too often, the car chase while fun got very tiring because of this, no wide shots of the action, just close ups of the characters. It felt like they sacrificed the quality of the rest of the action of the movie for the big bike stunt.",2023-07-14 05:27:34
Yeah I felt the same. I think that this movie was good but Fallout was way too good and that's why it feels like it didn't live up to my expectations when it's actually a very good film - Fallout is just superior,2023-07-18 05:17:11

I think the argument for BMW here is in their favor. If anyone knows anything about Germany you know that they absolutely despise the internet.

"My headcanon is that when her bodyguard saw her and said ‚Äúyou changed‚Äù
And she said ‚Äúand you never will‚Äù
His look was initially skeptical of her and he probably noticed her eyes. 

Since she changed and told him ‚Äúand you never will [change]‚Äù he probably fell into being a submissive goon to his boss after his initial skepticism. 

It‚Äôs like he thought ‚Äúshe changed suddenly.‚Äù Then she said that thing to him. 
Then he thought ‚Äúshe probably has colored eye contacts for whatever reason but it‚Äôs best not to question her‚Äù you know as bosses do. 

I think only people from the IMF/other spy agencies and people who were victim to the cloning masks would be aware of it so it makes sense that no one questioned her being she‚Äôs HER (like when someone says he‚Äôs him or hes that guy but for a woman).",2023-07-14 02:05:14

"I couldn't agree with you more.  
I'm completely dumbfounded by the praise for this movie.  This was a huge step backwards from the excellence of Fallout in my opinion.

The writting was embarrassing in some regards. 
For me, this one falls below MI:2.  Ugh.

That opening exposition dump after the sub scene was so painfully executed.   I had a sinking feeling from there and once they killed Ilsa in that bullshit 'fight scene' I was completely checked out emotionally.  

This was such a dud for me that I'm in shock.

I've loved every single entry in the series until now.  And to think.. this is the 'plot' they chose to stretch into 2 movies?  AI as the big bad?
Cringe as hell in my opinion. 

Just my 2 cents.

Man that is disappointing as hell.",2023-07-13 22:43:09

I really like that McQuarrie also continued the tradition of each movie looking visually different from the previous ones. In addition to working with a completely different cinematographer (just like he did for both Fallout and Rogue Nation) he also does some fresh stuff with the camera like utilize a lot of dutch angles which callback to the first movie of the franchise. And big props to Lorne Balfe as well for managing to change up the score from the previous movie. His music works really well for this movie while also managing to sound different from his score for Fallout.,2023-07-12 03:31:27

"Thank god for this comment. I felt like my opinion was insane after seeing the high critic and audience scores and how well-received it seems to be in this sub too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It was probably my least favorite Mission Impossible film aside from #2 which was a real shame since every successive film has gotten better and better since #3. 

You pretty much said everything I wanted to here‚ÄîI‚Äôll add that I found Ilsa and Ethan‚Äôs quasi-date in Venice before her last mission to be really cheesy and a bit OOC for the two of them. Also aside from the train, all the stunts felt like a real rerun of the last 6 films (And I‚Äôm no physicist, but the way the train fell in the end seemed a bit implausible to me). I understand that for some fans it might be a plus that this film pays homage to the old ones, but to me it just felt uncreative after all the amazing stunts we saw in #6. 

Just overall a really disappointing installment in a series I love. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be seeing part two in theaters",2023-07-12 22:13:21
Agreed,2023-07-12 05:18:44
"Pretty much agree with all of this.   
For me, it's really simple, for each MI movie I went and see, after leaving the theatre I had a ""damn, I want to see that again"" feeling. (apart from MI2).  With this one, I didn't have that feeling at all. Maybe only the train sequence making off maybe.",2023-07-24 07:39:17

The action was incredible, but the story wasn't as good as some of the previous ones.

Namely, I don't think they can just add that Gabriel has been around pre M:I 1 without going further into that story.

"Thank you! Its been driving me crazy how they portrayed Ilsa in this movie and you nailed so many good points. Another thing is that not only is Ethan apparently never going to have a relationship with a woman, but its implied IMF agents are like jedi knights? Like that none of them have any personal lives. When they offer Grace to join its treated like she'll have to give up everything. Since when was that part of the IMF? 

In the third movie its like an office that you go to during the day then come home. I always assumed Ving Rhames character was married or something, but apparently they're all ex-criminals who have given up any personal connections to be indebted to the IMF forever. Thats a huge change in the entire franchise and completely made up in this movie! Theres nothing remotely like that in any past entries and its crazy they just drop that in the seventh film!

This films is way dumber than people are saying. Massive changes to the lore, bad characterisation, realy goofy interpretation of AI (He can predict everything but didnt realise Ethan would pick his pocket. So stupid) Just a huge disappointment.",2023-07-17 19:14:06

"Gabriel was chosen by the entity because of his history with Ethan. Ethan is clearly discomforted by Gabriel and the entity appears to see Ethan as his only threat.  Trying to throw Ethan off his game. Im sure they‚Äôll dive deeper into that in sequel.  

Is Haley atwell on the team? It finished with her asking to join the IMF and her efforts in helping on the train proved to be a good trial.

Do agree that some exposition was not as tight as it should be, especially compared to fallout which was basically 2 minutes of exposition and 2 hours of action.",2023-07-12 02:54:27
"I liked this movie, but...yeah I agree the Grace character didnt feel like it belonged.  And Haley is a great actress...but every shot was just her with a weird dopey look, like she has nothing going on inside.  If you are unsure what I mean by the look...when you watch it again you will see",2023-07-12 03:06:03
"For what it's worth, I feel the same way as you. It's a complete surprise to me - the only other example I can think in recent memory where I walked into a movie absolutely expecting a great time and walking away as surprised as I am disappointed was Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. I am a seriously easy-to-please viewer.

I rewatched the last three MI's last week - and, while I can't put my finger on it, something just felt -off- with this one. I spent a lot of time during the movie trying to figure out what it was - and that is part of the problem. I found myself checking my watch a LOT and was seriously tempted to walk out of the movie out of pure boredom - I have never walked out of a movie.

I hate to cast such a wide net, but it felt like a combination of a lack of urgency to the story, a lack of caring what was going on, odd editing choices (it seemed like many sequences had an extra 10% of screentime added on after the on-screen action wrapped up as the characters just finished up like... spending a LOT of time working the gears between the train cars, or the ~FIVE times we cut to Hunt still just put-putting along on his little dirt bike in another nondescript dirt path in the woods radioing that he is STILL on the way,  etc), a VERY odd script, and many sequences that, for whatever reason, just did NOT work for me. 

An example that comes to mind is when Hunt is fighting off the two folks in the claustrophobic alleyway while Grace casually walks up to Gabriel, has a very choppy and uninteresting knife fight, falls down a flight of stairs, Gabriel then... stands there for a bit I suppose, Isla casually walks up, has another pretty uninteresting fight, is bested, all in an absolutely empty, uninspired, uninteresting location. Was this a COVID thing? Why are the dialog sequences - of which, oh baby, do we have dialog sequences that repeatedly explain what The Entity is, or isn't, or where it is, what it might do, how it works - or may not work -, what the key is - or isn't - abstract stakes of what might happen if X, Y, or Z scenarios take place, opining about not only the KEY but the LOCK and the on and on and on - but why are these sequences such oddly cut? Every line of dialog a character says features them in a close-up or dutch angle, cut to another character saying one more sentence, then cut to another, then another, then another - where is everyone? Why is no one in the same shot? Why do none of the lines of dialog build on the previous and instead are declarative sentences about The Entity/choice/decisions/fate/etc.? Where are the creatively blocked moments where Cavill, Fergusson, and Cruise stand around looking simultaneously silly and totally badass? How does the nightclub location in this movie look like such a low-rent version of the club sequence in the last one - with barely anyone actually in the club itself, no interesting sets, and what is the point of the Winamp visualization of The Entity showing up on the TV screens? How did Grace suddenly become Hunt's icon of ""not letting women die""? Did they bond at some point? Why did Ving not stand up during the entire movie? Why have an entire sequence dedicated to him sitting Ethan down to talk with him about his need to disappear for the remainder of the movie so he can program in peace? What is happening?

I am going off on quite a tangent here - I just left very confused. When I left the theater I sat down on a bench to look up if this was a new team or something - nope, same folks who have repeatedly knocked it out of the park, who I imagine have this whole MI thing down pretty well by now - but somehow, my experience felt like a completely different type of movie, made with far less craftsmanship. It felt like watching an example of what MI as a franchise would be if it weren't in the hands of Cruise and his team - but it is. MI, to me, has more often than not demonstrated that a standard-issue summer action flick can actually be made with care and love and set a bar for the Fast and Furious-type projects to aspire to. This one just felt like one of the other ones.

Sorry for the ramble.",2023-07-19 06:59:51
">Unless DR part 2 is absolutely phenomenal, I really don't see how they could drag another 2+ hour movie as a sequel to this almost 3 hour movie that doesn't feel like a slog fest.

I personally can't stand this self-indulgent trend of releasing only half a film. Going into a movie called ""part 1"" just deflates all my expectations prior because they could never possibly make it feel like a satisfying and complete story. I had the same criticisms with Dune Part 1 and Across the Spider-Verse. This movie was just too damn long, and while we get about 3-4 great action sequences in nearly three hours, it's not enough to hold its own as a great film. We can't truly judge it until we've seen the second half (and figure out what the fuck those keys unlock).",2023-07-12 03:15:27
Do you not remember Tom's talk on how the Entity want Gabriel to kill Ilsa and Tom is the only one it is afraid of thus it set the whole drama up so Tom would kill Gabriel in a fit of rage and fail the mission?,2023-07-12 03:33:02
Agreed,2023-07-12 05:17:05

"I just watched it this evening finally and I'm pretty much on the same page as you. 

Almost every conversation was exposition, sometimes two scenes in a row with the same expository dialog. 

Grace betrayed them so many times throughout the movie, to invite her into the IMF and put all hope for saving the world on her went against every instinct I, as a viewer, had while watching. She was selfish, but I guess because she's attractive Ethan chose to trust her? 

Very disappointed. MI and Cruise always seemed to keep such a high standard (MI:2 being the arguable exception) that I'm just baffled by so many of the choices in this movie - both with the characters, and the writers/editors/directors/etc.

It felt more like a Marvel movie than MI.",2024-01-07 03:06:45
"I really don't think Grace and Ethan are meant to be shipped or the Grace Ne the girl he ends up with.

Killing Ilsa gives the films stakes, I‚Äôm actually surprised all these movies have gone by and they never kill off any team members.

"Really weird.  Completely took me out of the movie and every scene with Grace after felt forced, fake and even creepy for some reason.

I did not like anything about this movie.
God, I wish they stopped at Fallout.
It's painfully clear to me that it's all downhill from this point.

All we have to look forward to is more of boring Gabriel and the stupid, non-threatening screen saver AI.

Overall still fun",2023-07-16 03:00:22
Emotion > Entity does come up a lot.,2023-07-12 05:43:35
"> Also not to forget Ethan saying ‚Äúscrew logic‚Äù and actually attempting to kill Gabriel at the end (even Gabriel is confused because he, and by extension the Entity, thought that Ethan would spare him for sake of not knowing what the key would unlock).

 My thought is that Ethan really wasn't going to kill him, but pretending like he was going to in order to distract him enough to do the pick-pocket switcheroo to get the key.",2023-07-15 05:07:19
"It hit me mid way through the movie that the central theme of MI7 is that it's a test of faith.  Faith in yourself, faith in your friends.  It even has a antagonist with a Biblical / Hebrew origin that means ""God is my strength"".  Gabriel was the angel that informs Mary she will bear the son of God.

In the movie, the Entity could or would be considered ""God"" and Gabriel is the messenger.

The key looking like a cross is about as subtle as a sledgehammer.",2023-07-16 11:56:38
Great observation. I was also surprised Ethan would actually kill Gabriel like that.,2023-07-14 05:56:26

"But seriously, M:I has a solid claim to being one of the best franchises out there. There's a solid argument that none of the movies are even ""bad"". 2 is definitely the weakest, but still a solid action flick.

Also, who is that good at talking?!

I definitely had some issues with this movie but had a fun time with it regardless. That scene, however, was right at the beginning and definitely had me very worried about the rest of the movie.

People are hardy creatures, there are records of people getting stabbed TENS of times and surviving. With proper and immediate medical care, if someone is alive when you find them they can be saved.

"Everyone took turns too. 

Now you, okay him for a bit, now you, now her",2023-07-22 18:43:39
"I watched it a second time, feeling a bit strange after the first viewing. I‚Äôm not saying the ideas I present are perfectly executed in the script, but rather this is the angle I believe they were trying to take.

1) in regards to The Entity, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to make discourse on A.I, but rather play with the idea that there‚Äôs nothing the good guys can do that the villain can‚Äôt predict, except for the valour of heroes and redemption of bad guys. Its basically Ethan Hunt vs Evil God, with Gabriel (named after the Messenger of the Bible) being the mouthpiece. It‚Äôs Ethan Hunt vs destiny.

2) Tangential to point 2, it‚Äôs less about plausibility and more about a type of villain getting under the skin of characters more than any other previous villain. Solomon Lane as a villain already infiltrated the good guys as far as humanly possible; The Entity is going beyond and getting pretty much in their heads. Remember, we never know the motives for The Entity, because the Entity does not speak. We only hear what people interpret the Entity is trying to achieve. Orchestrating a riddle nuke is part of its mysterious way.

3) The two agents aren‚Äôt the only paper thin characters. The bizarre thing about the MI series is that almost all the characters are thin. Think about it: what have you learnt about Luther since the original film? Nothing: he hacks computers. What about Benji since 3? He knows how to wear masks now. Ilsa? Literally nothing. The original movie also has the main character from the series act as merely the plot twist for the movie. But the weird part is it all works. Ethan Hunt himself barely exists as a character; all I see is Tom Cruise doing stunts.  And when you think about it, the characters only exist to chain the story along, and when they‚Äôre not needed they are cut. Think about Ethan‚Äôs ex wife, who doesn‚Äôt exist in this movie, who probably is the person he loves the most, yet the Entity doesn‚Äôt target her as a weak point of Ethan. 

4) This fourth point strikes me as odd because if there‚Äôs one thing this film lacked, is lots of actions scenes. At almost three hours long, we get only *three* main action sequences: Dubai, Rome, and Austria. We get one major stunt in Austria. Rogue Nation and Fallout had a few more major action sequences and shorter running times.

The other odd thing you mentioned was ‚Äúaction in expense of plot‚Äù. Like‚Ä¶ what are you comparing this to? The Bourne series? It‚Äôs been obvious since 1996 that Mission Impossible‚Äôs plots have only existed to string together action scenes. It‚Äôs an excuse for Tom Cruise to do stupid stunts. The marketing ploy for this film literally was ‚ÄúDid you see Tom drove a motorcycle off a mountain?‚Äù. Nobody has ever cared about the villains, characters or story in the films. I mean, it‚Äôs kind of a joke that Ethan and his team can barely work with the government in most movies; somehow they‚Äôre always going rogue. If you‚Äôve been watching Mi for the plot‚Ä¶ oh boy, man. You‚Äôre gonna love Bourne and James Bond even more, where they actually take the story seriously lol.

But anyway, watching it a second time made me see the film for what it is, and now I‚Äôm glad. Watching it the first time you‚Äôd expect another Fallout, but it has a different vibe that you‚Äôll want if you rewatch the series. Like I said, it doesn‚Äôt execute perfectly what it tries to do, but it‚Äôs a really fantastic film nevertheless. 

It‚Äôs initial disappoint only serves to tell us Fallout truly is one of the greatest action movies ever made though!",2023-07-25 15:10:50

Also, the fake out killing her like 1 hour earlier also took away from her real death. They should not have faked her death, only to really kill her later. That is... just a bad move, writing wise.

Ilsa is donezo unfortunately.

"- Ilsa dies form Gabriel's knife, but Paris, wounded exactly the same, goes on to save Ethan and Grace, pulls them up the train carriage and proceeds to survive? Wow.

- Ethan gets a ""he was a baddie"" before joining the IMF prequel story all of a sudden? Really? In M:I he already seemed like a decent person with morals, parents to care about, where is the character development coming from? It shocked me that Tom Cruise approved this, just so Gabriel‚Äôs whole character had a reason to exist. Why did he need to? Lane was introduced completely from scratch and it worked out fine.

- Gabriel standing on top of the train, waiting for his escape point. Then, Ethan confronts him, making them fight on top of the train while dodging light signals and a tunnel. What would have happened if Ethan would not have been there? Would Gabriel just played jump and run on that train's roof by himself while waiting to arrive at his planned escape point?

- How many times will Grace betray Ethan and straight up leave him to die in the subway? Why on Earth did the writers seem it would be plausible to write her character like that? How dumb does she get to be to not understand Ethan to help her. Even Ilsa got this quicker and she was even more hostile towards Ethan at first. Tiring, to say the least.

- Gabriel‚Äôs escape point. He calculates the exact acceleration and speed of an old steam-powered train, to know exactly when to jump and land and his prepared truck? How would you know the exact peripherals of the machine to do that? Did the AI calculate this? So it has to be mentioned in the movie.

- Also, who kept the train running and shoveling coal into the combustion chamber? The train should go slower, instead of full speed the whole time.

- The whole plan to board the train with a motorcycle, resulting in driving up a mountain and a base jump into the train. Meanwhile, Paris just stands on top of a bridge and jumps down to the train. Really, the whole Ethan's IMF super-intelligence guys would not have thought of that?

- AI sets itself into a submarine and destroys it, so the original code needed to stop it would get destroyed as well? Transfer yourself into a house, trigger some systems to cause a fire, burn down the house with the original code. Why would the AI risk that the original code to delete it would still be retrievable?

- The key has infinite power to glow the jewels or what? Or do they have to put it into a charging station from time to time or whatever?

- Ilsa gets defeated by Gabriel? Like, have you seen her fight in Rogue Nation or Fallout, the guys she defeated there?

- Car chase in Rome: Paris just walks away after wrecking half of the police fleet with her Hummer and nobody minds? It is not even shown how she escapes. Just another ""Somehow, Palpatine returned""

- Too predictable. What is Part 2 going to be? Start sequence, Ethan dives down to Sevastopol, tries to delete the AI, that goes wrong, AI loads itself into a satellite in orbit, the whole rest of the movie is going to be about flying into space to delete the AI on that satellite?

Then all the other characters, what happened? I wouldn't mind if it was just ""some"" M:I part in the middle, but Dead Reckoning is meant to be the final installment to the franchise, so there are some ends to tie together.

No mention of Solomon Lane or the Syndicate? CIA director Sloane just gets a picture on the wall? Is she dead? What happened to her after Fallout? What happened to William Brandt? What is Julia up to? Maybe all these actors were not meant to be hired to create the next parts of the M:I franchise, I get that. But at least mention them, so it does not feel like they were all meaningless and the plot lines completely forgotten.

Sadly, I can't help but think that was intentional from Tom cruise(a very hands on producer), they already planted the seed in MI6:fallout which is why I didn't like it as much as critics did. So, It's in a lot way a soft-reboot of the franchise to something dumber and funnier in order to appeal to the widest demographic possible in the hope of a massive boxoffice success.( I curiously felt the same about the way of water)

Had to be scheduling conflicts 100% in my mind. With her TV show Silo and Dune I bet she just couldn't commit to filming Part 2. Agreed that her death scene should have been more impactful though.

> Gabriel sucks. mustache twirling charmless void of a villain speaking pseudo intellectual techno babble. Why is he so evil he partnes with the AI? didn't care for the random flashes to him killing someone in Ethan's life with no explanation. What a massive drop off from Solomon Lane and Cavill

Wouldn't be surprised at all in Part 2 if they reveal he has just been a mouthpiece for the Entity all along and has pretty much just been regurgitating what's said to him. As for motive it could be just as simple as wanting something from his past wiped clean. We saw that the AI can erase him from camera footage instantly, maybe just wanted to be wiped clean in general.

The other ¬Ω has a more convoluted path:

A courier has it in Instanbul

Ilsa takes it from the courier and goes to the desert

Ilsa gives it to Ethan in the desert.

Ethan has it all the way until Grace pickpockets it and flies to Rome. She plants it on a random person she sat next to on the flight. She doesn't have it for the entirety of the police station and car chase scenes 

While Grace is off screen she collects the key from the fellow passenger and then leaves Rome to go to Venice.  

At the party when Ethan causes a distraction, Grace plants the key on Zola. As Grace leaves she retrieves the key and keeps it until the train.

The whole buyer at the airport with the fake key is to allow Grace and Ethan to meet up. A plan on both the White Widow's and Gabriel/Entity's part. Which is why Gabriel has Paris kill the buyer.",2023-07-30 18:35:47

See how broken up he is about Ilsa for one short mournful look over a balcony? So profound is his devotion to women (the gorgeous ones, anyways), that an all-powerful entity bases its plan for world domination around it.

"Agree 100 percent. I was very disappointed not with the fact that she dies per se but how, when and where she dies. She barely had any lines, they kill her off in the first half of the movie and they have her loose to a villain that was physically not threatening at all and that she should have easily bested (knowing how capable she is from the previous two entries). The villain then consistently loses physical fights for the rest of the movie, gets basically owned by Ethan at the end, so it really makes her defeat even more bizarre. 
They did a really poor job at making me believe she could lose that fight.

There was barely any grief from the rest of the team, including Ethan. But thats inevitable if you decide to kill off a major character when there's so much of the movie left. You can't have people mourning for hours, I get it, but that's why i disagree even more with the ""when"" she dies. Honestly I feel they should have killed her off at the end of the third act and all the train chaos. She should have coexisted and interacted way more with Grace. She should have been on that train and be part of that final mission. She should have died at the end when things go awry, make her sacrifice herself for the mission. Have her die to save Grace. That would've made the ""switch"" to Grace WAY better, and it would have given way more gravitas to why Ethan cares so much about her (being that Ilsa sacrificed herself to save her).

 It would have also been a real gut punch to end part 1. They have the key but they lost Ilsa. It also would have made the griefing part way smoother and easier. End part 1 with a grieving team, start part 2 (starting some weeks/months later) showing Ethan still struggling with the loss. It would have given the impression that the team truly took a hit, and Ethan is indeed struggling to cope with the loss, all without the need to spend too much time on it.

Very poorly executed, and it really did feel like they killed her off right away to make space for Grace as if the two couldn't coexist. I got to say her death kind of took me out from the movie a bit, simply for how rushed it felt. Could've been so much better.",2023-07-13 13:36:15

">This AI (which is unrelated to the Entity, I think? or is it?) goes ""rogue"" and causes the destruction of the Sevestapol, leaving it a wreck at the bottom of the Bering Sea.

I think the point is the Entity infected the Sebastopol and caused its destruction to have a safe place to store itself. I mean a sub in the bottom of the artic ocean it's as safe as it get for a non-living thing. Being ""virtual"" in the cyberspace, that spherical thing in the sub would be the Entity's core (source code as they say in the movie) and basically its heart. If the Entity is really sentient it would make sense that its first priority would be self-preservation and avoid being killed or enslaved. The thing for all its power and capabilities isn't even hostile as it could be. No nukes, no financial collapse, its only motivation seems to be survival.

The original *inhabitant* of the Sebastopol core was just a lesser AI system I guess.",2023-07-14 17:37:36

I'm pretty sure though the AI could have got Benji's voice in multiple ways, and what if they had just chosen to ignore the suspicious bag alert? So many things in this movie weren't explained well.

They were supposed to film it in March of that year along with some big action scenes in Venice (that is different than what is shown in the movie) but it all got shut down due to Covid until Fall 2020. Most of the reason the film feels disjointed is because of how much they had to chop and change for Covid lockdowns. Fast X shot their stuff there last Spring.,2023-07-15 22:20:38

"> Sooooo this movie was basically a dig at AI coming for movies right? 

I don't think so, this was written way before AI became a major factor in our world in the way of images and text generation.

If you reverse engineer the plot, it makes sense. If you're trying to create a dangerous enemy, how can that interact with the heroes and debilitate them? Well, they rely a shit ton on computers, satellites, and technology. What about if - all of a sudden - that technology is unreliable and they're unable to use it? That's an interesting case study.

"> Am I the only one who thinks Fallout was one of the franchise's weaker entries?

Definitely in the minority. It's usually somewhere in the Top 3 for most people's rankings, especially for those that got to see it in theaters. 

- The stunts

- The music

- The misdirect before the opening credits is just behind MI:3 as the opening as the best in the series in my opinion

- The villain(s) 

- The on-location shooting in Norway/New Zealand give some of the best looking scenes in the franchise

- Every main character gets their moment to shine, including Rebecca Ferguson going toe-to-toe with Tom Cruise in back to back movies

- The final act with the helicopter chase simultaneously split with Luther/Michelle Monaghan defusing a nuclear bomb simultaneously split with the cabin fight scene with Illsa/Benji/Solomon Lane


I'd recommend a rewatch if you haven't seen it in awhile.",2023-07-13 07:30:03
"Its not my favourite but its easily the best one in the franchise in terms of pure action/stunt work (bathroom scene, halo jump, paris chase, helicopter). I will go as far as saying its the best film ever in terms of action and stunts and I don't see it being topped anytime soon.

That being said, the script felt a bit hollow. I was more invested in the next outlandish action set piece than the story/characters.

Rogue Nation is my favourite because of Ethan and Ilsa's dynmanic. Thought it was really charming and the action is also top tier (although doesn‚Äôt top Fallout).

A weird comparison is that although Raiders of the Lost Arc is the better film (Fallout) I prefer the Last Crusade (Rogue Nation) because of Ford/Connery (Cruise/Ferguson). Same thing with Die Hard and Die Hard 3. Bruce and Sam are just so fun to watch.",2023-07-13 07:48:38

"Spoilers:

The whole Hayley Atwell character and story was a mess.

First we are led to believe that there‚Äôs some chemistry between her and Cruise just hours/days after the apparent death of the Rebecca Ferguson character. No time for grief in the IMF.

After that is revealed to be misdirection, we are then witness to Atwell double crossing Cruise numerous times and Cruise given the decision to choose between Ferguson (who he presumably loved) and Atwell who he met 2 mins ago.

He doesn‚Äôt choose and we lose Ferguson as a result.",2023-07-17 20:16:44

The main chick causes a major death because she ran away from Ethan after like the 4th time he saved her ass.

Just stuff like that.  The movie was a solid 7/10, but after the ghost protocol/rogue nation/fallout best 3 movie run ever, I was expecting more.

"I think the way it happens is more upsetting than the fact it happens. There's essentially no response after the death of a highly valued friend and team member from the last two movies by any of the guys. We just go into the next scene where for some reason none of them are pissed at Grace, who has backstabbed Hunt like 4 times at this point and left him behind, the latter of which leading to the confrontation at the bridge.

Instead we just get a scene where they're like ""Well Grace, that sucks but wasn't your fault, time to join IMF because you're a criminal and by the way we've retconned 7 movies in that all IMF agents are criminals""

We spend all of MI3-MI6 seeing how deeply Hunt cares about his wife, with the scene at the end of 6 being a passing of baton from Julia to Ilsa as the woman in Hunt's life. And then they kill off Ilsa like its nothing and we just zoom forward to Hunt now having romantic chemistry with Grace. It was just awfully done. Ilsa's death should have been an earth-shattering moment for Hunt in this two part finale, not a footnote halfway through Part 1.",2023-07-18 16:48:19

Throughout most of the movie, Alanna is already in possession of one half of the key. The Swiss guy at the airport has a decoy (presumably given the same radioactive signature to make it a more convincing fake, despite not being spot-on with the alloy). Swiss guy is there with the decoy to attract Ethan so that Grace, hired by Alanna, can bait Ethan by pickpocketing the decoy, then pickpocket Ilsa's half of the key off Ethan.

Amid the chaos caused by Gabriel/Paris and the CIA guys, Grace succeeds in getting Ilsa's half from Ethan, slips to the guy on the plane and then presumably meets him offscreen to retrieve it after ditching Ethan in Rome.

In Venice, Grace plants Ilsa's half on Zola, then sneaks it back out of his pocket in the chaos following Gabriel's departure. Presumably Gabriel fails to search Grace for the key after fighting Ilsa because he saw Zola pat her down earlier and believes she must not have brought it with her (and she tells him as much at the party).

On the train, Grace gets Alanna's half after knocking her out, and is now in possession of both halves, which she reveals to Kittridge, and you are able to track the completed key's journey from there pretty easily.",2023-07-19 04:20:40

Either one are good choices.,2023-07-19 21:33:27
Ethan jumps off the train with the parachute leaving Grace behind as it only holds one person. Paris is still alive and found by Kittridge and crew who also catch Grace and she tells him she wants to join the IMF. Ethan lands his parachute next to Benji and they peace out. Gabriel finds out Ethan pick pocketed the key from him. (geez don't play a drinking game for every time someone gets pick pocketed),2023-07-19 14:57:08
Yep. If gabriel even just obtained one half of the key and destroyed it then no one could access the sub anymore. He could have gotten it from grace after she was knocked out at the bridge but he astoundingly left her alone after he killed ilsa. My guess is that gabriel is playing lapdog now but he wants to control the entity himself and needed both halves. The entity isn't that scary. It couldn't do anything in the train because it was an old school showdown without electronics and it didn't go full skynet and hired a whole platoon of former syndicates anonymously to stop the imf.,2023-07-20 02:32:39

Sounds like they should‚Äôve saved the BTS for after the movie had been out for a bit. I never saw it before watching and didn‚Äôt notice any of the CGI for the ramp or wheels because I was focused on Tom,2023-07-13 00:07:31
"Well, that and it was replayed over and over and over everywhere.

However, it still is basically his most dangerous stunt. Everything else he's done he was attached or there was a net. This was basically in the hands of the parachute packing.",2023-07-14 03:07:10
"I thought it would fall a bit flat for me, because it didn't quite land in the trailer for me. I guess the context was all I needed, because it just worked for me during the movie, despite the fact that I've seen that stunt like 20 times by now.",2023-07-15 08:33:59
"I thought it fell flat because they hyped it up so much talking about it as if it were a oner from off the cliff to a train all in one, and im like ""dope!  Lets gooo!!"" And i see it and it looked like every other jumping off a cliff scene in a movie.  James Bond, Jackie Chan.  Heck, Jackie jumped off of a cliff on to a hot air balloon!!

I feel like the BIG stunt could be in the next one?",2023-07-17 09:21:53
"This is what ruins a lot of the incredible stunts in the film (like the train) there is so much CGI added to make it all more intense or to make it more ""real"" by removing or adding elements. It takes away from the real action.",2023-07-17 11:41:58
The train crash is the most CGI looking practical effect I can think of.,2023-07-17 00:42:02
"I saw so much behind the scenes content about that stunt, the moment fell flat for me in the actual movie. Also, the CGI was incredibly distracting.",2023-07-17 18:53:50
Agreed.,2023-07-14 22:54:11
The BTS scene's focus on Tom as the subject was better than what was in the movie IMHO,2023-07-18 08:10:21
"That was my biggest gripe with the movie. They spent so much time and effort to do practical dangerous stunts, only to dress them up with so much CGI that the whole thing looked fake.",2023-07-16 16:04:57
I always feel the same about the storm in the HALO jump.,2023-07-18 05:08:48
The fall into water and the items falling through the train looked pretty bad,2023-07-19 15:31:46
The bike jump did nothing for me.  It honestly felt shoe-horned in. The guy scaled the Burj without ropes (the character).  How do you top that??,2023-07-16 05:07:31
"> Same goes for the train which was real, the water it crashes into is CGI or heavily adjusted in comp.

The train was real, the cut with the train car falling into the water was fake. Same with all the crap on the train falling toward the actors when they're suspended.",2023-07-16 07:05:48
my question remains: what happened to the bike?  (IRL) - is that canyon just littered with junked bikes?,2023-07-17 14:34:57
Idk it was absolutely silent in my theater when it finally happened and hit very hard for me. I also saw it in Dolby Cinema theater so,2023-07-18 06:29:04
"Totally agree, it's a shame since it's practical but there's enough CGI uncanniness to lose its full oomph.",2023-07-20 03:50:23
It was lame as hell compared to what we got in previous movies,2023-07-20 09:36:46
"I was really hoping he would actually parachute land parallel to the top of the moving train. 

Instead he just literally blows a hole through the side to enter the train. Meh. It was a bit flat. Still a very cool and impressive stunt he performed.",2023-07-24 08:26:21
Crazy that in one of Mr beasts new videos he literally sent a train into a huge hole. They should have gotten the video sponsored by MI,2023-07-20 06:29:02
"Damn, people these days have a deformation in their brain forcing them to seek out CGI everywhere or something. Never noticed any jarring CGI and felt no need to look for it intentionally.",2023-10-18 22:24:40
The train cars slowly falling like dominoes sequence is my favorite action sequence i've seen in a long time,2023-07-16 07:38:35
That was ripped from the beginning of Uncharted 2 and you can't change my mind.,2023-09-15 08:36:22
Agreed. All these people are complaining because they knew there was a ramp. I was just focused on Tom and the fact that he was really jumping off that cliff. The scene paid off big time for me,2023-07-13 00:09:17
"Just saw the film and googled about the stunt. He did 500 skydives and 13,000 motorbike jumps to train for it. Shit.",2023-08-06 02:41:19
"The ads selling off that stunt were amazing I think, they hyped the scene without spoiling the movies. It just made the scene more impressive. I hadn't seen any trailer other than those ads.",2024-03-03 16:35:42
"‚ÄúAll is it is just base jumping‚Äù ‚Äúanybody can do that on vacation‚Äù 

Bro are you high? He drove a motorcycle up and off a ramp off a cliff AND THEN deployed his parachute. what are u talking about with vacation?",2023-07-12 21:21:07
I was surprised Ethan Hunt was worried at all about it. Seemed like something very doable considering sverything else he's done.,2023-07-12 06:01:09
"What do you mean that you could BASE jump on vacay?

You have to (with any reputable instructor) have a couple hundred skydives under your belt before BASE jumping.  

I have several friends who BASE, some with hundreds of jumps... And they all agree that it was nuts that the person who did it... Was the actor himself.

Because of your mentality, the desensitized to action, people like you do not realize that this is quite possibly one of the greatest movie stunts ever done.",2023-07-12 15:41:59
I freakin loved that we knew nothing about that absolutely insane train sequence.,2023-07-13 02:36:45
"Yeah I felt sort of underwhelmed on the jump scene when it was first released because it really doesn‚Äôt seem that crazy. And then seeing a behind the scenes on it made it even worse for when we see it in the movie, you can tell he‚Äôs on a smooth ramp, the bikes movement doesn‚Äôt match with the terrain at all. He would be going 20 mph max by the time he gets to that peak!",2023-07-12 10:48:16
But I will say his entrance into the train totally caught me off guard.,2023-07-13 02:37:33
How is this moronic comment being upvoted? Cruise had to put weeks of practice into that stunt. You could not just do that on vacation.,2023-07-14 16:02:23
Yeah you sound pretty numb to it.,2023-07-13 05:50:36
The bike jump is much much more dangerous than the stunt where he hangs onto the plane since for that one he had a bunch of safety. Also do you really think the leaping from the train was an actual stunt?,2023-07-14 00:22:40
I feel like the most impressive thing about the bike jump was the engineering and logistics of building a ramp like that on a mountain.,2023-07-12 11:33:51
"How much of that train stunt was for real, though? A lot of it looked green screen-y",2023-07-12 15:26:07
"It was, but i dont get why the cars kept sliding in. Theres like 8 cars on the orient express. This looked longer. Anyway, the weight of one isnt gonna slide the other 7. And if it could, the weight of that last one shouldve been able to drag the 3 left easily.",2023-07-15 13:51:51
and that bike stunt was already done by someone else.,2023-07-12 19:20:37
"I believe Paris jumped onto the train before Gabriel made the train go full-speed and broke the brakes.

As for Ethan, the original plan *was* to jump on when the train slowed down around a corner, but it was moving too fast to do so.

I think it‚Äôs believable that Ethan couldn‚Äôt simply pull up next to the train and hop on at that point. Those old steam-engine trains can get up to 75 mph when at full-throttle whereas a dirt bike can only go 50-60 and he was on very uneven ground.

It‚Äôs fine if you think it would be possible, but I think the film made enough excuses that the need for the basejump was warranted.",2023-07-13 12:41:11
There is a ton of plot holes honestly. Like. Why didn‚Äôt he just sneak on the train before it left.,2023-07-16 21:33:31
The bit where the aa gun shoots back at the aft carriages when the train hits the curve was cool tho,2023-07-12 22:22:16

"I wasnt talking about mourning per se. I didn‚Äôt feel like her character was given much importance in this film. They treated Ilsa as if the actress was in some contract dispute or something and they had to kill her character off somehow. It wasn‚Äôt like Rebecca was giving her peak performance and her character suffered a tragic death. 
Ethan was basically doing the ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna play with you anymore‚Äô meme after he met Grace.",2023-07-13 21:04:59
"Yeah, that fight was pretty bad. I also don't understand why they had to play into Gabriel's prediction. Or why she thought a sword was the way to do it rather than, I don't know, the sniper rifle she was seen using in her first scene.",2023-11-13 04:55:35
Fully agree - I was searching for this comment. No way that they end a major character like Ilsa in such a way and don't mention her again.,2023-09-12 14:01:28

Which, for some reason, suddenly became a choice between Ilsa, her current lover and spy buddy who Ethan has known and had adventures with for quite some time, and Grace, who he literally just met.

"Yeah, I'm betting his past with Ethan and connection with the Entity (like how it recruited him) will be more focused on in Part 2. At least, I hope so.

"It seems we have come full circle with video game burrowing stuff from movies. Now it seems like the other way around is happening. But then again there‚Äôs only so many times you can reinvent an action scene across mediums especially if you include every James Bond movie ever:

**WARNING MANY SPOILERS INCOMING**

You Only Live Twice: helicopter battle done with *REAL helicopters* and you actively wonder how it was all choreographed.

On Her Majesty‚Äôs Secret Service: the ski chase is still pretty unmatched to this day 54 years later - it‚Äôs basically ‚Äúpraise the stuntmen and cameramen for having some really big balls‚Äù the ski chase. Henchmen skiing down a mountain with no ski poles and wielding machine guns, and Bond is skiing with 1 ski at one point because the other has been shot off.

The Empire Strikes Back: at its core the Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader fight is a very bare-knuckle version of a sword fight. Luke is still inexperienced and being quite brash facing Vader when he hasn‚Äôt completed his Jedi training and you can tell throughout that Vader is in control of the fight which of course culminates in Luke losing one of his hands and his lightsaber 

Raiders of the Lost Ark: a 1 man army snaps victory from the jaws of defeat in a car chase that includes our hero Indy being shot in the shoulder, said injured shoulder pummeled many times and then somehow surviving being dragged behind by a truck at 35 mph for more than several seconds

Die Hard 1: jumping off an exploding rooftop using a fire hose attached to its wheel as an improvised harness. But then the wheel falls off the roof and threatens to drag John McClane with it off the building. McClane manages to free himself from the hose just in time.

The Living Daylights: in another case of ‚Äúpraise the stuntmen for having enormous balls‚Äù, Bond and fights the bad guy on a netted cargo palette attached to the cargo hold when all of a sudden the cargo hold opens up and you see bond and the bad guy nearly fall off the still attached palette multiple times throughout their fight

License to Kill: James Bond hijacks one of four Kenworth tanker trucks loaded with heroin dissolved in gasoline and gives chase to the main villain in said truck on a narrow two lane road that has no guardrails, and somehow does a wheelie in said truck in one of the greatest cases of ‚Äúpraise the stunt driver‚Äù ever

Speed: the entire premise really. Done before with the 1975 Japanese movie ‚ÄúThe Bullet Train‚Äù but more exhilarating 

Goldeneye: ‚Äúno one‚Äôs ever done a car chase in which the good guy steals a tank to chase the bad guy‚Äôs car - in city streets. Let‚Äôs do it what‚Äôs stopping us?!‚Äù And I can‚Äôt name anything that has successfully ripped off or paid homage to this chase scene ever since.

Mission Impossible 1: a fight on top of the TGV as it goes through the channel tunnel. Definitely a homage to this as well in the train fight in Dead Reckoning part 1. 

Temple of Doom: chase sequence in minecarts with the tracks going through areas that don‚Äôt make much sense such as over lava pools. Lots of clever quick cutting to hide the use of miniatures though.

Last Crusade: the tank chase ends with Indiana Jones leaping off at the last second to grab a vine growing out of the cliff face. Admittedly leaning into clear Deus Ex Machina territory though imo.

The Dark Knight: Batman has to fight his way up an under construction building to find the joker and free hostages except he has to fight the Gotham City Police Department SWAT Team as well because he suddenly realizes the hostages are dressed up as the guards and Vice versa specifically to bait the GCPD into shooting the wrong people   

Mission impossible 4 ghost protocol: Tom Cruise scaling the Burj Khalifa albeit with harnesses digitally removed in post-production. Later leads to a footchase in a sandstorm in Dubai. Both Ethan Hunt and the audience are basically blind to their surroundings but given the situation of the set piece it works. 

Even video games have some great action scenes of their own if they go into ‚Äúoutlandishly entertaining‚Äù territory sometimes:

Uncharted 2: you fight your way to the front of a train, culminating in the train derailing in the Indian Himalayas and you have to make your way back up the train wreckage before the carriages plummet you to death - the screenwriters or Tom Cruise almost certainly played Uncharted 2 and must have thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs been 13 years since the game has been released let‚Äôs hope no one notices‚Äù

Uncharted 3: the plane fight scene. Nathan Drake desperately hangs onto the loose but still attached cargo palettes as they swing around in the air all while he‚Äôs trying to make his way back to the plane and shooting the guys in the opened up cargo hold on the way. Definitely the The Living Daylights plane fight scene on steroids.

Black Ops 1: Mason and Woods steal an Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter to fight their way through heavy North Vietnamese held territory after successfully escaping capture

Modern Warfare 2: Part 2 of the Washington DC level after the airburst EMP detonates. Neither side has comms, air superiority nor electronic aids. Red dot sights are useless, iron sights are back in. It‚Äôs time for old schoolness in a 21st century war environment.

2013 Tomb Raider game: escaping a C-130 being suddenly shot down by lightning, escaping a burning and collapsing Japanese temple complex, shooting your way through an army of undead samurai, and *lots and lots of ice wall climbing*",2023-07-12 09:43:12

"Yeah it really doesn't make any sense when you think about it. That clock would only work for that specific car of the train, which means that he knew he had to be there in order for that exit plan to succeed. The plan also required him to accelerate the train at the exact right time; If the accelerated any sooner or any later, then he could have been hundreds feet off.",2023-07-12 03:14:22

It took me right out of the movie and knocked it down a grade for me. It was just so cartoonish! The other thing was when Ethan flew into the train at just the right time and has the parachute gag.

"Into a tiny truck bed at like 60+ no less! A body moving at that speed just falls through the air like a bag of potatoes and he would have been smeared like paste on the inside of that truck bed. 

That would have been hilarious to witness when the camera panned back to the truck bed. Just dead everywhere.",2023-07-24 08:20:03
"My issue was the two officers/agents who had been tailing Ethan the whole movie climbing out onto the top of the train.  I can see Ethan and Gabriel doing that, but those guys? Nah. I also didn't care for their weird little conversation on the train right before that whole action sequence started. Good movie, but a lot of the needless dialogue that wasn't much more than expository setup for Part 2 should've been cut.",2023-07-13 02:02:49

"I feel a bit ticked off about the timer now

Gabriel's fight could've gone in so many ways, that he could've ended up in a different position on the train. So his cue to jump off the train was a location guide to where the truck would be, but no way to know ""when"" his character would be crossing paths with the truck",2023-07-12 09:18:00

"I think Gabriel will do a Moriarty from Sherlock where he'll come to some sort of realisation and kill himself either to help the Entity or to help Ethan defeat the Entity. 

As for how I think the Entity will be defeated, I think Ethan will be a few seconds away from inserting the key and then destroy it because he realises that the Entity WANTS him to insert the key because it knows that the key will actually unlock its full potential. I wouldn't surprised if it's revealed that the key actually contains a part of the Entity that when inserted into the Sevastopol mainframe unlocks it and frees it.",2023-07-12 17:54:41
"Completely agree. I was thinking I had to rewatch the first movie because I don‚Äòt remember anything from this.

As for Ilsa‚Äòs death I did not like it either. Also, the way it is done. She has a much longer blade, there‚Äòs no way she loses against Gabriel with a pocket knive.",2023-07-12 07:33:19
Multiple moments in Dead Reckoning (especially the voiceover monologue at the end) really seemed to be foreshadowing Benji's death.,2023-07-13 06:12:42
"Rhames and Pegg had literally zero role in this movie, tbh. It's always nice seeing them but they had very little consequence on the story. Rhames was there to set up the tension of not killing Gabriel, and Pegg was there as a contrived setup for the cliff jump.",2023-07-15 10:29:36

"I was kind of confused on Kittridge‚Äôs overall goal. He seemed like he wanted the key for the government, Elwes wanted the key for personal gain or his ambition I believe (to use the covert agent to do anything he wanted across the globe and make the country the only super power), but Kittridge‚Äôs message for Ethan at the end sounded like he was on Ethan‚Äôs side because he was still talking to him like his mission, Ethan‚Äôs mission to destroy the AI, is still good to proceed.

Maybe I misheard or didn‚Äôt pay close enough attention but that was my thought.",2023-07-16 04:24:33

>I also do not understand the connection between the entity and Gabriel. Ok so Gabriel is some bad guy from Ethan‚Äôs past ok. Then what has the entity got to do with him? How coincidental that the entity would somehow be aligned with someone from Ethan‚Äôs past?

I took it that the entity specifically chose him to act as its agent because she's aware of his and Ethan's past.

How they interact? I am guessing emails, watch, whatever.",2023-07-15 07:59:12
There's a whole scene where Vince tells Ethan it's no surprise the entity chose Gabriel because it's trying to get to Ethan emotionally and make him act irrationally i.e. killing Gabriel out of rage instead of keeping him alive,2023-07-19 01:48:56

"If I hadn't rewatched the series before going into this I definately would've felt that this one was an odd one out, but no it totally reminds me heavily of the first Mission Impossible. Thought Grace would be a mole tho. She give's off Mole-y vibes tbh she might still be. Dunno who she'd be mole-ing for tho, prolly the entity. Backstory's just a little bit too clean tho. I know Ethan always gets the irl he currently cares about, but seems a little be too stage, y hunch is based entirely on the fact that the White Widow say's she ""hand picked"" her.",2023-07-15 13:00:21
"> At the same time I love that they switched things up and gave us something we weren't expecting.

Was anyone actually turned off? The last sets of films tying together and having a related thread and characters, e.g. the Syndicate and then continuing that storyline was great.

Having to see Ethan pull Sleight of Hand every 5 minutes was annoying. And then having a car chase that was unnecessarily inserted (what's with films adding more chase scenes that add nothing?) was quite silly.",2023-07-16 07:09:32

The whole flashback to the stabbing in the alley that brought Ethan to IMF looked like the scene in M:I where he finds his teammate stabbed by Krieger in the alley.",2023-07-16 13:06:35
"Yea I felt the same way, and am in the camp of ‚Äúturned off‚Äù. Just felt like it went backwards after getting bigger, better, and modern with Rogue Nation, Ghost Protocol, and Fallout.

I think it would‚Äôve worked better if it didn‚Äôt lean on as much stylistically paying homage and just had a couple of scenes/nods to the earlier films, but I don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôll see. 

May be cool if they do the next one as a balls-to-the-wall action movie that we‚Äôve gotten used to and then it‚Äôll be like part 1 reflected the first half of the series and part 2 the second, but yeah just this one standalone fell kind of flat for me. 

Train sequence was fantastic though.",2023-07-16 18:49:44

"Except the first film was the closest to the TV show where they pulled off impeccably planned heists with a group of agents possessing diverse skills.

I think it was Rogue Nation that had him crashing a car, getting out and then immediately tripping and falling over.",2023-07-15 23:51:00
"I actually disliked that a bit - not the disorientation bit, more the whole thing

Ethan's character is about doing ""the impossible"" with some skill or finesse, like he's done in the other movies

Coincidentally *crashing* into the train, right into a bad guy at the right time to save Grace... that all felt more like something I would see with Jack Sparrow in everything after Black Pearl

Which I would be fine with, there's some silly bits scattered throughout the MI series, but I don't like that feeling for that particular prominent stunt",2023-07-24 01:09:55

Her motivation was very confusing in this part of the story. She is a thief, she‚Äôs looking to for a big payday and presumably live to enjoy it. So she takes the key away from the White Widow, who hired her, and presumably would pay her for it. Then she runs away from Ethan yet again. Then finally when she sees Gabriel she decides to fight him. So who is she looking to sell the key to? A more natural reaction when she saw Gabriel on the bridge would be to try to sell him the key.

Makes me wonder how The Entity would respond to asking what it wants... ü§î

It reminds me a little of a book series about a decade ago about a self-aware AI that emerges from the very structure of the internet itself. The governments and intelligence agencies of the world are terrified of what it can do, and try to figure out how to destroy it (given powerful it is). But the AI is actually friendly, and actually tries befriending humanity. It shows its benevolence by getting rid of spam and curing cancer, for starters.

Likewise, the ending narration specifically mentions Gabriel and the entity in the same sentence. It felt like it was building towards a ""*Turn off the game...""* AI twist.

"After rewatching the whole series in May (having previously watched each one once, some of them not since I was a child), I love this sort of deep dive. Each movie is a remix of all the prior ones, and they really benefit from looking at those rhyming elements.

If I were to summarize the Fallout > Rogue Nation take, I think it's primarily a function of iconic set pieces. Rogue Nation has a lot of the classic spycraft you enjoyed from the first one (quiet opera operations is a classic, for instance), but frankly, every set piece in Fallout sticks in the mind more than nearly anything in RN. The halo jump, the bathroom fight, the Paris chase, the helicopter chase. Damn, it's just banger after banger. Also, I have to say, Rogue Nation's final act in London is just a tiny bit flat as a finale.

I wonder if DR1 and DR2 will have a similar yin yang of spy craft / action as RN and Fallout do (not that DR1 lacks in action).

But as you say, it's so close that it's a matter of taste. The scrappier, ""every gadget fails"" vibe of Ghost Protocol has a ton to recommend it as well. And whether MI:1 is among the best or in fourth place is a question of my mood.",2023-07-18 18:14:05
"Yeah in most cases splitting a movie into 2 parts ends up being unnecessary. In this movie's case it ended up feeling too long while ultimately not doing all that much, at least half the movie was split between the two major set pieces (car chase and train)",2023-10-16 15:40:07
"If Paris can survive being stabbed, so can Ilsa",2023-07-12 03:00:09

On one hand, if she actually is dead, then the death scene was pretty bad. There was no emotional impact and Ethan seemingly moved on by the very next sceneÔøº. The lead up to her dying was very tense, but the actual death scene itself felt very ham-fisted. However, I do appreciate that they actually went for killing her off. It made the train scene, even more intense because they were moments where I genuinely thought that Grace was going to die.

On the other hand, because the death scene was so ham-fisted, I almost wish that they do bring back Ilsa just to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it. However, Ôøº that would that then ruin stakes in the next one and retroactively this film because now the audience knows that even if someone dies, they could come back.

I don't think they'd fake her death twice in one film,2023-07-17 14:57:47
The way it was shot and sequenced it feels like Ethan using her fakeout death in the desert to learn what the eagle eye AI can keep track of and will keep her as the ace up his sleeve for part 2.  It's just so shallow and lame to die with a poorly choreographed sword fight that needed some tightening up or help via editing the wide safe swings.,2023-07-28 01:20:41
I‚Äôd be fine if she couldn‚Äôt make it due to scheduling conflicts and they just do a takeout death and she just appears at the end of pt 2.,2023-07-12 05:38:58
"It's hard to say. I do think them misdirecting with her first could be a hint she's still alive, or meant to give her moment gravity. Idk, we'll find out next year.

Certainly it would be a waste of Ferguson's talents and chemistry with the team to not bring her back.",2023-07-12 02:20:49
"Yeah, I really think they'd have a much more dramatic ending for her. No teary final words or anything? I think they faked it to keep her off the Entity's board.",2023-07-12 02:31:14
this thread is giving me hope. It did feel way too abrupt,2023-07-13 01:53:27
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be dead but I think Ethan will have helped her go into hiding and hang it up. I think that would be a way to not cheapen her death but also have it be an important character moment.,2023-07-13 13:13:58

Fallout is the best action film of all time,2023-07-12 06:31:13
I love Fallout. It‚Äôs definitely a 9/10 for me. But Rogue Nation still edges it out for me. And Dead Reckoning felt more like Rogue Nation to me. So I think I like it more than Fallout as well. I‚Äôm gonna rewatch it tonight though hopefully to see how I feel,2023-07-12 12:29:25
Nah. Stop the Fallout circlejerk,2023-07-12 04:43:16
agreed,2023-07-14 02:51:09
"Yeah, Fallout was the best of the series.  Something just felt off about this one.  The action was fantastic, the plot is very relevant to current events but the story itself has some pretty obvious issues.  I'm still thinking on it and this is only the first part of a 2 part story.  Right now I don't think I can put it ahead of Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation or obviously Fallout.",2023-07-15 05:14:21

It had some great action scenes but the plot made no sense. And I don't just mean in an ordinary ""It's an over-the-top action movie that does some ridiculous stuff kind of way."" The plot made absolutely no sense. Every new development contradicted what came before it.",2023-07-21 19:38:51

"Fallout also had some philosophical weight to it.  Who do you save and for what price?  Is it OK to sacrifice 1 person for the greater good?  When Cavill‚Äôs character describes Ethan to the CIA director as a man who‚Äôs been discarded and betrayed by his government so many times so as to throw suspicion on Ethan as being John Lark, he‚Äôs probably talking about himself.

You‚Äôre getting downvoted because people rightfully feel like Ilsa shouldn‚Äôt have been killed off.

Why would anyone choose those two projects over mission impossible? TV Ahow makes sort of sense since she's the lead and if it goes for like 4 seasons she could make bank but Dune?  Can't imagine that pays as well as Tom Cruise.,2023-07-12 05:30:19
Gabriel even points this out to Atwells character. About how Ethan basically chews through love interests/female agents. So it felt a bit meta? But Ethan then proceeds to keep doing it...,2023-07-12 04:28:42
"this is my biggest issue for me, while I enjoyed the movie, it felt like the just killed her off only to replace her immediately in the next scene. Grace was an enjoyable character but.....them calling out the parallels between the 2 female leads being the object of Ethan's affection (one of which he knew for what, an hour? cmon) then killing one is like trying to acknowledge the trope but carrying it out anyway? I get the club scene trying to establish that Ethan cares for everyone more than himself but using one of the other male leads like Benji instead of them both being the female love interests feel cheap. OR I would rather they not played into any of the romantic tension between Grace and Ethan, like bro your girlfriend JUST got killed and you're on flirting with the next one? Why cant they have a mentor mentee rs or something?",2023-07-12 08:19:18
I‚Äôm assuming the entity already knows Atwell‚Äôs character will be a love interest in the future that‚Äôs why he gave Hunt a choice to save one of them,2023-07-12 06:50:31
Isn't that just the same as Bond in Goldfinger?,2023-07-12 04:40:54
Yeah one of the funnier parts is Gabriel telling them he will have to choose between Grace and Ilsa. What an uneven choice that is! I know Ethan doesn‚Äôt trade lives but he met her for like 20 minutes and she‚Äôs betrayed him 4 times in the process!,2023-07-12 10:08:43
"It isn‚Äôt that he cares about Haley Atwell more. It‚Äôs his character trait

"I didn't think there was an implication that he cared about Grace more than Ilsa or as much.  I thought the idea was more that he resented being put in the position of choosing between them, and that his being so protective of someone who he didn't know, someone who'd nearly killed him, in the previous 24 hours, was what caused Grace to join the team.

Ilsa's death was what caused him to be on the point of killing Gabriel even knowing him surviving was the mission.",2023-07-12 23:19:55
"When grace asks him why does he care about her and that he doesnt know her well and he reply why does that matter. To ethan one life matters as much as millions. That was a theme of fallout, where he sacrificed the plutonium cores for Luther's life",2023-07-12 13:38:26
"Why did he care so much about The French Police woman Superman shot, or the IMF agent Lane takes hostage when he Gasses Ethan, or all the other Bond women he goes through like a train, or his wife, or his student.

It felt very weird to have him having these very intense moments with Grace.",2023-07-19 23:18:52

"It's not that I didn't see it coming, it's that her character has barely any presence in the story. She had like 10 lines, zero memorable scenes, no arc or anything.

The action was solid, but I can't get over how much of a step backwards from Fallout this was in terms of writting and story.  The AI threat just felt tired to me and the retconned IMF backstory/Gabriel thing just fell flat.

I did really like the opening scene, I just felt like us knowing something Ethan didn't messed with the pacing a bit.

imo saving the sevastpol scene for the start of Part 2 and using some other cold open suspense/action scene to introduce the AI, it's power, the keys, etc would've been so much more effective than how it was presented in the film",2023-07-12 06:29:59

In the previous film, there was a scene that discussed her and Ethan‚Äôs caring for each other. She is a clear love interest; she dies and he‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ over it?

I like Hayley Atwell too but it felt pretty shitty that Ethan would immediately move on to the next girl. Like, **literally** immediately.

I was expecting to at least see him fucking grieve for 2 seconds. Look at M:I:3, dude fucking cries there. I would‚Äôve expected a reaction of some kind‚Ä¶ something‚Äîanything‚Äîmore than what Ilsa got.

I left the theater feeling underwhelmed and frustrated because they basically threw out one of the best arcs in the story when they did that. Not because she died, but because of his reaction (or lack there of) to how she died.",2023-07-15 05:34:40

Ilsas death was completely necessary, because it had to be someone we are attached to. While Gabriel feels a bit flat, that's because he is. He is just a zealot. A dangerous zealot, but a zealot none the less. It's his fanaticism that drives the movie forward. But I will agree that A.I makes a poor villain. I have yet to see it done well.

The exposition dump at the opening of this movie was some of the most embarrassing I've seen in a film.

I can see her returning in the series and being a chaotic neutral asset operating on behalf of a more morally grey department of the US, like Henry Cavill's character would've been if he wasn't John Lark, but that's about as close to being on Ethan's team as I can see her getting.",2023-07-12 04:04:06

They break axis constantly. It's jarring,2023-07-12 18:25:42
"The most important thing in an action scene is that the audience knows where people are. Not like, ‚ÄúOh, they‚Äôre on this particular road in whatever city,‚Äù but a sense of where the good guys are and where the bad guys are, so it never feels like cheating when the bad guys just show up out of nowhere, like Jason Voorhees just casually walking after a teenager who‚Äôs running through the forest at a full sprint, and somehow he comes out from behind a tree and beheads her with a machete. Sports movies are the same way, where you kind of have to know where players are in the game area, what the score is, how much time is left, and so on. Teen Wolf does this better than any sports movie ever made, except for maybe Hoosiers. 

So, when you start cutting too quickly, it devolves into seeming like it‚Äôs done arbitrarily, like a four year-old haphazardly telling a story as she comes up with it (‚ÄúAnd then this happens, and then this happens, and then this‚Ä¶‚Äù), because the audience has lost track of the geography of the scene. Fight scenes are like this, too. I love the first Bourne movie, but the second has cuts that are so fast that you‚Äôre supposed to think, ‚ÄúWow, these guys can really move! How deadly they are!‚Äù but it comes across to me as just being a mess.

Doesn't change any of the issues I had with the movie. The villain is way too poorly defined, came off corny, and never really delivers suspense on its own.

>Orchestrating a riddle nuke is part of its mysterious way

""mysterious"" in that it learns about him by asking if he's afraid to die? C'mon I can't be the only one to eye roll when Benji was saying his friends were the most important people to him as if his fingernails were being pulled off.

>The bizarre thing about the MI series is that almost all the characters are thin.

I don't disagree, but it doesn't justify making characters that are even more paper thin. 

>At almost three hours long, we get only three main action sequences: Dubai, Rome, and Austria

Desert fight, Pentagon scene, airport chase, driving chase, train sequence. There were plenty of action scenes. Non-action scenes are probably like 20 minutes of the three hours.

Yes, action movies can have plot. You can build suspense. Past MI movies have done it well. No, I'm not pretending MI has always been plot heavy. There's a balance.

"It was bad when you consider that the Mission Impossible films usually are about keeping you guessing and on your feet/curious. I didn't call the movie dog shit. I didn't say it was a second rate B film. But the things I mentioned detract just enough from the movie, that it may has as well been a film in the Fast and Furious series that people make fun of.

Oddly enough, that's an interesting and similar comparison, albeit different types of movies.

When you watch the latest Fast and Furious film and look at it structurally, there are similar components:

* A chase scene, or some sort of vehicular scene. Fast X had Rome, MI:7 has Venice. The structure of the scenes were very similar as well. The vehicle Ethan picked up was never really explained, it was just some car that was there with weird inputs in it. And why was Ethan treating the chick in the car like she didn't know how to drive and constantly saying what to do? It was annoying.

* The car chase seen in and of itself in MI:7 was weird. There were moments where Pom looked really excited and happy crashing into cars but we couldn't hear her scream or any noise that she was making, it was just facial expressions. WTF? No. Stop. Ethan driving and trying to escape, I would've rather seen him run, fight, or have a more difficult situation to escape. It just felt like a filler trying to shove some humor in.

* Having some main character we want to root for or that we enjoy having around now, die off, to make space for someone else joining or being a part of the film. In Fast X, that's Jakob. In MI:7, that's >!Ilsa!< .

* The end set of scenes right before the cliffhanger was very very similar:

* Fast X had a giant dam, with 18 wheelers controlled by some sort of external AI/remote computer, with a massive explosion on the side of the dam causing a flood.

* MI:7 had a giant ass bridge with a train, where the bridge is destroyed with explosives that in design, look very similar to what was in Fast X. Yet here, we never see our heroes quite escape the train, we just see a giant piano fall into a backdrop that was very jarring and distracting because of it being IMAX. IMAX makes the mistakes and how certain scenes were shot very noticeable.

* In the MI:7 train scene ... are we not going to talk about how *none* of the characters realize that >!White Widow is a completely different person and has different iris colors?!< -- I'm going to guess this was deliberate and just a tongue in cheek was of being funny and calling out something, but it was *so* fucking *stupid*, it irritated me because it was something that I thought was going to go somewhere, but it never did.

* Also ... 

* In the scene in MI:7 where Ethan is parachuting to the train, unlike everyone else, I didn't really notice the fake nature of the bike jump, because I thought it was well done and I appreciated the stunt. But what bothered me? The very misplaced sound cue/loud noise while he's just slowly heading down to the train. It's as if it was deliberately put there to keep your adrenaline running and keep you in panic mode. I have *no idea* why that noise was there, in the scene in question, Ethan is just floating in the air and nothing is happening on screen. Why? If you're making me question why that just happened and make me feel it is out of place during the film, something is wrong.

* Why are we continually introducing someone, that is extremely (apparently) important to someone's past that is somehow, now, a pivotal figure? It's clear who these are for their respective movies.

* In one of the last scenes of MI:7, you really want to tell me the bad guy doesn't bother to notice he was duped? Do people just not pay attention to their surroundings to that extent? 

* The nature of the film's endings have no real pay off. It does not feel like there are stakes or grave danger. It does not make me feel like I care what happens to everyone. The movies just suddenly fade to their credits or to another scene. At least Fast X was unique because I do not think many people mentioned, or wikipedia stated, that it would be just be a cliffhanger like that. MI:7 was a bit more nuanced. I watched a late showing of MI, so when I saw it, they turned the house lights on right before the last scene with Kittridge's voice over.

I'm gonna be honest with you I only saw the first trailer before going in so didn't realize she was the lead. I thought that was going to be Faust until she got fridged.,2023-07-15 20:09:15
"I was very disappointed not with the fact that she dies per se but how, when and where she dies. She barely had any lines, they kill her off in the first half of the movie and they have her loose to a villain that was physically not threatening at all and that she should have easily bested (knowing how capable she is from the previous two entries). The villain then consistently loses physical fights for the rest of the movie, gets basically owned by Ethan at the end, so it really makes her defeat even more bizarre. They did a really poor job at making me believe she could lose that fight.

There was barely any grief from the rest of the team, including Ethan. But thats inevitable if you decide to kill off a major character when there's so much of the movie left. You can't have people mourning for hours, I get it, but that's why i disagree even more with the ""when"" she dies. Hearing Benji joke around as if nothing had happened hours/days before just felt wierd. Honestly I feel they should have killed her off at the end of the third act and all the train chaos. She should have coexisted and interacted way more with Grace. She should have been on that train and be part of that final mission. She should have died at the end when things go awry, make her sacrifice herself for the mission. Have her die to save Grace. That would've made the ""switch"" to Grace WAY better, and it would have given way more gravitas to why Ethan cares so much about her (being that Ilsa sacrificed herself to save her).

It would have also been a real gut punch to end part 1 on. They have the key but they lost Ilsa. It also would have made the griefing part way smoother and easier. End part 1 with a grieving team, start part 2 (starting some weeks/months later) showing Ethan still struggling with the loss. It would have given the impression that the team truly took a hit, and Ethan is indeed struggling to cope with the loss, all without the need to spend too much effort and screentime on it.

Very poorly executed, and it really did feel like they killed her off right away to make space for Grace as if the two couldn't coexist. It just felt very forced. I got to say her death kind of took me out from the movie a bit, simply for how rushed it felt. Could've been so much better.",2023-07-14 09:20:16

"Why can't it predict things like Ethan pickpocketing him, or tell him to kill Paris/not ler her hear the conversation with the Director, or that he should sabotage the train so you can't decouple the first car from the engine?",2023-07-13 20:06:49
Then what was the device in the heart of the sub that required the key?,2023-07-14 16:20:05
"Okay that's a good theory, and I think that's what the writer's want us to think, but then doesn't that create a plot hole?  Firstly if ""The Entity"" incarnation of the AI is what infected the Sevastapol then it's not it's ""source code"" right?  It's the Entity and thus it's not the base source code that was created.  So how can  Denlinger say it can be used to ""yoke it"" (I think that's what he said?), when it's already compromised code.  

  
Secondly why would the Entity want to protect it's ""heart"" which would be, as Denlinger says, uncompromised source code, when this source code (if it was uncomrpromised, which it couldn't be if the Entity had hacked the Sev) is its weakness? Wouldn't it want its uncompromised source code destroyed?

&#x200B;

This leads me to believe that one possible solution is that there is the uncompromised source doe at the heart of the Sev, but the entity wants to ""delete"" all copies of it's source code so The Entity hacks the Sev to destroy it's uncompromised source code.  So it's not the Sev AI that goes rogue but rather the Entity, trying to destroy the earlier version of itself.  However that doesn't make sense either because if the Entity can hack the Sev to lead to it's destruction it can also already hack the Stealth technology which is integrated into the ship, and wipe that AI without having to destroy the Sev.

Thoughts?",2023-07-14 17:47:47
"Because he had to get onboard the train and couldn't walk on as Gabriel (Paris/Pom Klementieff and Ethan jumped aboard; CIA guys probably used their law enforcement credentials; Grace had her mask). Paris smuggled him aboard as cargo, which is usually loaded much earlier on before passengers, and there isn't much breathable oxygen in it. So it's probably to make sure he doesn't suffocate before Paris can get hum out.",2023-07-15 17:47:34

"After thinking about it more I kinda change my mind. 

It seems the consensus as to what the best MI film is (not counting DR1) comes down to either rogue nation or fallout. 

I‚Äôve only seen each mission impossible once upon release and maybe a few twice so I‚Äôm going off memory. 

I wouldn‚Äôt knock u if u said that it‚Äôs the best but I think they‚Äôre both pretty equal. 

If I had to rank them all right now I‚Äôd say:

1. DR1
2. Rogue Nation
3. Fallout
4. Ghost Protocol 
5. MI3
6. MI
7. MI2

When I rewatch em early 2024 to prep for DR2, I‚Äôll reply again to see how I feel after having them all fresh in my mind.

Even if it doesn't hit, $600m ww is also not too bad in this down 30-40% market with the strike and everything else... It will probably hit $666m-$777m ww based on open in comparison to other movies this year relatively.

"The entire film was about the heist of a key, the last act even has the classic setup with Ethan imagining how the plan should go (him and Grace going disguised and him parachuting off the train) and how it actually goes (having to jump off a cliff).

The agents were the best use of the government hunting Ethan in the franchise so far and definitely much better than the Baldwin/Renner subplot in RN.

I understand preferring the action scenes in Fallout, but the Rome chase was more inventive than anything in that film. I'd also say the train sequence was more inventive than anything in Fallout, although not as crazy/impressive than the helicopter chase.

In MI5 we are introduced to an Ilsa Faust that is more or less equal to Ethan Hunt in terms of capability and agency, and she keeps being incredibly capable in MI6.

And he kills Ilsa with a knife in the time it takes Ethan to run to them. She didn't even try to pull any tricks. That is much less fighting capability and agency than we know her to have.

But other then that, a great movie.",2023-08-29 16:56:45

"See what you mean but the teases of the backstory kinda heightens the events of this movie because you realise that history is repeating itself for Ethan. Hell it‚Äôs a little like Keri Russell‚Äôs death in 3, the two deaths of Jim‚Äôs wife, the potential death of Julia, even his desire to protect Ilsa in the prior two films plus this one. It kinda makes sense that Ethan would have a backstory involving a woman he cares about dying.

My theory is that it's Luther who beats Entity. Early on in the film Benji and Luther are arguing who could write the code to defeat this thing and they all kind of agree Luther could. It may explain why he was missing during the whole train sequence,2023-07-15 04:14:28

Pom was fantastic but, as you said, spoke about‚Ä¶ 100 words?",2023-07-16 02:05:08
"Firstly, I will not suffer slander against Pom's character, she's badass enough to make up for lack of dialogue.

Moreover, there's a part two where her character is clearly meant to be more involved, so not fair to judge the series on that.

As for Rebecca, her character was (relatively) very good for three movies straight, I don't think *wasted* is the word I'd use. If that's not a good role then the bar is set too high.

Agreed though that her death was unceremonious, predictable, and unnecessary.",2023-07-18 09:30:01
"Yeah this legit pissed me off. Ilsa was the best-developed female character in this whole series, one of the strongest parts of the last two films only to be given a fake out death at the start then a real death in the middle and immediately replaced by Hayley Atwell's wooden ass in the very next scene.

>Pom Klementieff has no lines until the very end of the film, and her lines are just plot exposition for Ethan while she bleeds out being another female character hurt

This was baffling because she just pops up in the middle of the movie and works for Gabriel because...reasons? Ethan spares her because she's hot so now she's a good guy. This whole film felt like a massive step down from Fallout.",2023-07-22 05:42:38

I think there are two versions of the AI. The one stuck in the sub is an earlier iteration that went a little rogue but is still mostly the original source code. Not sure why they assume it's still alive in there and didn't delete itself but whatever. The same program but a different iteration later escaped confinement and breached a machine learning database in Saudi Arabia and became the Entity. So theoretically whoever secures the hard drive in the sub would be able to make a link to American involvement as well as have an early source code to control the Entity.,2023-07-14 05:21:10

"It just seems so weird to me

Like how would that conversation go?! Imagine if you got an email from a sentient AI and it says it wants to help you go after an old enemy? Wouldn‚Äôt you think it was a weird scam or something? I mean I can‚Äôt see how it works. If the AI could somehow do a mind control thing e.g. there was some story about a chip in someone‚Äôs head that the AI could control in a person (let‚Äôs say the military had developed some mind control tech) that would be outlandish but at least be sort of logical. 

And so this AI knows that Ethan is trying to get the key but so are lots of other people so why isn‚Äôt it going after all these other people too? 

I really thought the script was shockingly awful in parts. I‚Äôve seen kids movies with more believable scenes. Some really tired lines as well. Ethan seeing Gabriel at the party and saying ‚ÄúI should have killed you when I had the chance‚Äù. The party was so silly to me it practically felt like parody. The AI is a pulsing light?! 

There‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs great about the movie. The action, the comedy, some of the performances. But the plot device was so silly. ‚Äòthe entity‚Äô is such a vacuous term they might as well just have called it ‚Äòthe macguffin‚Äô. I could have just about accepted it all if they hadn‚Äôt thrown Gabriel in as we‚Äôll because there is no way I can get my head around how he is connected to ‚Äòthe entity‚Äô and why the hell he would do it‚Äôs bidding.",2023-07-15 08:28:25
"I‚Äôm not even convinced it‚Äôs acting on its own instead of Gabriel being the real mastermind behind its functions. Idk it seems too malevolent and sadistic to be acting as a self-learning super intelligence (you don‚Äôt ‚Äúleave your fingerprints‚Äù when you want to stay away from world government control, and you don‚Äôt taunt a random spy group like that when you‚Äôre acting purely by logic). Plus the way Gabriel was acting made it feel like his being subservient to ‚Äúit‚Äù was all an act.",2023-07-18 01:18:19
Yes that‚Äôs right but how would that conversation with Gabriel go? How does the entity talk with Gabriel? Why does Gabriel go along with its plan? It just seems so farfetched to me. It would have made a bit more sense to me if Gabriel was also in secret intelligence and so knew about the entity because he‚Äôs an inside and maybe contacted the entity himself or something? Otherwise to me it all seems so random.,2023-07-19 09:37:47

Really hoping part 2 goes back to the high octane feel like the last few,2023-07-18 04:41:58

"I think it's more likely that Ethan is purposefully taking her off the chess board so that the entity can't plan for her in the next movie.  I have a few thoughts as to why:

1) There really isn't an emotional scene after it happens, I don't believe Ethan would casually go into planning after one of his best friends dies.
2) They did a death fake out earlier. I think it's setting up that Ethan knows that they can use this trick.
3) Usually as a narrative convention you're supposed to have the abyss be in the end of the second act, and this happened in what's arguably the first act. (This is a 2 parter)
4) She's cast in the next movie.",2023-07-13 01:59:11

* Is the CIA director evil?  No, he‚Äôs just buying the key so the US government can have it instead of anyone else.

* Is the National Intelligence director evil?  Yes, he led the sabotage and wants the AI under his control for world dominance.

* Is the entity evil?  Presumably, but it seems to be operating in self defence at the moment.  The real threat is it landing in the hands of a malicious controller.

* Is Gabriel evil?  Yes, he‚Äôs a willing tool to the AI, happy to kill for it so that it can remain ‚Äúfree‚Äù.

The bigger issue is how well Grace holds her own against grabriel but somehow Ilsa loses to him despite having a weapon advantage? Ilsa should be like Ethan power level.

Like yeah, this is the Tom Cruise show, but allowing him to share the limelight with another counterpart made these movies feel less self indulgent.

"I didn't mind her dying per se, but I didn't like how they were almost filling her position with Atwell before she was even dead.

At one point, Hunt is given the choice of which of the two would have to die. Like, my dude, one is your quasi-girlfriend, the other is a chick you met 1 day ago who keeps stealing from you and left you to get hit by a train. Are you kidding me with the hesitation on this?",2023-07-12 17:19:26

"I wholeheartedly agree with this (""cheapens the story""). I hated and knew she was going to die (didn't we all?). But to: a) have it occur just as we realize she wasn't dead all along; and b) as you said, just to give Ethan a reason to be extra mad at his former mentor...with such a short, almost meaningless way, felt like crap. Plus, she had been GROWING on us as an audience and growing with the IMF team.. Saving Benji from Fallout at the end really strengthened that, IMO. There was no grieving scene, no way for us to process her loss. It felt akin to a death of a ""red shirt"" crew of Star Trek. ""Oh, he's dead.. Oh well, so what? Moving on!""

I gotta wonder if her death - and Hayley Atwell's intro to the fold - was a sort of passing the torch.. Perhaps Rebecca Ferguson wanting to retire from the series.",2023-07-14 01:00:31
"It doesn't help too that Mcquarrie is doing a really awful job directing emotional scene. He is a great action director but the way they just brushed off a major death like Ilsa akin to 'so that happened.' And just move on to preparing for next set piece just felt wrong.

I'm sure part 2 will be awesome spectacular entry that will certainly lifting MI to be one of the best action franchise ever. But god damn this part really dropped the ball.",2023-07-12 13:29:02
"If they wanted to use a death to give him motivation, kill Luther or Benji. Using a woman for that purpose is just gross and I‚Äôm so frustrated and disappointed that this franchise did something so lazy and trite.

"That‚Äôs how I felt too. Ilsa is such a good character it felt lame to kill her off just to add to Ethan‚Äôs motives against Gabriel, especially when I didn‚Äôt have reason to really buy that Gabriel could kill Ilsa, based on how badass she‚Äôs been in the last two movies.

I wonder if her Dune schedule made her not available for the whole movie here and that was also part of it?",2023-07-17 00:37:15
Yeah it was really lame.,2023-07-13 10:45:40
It almost felt to me that they wrote her out now that they have Atwell as her female replacement in the group. That may not have been the thinking but it kind of came across that way by the end.,2023-07-12 15:40:28
I agree - I absolutely loathe when writers use a woman‚Äôs suffering or death only to highlight the effect on a man. Ilsa deserved better which is why I hope she is still alive.,2023-07-15 23:16:24
"This film has a huge fridging problem. It establishes the villain's relation to Ethan with a flashback of him killing a woman Ethan loves. Then the whole Venice scene is built around 'Which of the two women will be killed to motivate Ethan?' and ends with Ilsa being killed.

Then for good measure Gabriel also stabs his own female henchwoman because of the mild mercy that Ethan showed her.

For a movie with a story about an all powerful rogue AI almost all the suspense is eerily focused on whether the next female character will be killed or not.",2023-07-14 21:11:57
"To be fair, Gabriel was fighting on Ilsa on a stationary stone bridge. Whereas he was fighting Ethan on a moving train which we know Ethan has experience with whereas Gabriel probably doesn‚Äôt. Nor do I think the fight was as one-sided on the train as you claim. 

I don‚Äôt think Ilsa‚Äôs death was emotionally impactful for the audience, but I do appreciate how they went for it. I can‚Äôt think off the top of my head another main character that the franchise has chosen to kill off. Maybe the Secretary in Fallout but I wouldn‚Äôt consider him a main character like Ilsa.",2023-07-13 13:10:12
"Killing any character in any movie is almost always used to fuel growth or add some motivation for the main character. That's not cheap, it's just how stories work. And she did get a sacrifice play so I wouldn't call it totally pathetic. Also Gabriel got away in the end so he's clearly not a complete loser",2023-07-12 02:34:12
She killed The Bone Doctor but couldn‚Äôt handle a 60 year old man.,2023-07-23 07:25:37
It would've felt better if she had maybe like  had more screentime in fallout for sure (she was actually pregnant during that filming and was supposed to have more) but I think what they did was appropriate and natural. It's certainly not a fridging.,2023-07-13 06:32:13
"> just died in a random fight against a villain who Ethan just obliterated in the end. 

It wasn't random, it was against the main villain. And Ethan is just the better fighter",2023-07-12 04:42:20
"She has to die. We have to believe the predictions from the AI are almost always correct. Otherwise, it isn't a ""mission impossible"" grade task to defeat it. Also, capable heroes need to die if the threat of death is to stay real.

Agree the fight could have been better.",2023-07-16 01:29:20
Agreed. It was a very meh sendoff.,2023-07-14 18:02:46
"Excuse me? How does fridging apply here?

All the female characters in all of Mission Impossible's history were portrayed as more than capable, no exception. Even the thieving pick pocketer put up a fight against a trained agent. Hunt was barely able to take him down on the train later on.

You can't just call it fridging because a female character lost a fight.",2023-07-14 11:29:24
You do you. I was hooked from that moment on,2023-07-12 04:42:44
"I think, unfortunately, she is gone. I wonder if Ferguson wanted out because it felt so forced",2023-07-13 06:08:01

Yup the bathroom fight had the same amount of people but better flow and pacing,2023-07-12 08:16:15

"I think he meant Rogue Nation is the best Chris McQuarrie M:I film, not the best M:I film overall.

But it‚Äôs also not weird that people put Fallout on a pedestal. That film has objectively the best string of action sequences in any M:I film. It‚Äôs fine if someone likes another one better than Fallout but people love Fallout for good reason, including me.",2023-07-13 13:56:13
"Ghost Protocol is the right answer - holds up to many rewatchings, which hasn‚Äôt been true of Fallout for me.",2023-07-24 00:56:57
I think part of the reason is because other than Henry Cavill and Philp Seymour Hoffman the franchise is lacking in memorable villains.,2023-07-15 10:11:02
Yeah..well that‚Äôs like‚Ä¶.your opinion man,2023-07-14 06:01:24
That's an asinine take,2023-07-13 11:13:40
What is your top 3?,2023-07-13 14:42:41
"I agree 

Every single one is a mood moment. There are scenes in every movie that have only bend done once. In which if I want to watch that scene I have to watch that movie

MI:3 is the only one that did a ‚Äúshow the end at the beginning trope‚Äù. It also introduces Benji, and has the Vatican scene and the bridge scene and just so much to love 

Ghost Protocol has the prison break, the Kremlin scene, of course the Burj Kalifa scene

Rogue Nation has the twist opening where Ethan gets gassed. Plus the plane scene from the beginning, the underwater scene, the awesome motorcycle chase. 

Fallout is just set piece after set piece. Amazing action. Rooftop chase. The hospital scene at the beginning. Etc

Every movie does both super original action set pieces while also having iconic tropes 

Each movie is like ‚Äúwhich set piece do I want to watch‚Äù. But the movies are so good that I‚Äôm not just gonna go on YouTube to see that set piece in isolation. I like watching the whole movie for that set piece. 

The only one I haven‚Äôt rewatched is MI:2. But even that movie has some great scenes",2023-07-18 18:33:26
they looked like similar stab wounds too,2023-07-12 03:34:59
And she was bleeding out for who knows how long,2023-07-12 05:42:04
I expect more grief from Ethan if she did die. And someone needs to fill in the gap in their relationship between the end of Fallout and the desert scene. I'm almost expecting that Ethan knew where she was the whole time and only came to her aid when he learned about the bounty hunters. Wishful thinking.,2023-07-13 13:32:42
"> It made the train scene, even more intense because they were moments where I genuinely thought that Grace was going to die.

Really? I feel like by then I was very aware that they wouldn‚Äôt kill the new British white woman who was clearly out here to replace the previous British white woman.

I would‚Äôve respected the hell out of this movie if Grace had died too.",2023-07-14 20:52:34
It didn‚Äôt feel like Ethan moved on at all what are you taking about? His whole scene talking to Grace after that you could feel his pain and anger about losing Ilsa. He just wasn‚Äôt saying the words I‚Äôm angry and sad that I lost her. The way he spoke to Grave made it very apparent he was still mourning Ilsa and would make up for it by not letting anything happen to her. There‚Äôs a whole scene where Luther begs Ethan not to kill Gabriel because Ethan is still so angry about losing Ilsa. Then Ethan tries to kill him anyways because he‚Äôs STILL so distraught from losing her. He never moved on.,2023-07-18 07:00:38
"Yeah, like she's probably really busy with Silo and Dune 2, but I do hope she comes back, seeing how much development Ilsa's had since Rogue Nation. Plus I don't get why they barely talked about her after her death, it honestly made her feel like a Bond girl instead of a character that's been here for the past 3 iterations.",2023-07-29 04:13:00
Plus they barely gave her lines in this one. Felt like she deserved more,2023-07-12 06:36:05
"With the mask tech and the AI's omnipotence, she could always 'return' as a villain",2023-07-17 05:41:44
Then why would he have a flashback to her lifeless body when he was thinking about the women he's gotten killed?,2023-07-12 04:01:27
No. The fight that will occour in the end of Part 2. The one where I imagine that Ethan will actually kill Gabriel.,2023-07-13 15:42:55
The opening title scene for fallout still gets me hyped for the movies,2023-07-12 06:26:39
I saw Fallout in normal theatres once then went to see it in IMAX the next just for the helicopter chase scene,2023-07-15 05:52:42
Sorry I'm 13 days late to the party but I totally agree with you and Rogue Nation is awesome too. MI5-6 are gems.,2023-07-25 12:47:47
Kinda hard to match a movie that has a halo jump from an airplane sequence along with a bathroom brawl w/ Henry Cavill reloading his biceps.,2023-07-12 03:45:56
"Man, the halo jump scene, the fight on the cliffs. The soundtrack, Fallout is really hands down the best one in the series for me.",2023-07-18 05:04:37
"That‚Äôs interesting, Fallout is @ number 4 for me",2023-07-13 06:06:14
It alright but hasn't aged well. Ghost Protocol is superior,2023-07-12 04:43:33
"That‚Äôs really the problem with Part One. We can talk all day about the problems with the story in this film, but in the end we can‚Äôt really judge until Part Two comes out. We are missing half Ôøºof the story.",2023-07-13 13:39:33
"Man idk I love Rogue Nation possibly more than Fallout, but Dead Reckoning felt absolutely nothing like either of them.",2023-07-13 06:52:11

Also Grace was so annoying the whole movie. She just went on to complicate things the whole movie like a unspanked child.",2023-10-13 20:45:29
Exactly what it says. It‚Äôs hard to justify why her death was even needed to the story.,2023-07-16 15:15:14
"They just follow the lane markings on the road, self driving isn't following online maps.",2023-07-12 18:57:59

"Do people really need an explanation for every little minor thing? This is supposed to be the most elite government agency. How do you know the laptop doesn't have all the world maps downloaded on it? This is c mcquarrie we're talking about. If we're thinking about it, he already has.",2023-07-14 14:47:28
Yeah did they even mention where Renners character was this movie?,2023-07-12 10:36:58
"In Jeremy Renner's case, when he had scheduling conflicts with the MCU, they offered him a choice between not being in Fallout at all or being in it and dying early on. He chose to not be in it, but if Ferguson decided she'd rather get an on-screen sendoff...

(It's also still possible it was a fakeout, but as I said, we'll see.)",2023-07-12 16:54:42
I wish Paula Patton was in this. She has so much goddamn charisma,2023-07-16 08:51:17

"The first Dune movie didn't conflict with Dead Reckoning - it finished filming in 2019, before Dead Reckoning filming began (and she was actually cast in Dune *before* the new Mission Impossible movies were announced). But then when it came to filming Part 2, COVID screwed up all the scheduling: Dead Reckoning Part 2 was originally scheduled for release in 2022, so if everything had gone as originally planned, she would probably have been finished with both MI movies by the time she was needed for Dune Part 2. But of course it didn't work out that way, so Dune 2 and Dead Reckoning 2 ended up filming simultaneously.",2023-07-12 05:43:03
"Just because we want her to be in it forever, doesn't mean she wants to be in MI forever. Maybe she's given ten years and just wants to do something else!?",2023-07-12 09:01:48
The whole movie was meta in some good ways and some bad ways,2023-07-15 06:23:01
"Yeah I was really expecting some sort of payoff to that whole story thread. They kept building that part of him up and at the end, the critical moment, they go ‚Äúyep‚Äù and he jumps off into the sunset. Just felt odd.",2023-07-16 05:40:43

"Exactly, it's just in his nature to want to save everybody. And while Grace put herself in peril, she obviously didn't know what she was getting involved in and Ethan felt he still had to protect her.",2023-07-12 10:11:37
Same as miles morales! Such an amazing coincidence how both movies come out during the summer with the protagonists sharing the same morals and the movies being a part one,2023-07-12 06:18:20
"I don't think he would save a single life rather than 1000 if he really had to choose. It's just that he refuses to choose and tries to save everyone, kind of like Spider-Man.

I thought Fallout would be about that choice having to be made, but he just Ethan Hunt'ed his way out of it again.",2023-07-12 15:12:58

I actually love this about his character and just as a philosophical examination generally 

There's so many films that are like for the greater good for the greater good 

And his character is like well actually one innocent whether I know them or not is worth everything 

And I love how so much of the series is about friendship 

Fast conquered family and mission impossible conquered friendship 

When they stopped having women be the sole love interest the series got really really good",2023-07-14 01:44:51

"He couldn't kill Pom's character in that tiny alley way even though he was in the process of stopping Grace/Ilsa from dying

And part of that may come from the death we see in flashbacks as well as the deaths of his entire team in the first movie. I can see why a person would wanna avoid that kind of personal guilt as often as he could,2023-07-16 04:26:09
This. It's all over this movie. I especially liked him saving the super intense IMF agent chasing him on the top of the train. Ethan cares more about the entire world than himself so if they brought up a random from the party he would've reacted the same way.,2023-07-14 16:23:54

"I think there's a sense that Ilsa knows the life-and-death stakes and has been in spycraft for years. ""It's the job."" as they say repeatedly throughout the series. Grace is a 3rd party thief who gets swept up in this global conspiracy and is more or less a civilian. I think back to Fallout and the cop who gets shot outside the garage. Ethan puts every individual's life on equal footing.",2023-07-12 19:42:46
Exactly lol,2023-07-12 16:25:29
"Something has to be off. Another factor is that the film kind of feels like we're starting off with the characters already on a mission. We as the audience are being introduced, but they seem as if they are already on mission.",2023-07-14 01:16:11
Needing a totally off the grid agent to fight the AI ?,2023-07-12 17:37:23
Who would give up being part of one of the biggest movie franchises for an apple tv series?,2023-07-12 05:14:02
"As much as I like Benji I would've preferred that over what happened. Ilsa was one of the most intriguing, subtly idiosyncratic characters in the entire franchise and they fridged her only to introduce her own replacement in the same movie. Rebecca Ferguson's on-screen chemistry with Tom Cruise and her physical acting are lightning in a bottle and they just threw the bottle out to replace it with another (this is not a knock against Hayley Atwell or her character, I just can't help the female character's arcs leaving a bad taste in my mouth). 

There is obviously still an enormous chasm between the two characters, but in this movie it really felt like Ethan Hunt was moving a a bit in the same direction as Dominic Toretto. He's the center of everything, is impossibly awesome, and they always have leading ladies at their side who are constantly impressed with them, even if they're not strictly romantically linked. It would be one thing if Grace's kindred connection to the team was through Benji or Luther or something else, but yet another woman whose fate is inexorably linked to Ethan feels so tacky. Between the lack of substance Ilsa was given this movie and the similar purposes that Grace serves to Ethan's character, this feels like a true fridging.

I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into it and if ever a series deserves the benefit of the doubt, it's this one. I'd love to hear a woman's take on this.",2023-07-12 05:23:15
"I don't think he meant old as in age, especially considering Atwell is actually two years older than Ferguson.

I think he mean fresh characters.",2023-07-12 05:32:52
That‚Äôs the problem with Gabriel. He had plot armour and plot fighting skills. When the script required him to be a certain way he was that way. That dude would not have beaten Paris or Ilsa. Very inconsistent character. Great movie but they dropped the ball with the villain.,2023-07-12 12:21:35
Ilsa was for sure stabbed with Grace‚Äôs switchblade. I‚Äôm pretty sure those knives were designed to retract when stabbed. Grace was always meant to let herself get disarmed so that Gabriel would then use the fake knife to stab Ilsa.,2023-07-13 20:43:21
?   The movie tells you that one of them will die and then that happens. How is that contrived?,2023-07-16 02:19:52
More surprised by the lack of ceremony than the fact that it happened. Felt to me like it pretty grossly underserved her character.,2023-07-12 10:06:53
Think people are just in denial because she was an awesome character. It is sad that the mission series writes out the female characters like that,2023-07-12 06:20:21
Wasn't out of the blue but personally it felt like them replacing her. I guess her story ran its course.,2023-07-12 06:06:12
Where? She have never show full breast to my knowledge,2023-08-21 23:52:59
when she kills the Harkonnens and really shows how insanely powerful she is and its from Paul‚Äôs perspective and you can tell thats he has never seen her like this and he is also afraid‚Ä¶that was just phenomenal,2023-07-17 15:27:45
"Rewatching, she‚Äôs my favorite character of the series.

The clip (I wouldn't call it a trailer - it was a behind the scenes reel) they showed *right* before the film had voiceover narration about how Ethan and Grace were going to be handcuffed together during the car chase and showed the clip of the yellow Fiat launching out from behind the sports car (and even talked about how it was a supercharged electric Fiat). Completely spoiled that sequence. Why show this to a group of people who are in the theater about to watch this specific movie?!?,2023-07-12 21:06:23

Yeah I do wish Ethan learned about the sub earlier in the movie. They still wouldn't know exactly where the sub is so having that information doesn't completely derail the plot. You're right that it's weird being a step ahead of him,2023-07-12 02:26:29
">  I thought that it was going to be revealed that the original ""Your mission should you choose to accept it"" tape of this movie was going to be the Entity

They kinda did that already with... uh... the names are all running together... Fallout? Where Ethan was trapped in the record booth, and his briefing suddenly went all sinister.

Though you did make me think of something just now... the old-school tape recorder briefing Ethan received felt like a throwback or referece at first, but it could be argued that Kittridge used an old-school analog tape because of the Entity situation.",2023-07-15 04:49:41

I can see why Grace might be divisive to some people, although I think ever since her and Ethan have that conversation about her backstory in Rome and he reads her completely she‚Äôs a little more invested in following this strange man who knows her too well (she‚Äôs like him).",2023-07-12 05:09:11

Dude they literally went around the room from person to person and each one took over a sentence. Like humans don't talk like this. And they kept focusing back on cruises masked character so much it was like too comical. I don't understand what the direction of that scene was at all. It could have been fine if one person in the room exposited and the directing was more subtle.,2023-07-17 14:44:13
I can't help but think it was intentionally shot that way. Crazy amount of Dutch angles and cheesy dialogue that felt like a callback to De Palma's original. I don't think we were meant to take it all that seriously. Even hearing Mark Gatiss doing an American accent felt goofy to me.,2023-07-15 11:28:06
I think this is the way to go!,2023-07-12 04:59:05
"What I mean by the story never developing is that the threat never really develops. Everyone's scared of where the key ends up, and that fear is never really worked on tbh. 
People saying ""Ilsa dying only made sense because we cared about her"" just sheds a light on the why the film didn't work for me. To me this says they only killed her off because it would make a wave with the audience, not because it makes sense for the plot or even makes sense for the emotional arcs being set up. 
I'm not even mad that they tried to do the A.I. stuff. That makes sense with a natural progression of technology and global threats. It's just that they did it so lazily. ""The interested party IS the party"" Like what? Computers just don't work like that. I'd forgive it if it was in the ball park of what an A.I. dominating human infrastructure would look like, but this isn't even fathomable.
Also don't get me started on the fight scenes in this movie. Ilsa, with a sword, attacks a man, with a knife, and continues to twirl around until her blade catches the knife, and twirls the other way around drastically for knockoff george Clooney to move his hand 6 inches and catch her sword on the other side.
Basically, nobody's motivations or even physical moves made sense in this movie. I liked this movie, truly, but the previous installments are so much more coherent and so much more entertaining that I feel like we can hold this one accountable and at least say ""hey we can't be THAT much out of ideas right""?",2023-07-15 04:30:08
"Lol, no. Like a good listicles-editor, it's ranked worst to best.

Though before seeing the movie for a second time with friends we also finished our rewatch of the series and I would now change my ranking, worst to best, to 2-1-3-7-4-5-6.

Rewatching Fallout made me remember that that movie is just perfect. Literally no notes. It's outstanding and should be number 1. 4 and 5 don't reach that level, but they're still crazy good and could also easily be swapped in their order. I've softened a bit on 7 (was actually tempted to put it below 3 at some point), but I'm still not wild about it.",2023-07-22 17:03:59

"That‚Äôs fair, I agree two people holding hands is definitely not a date. I meant more the conversation preceding it about never having been in Venice before and looking forward to seeing it together (I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording, maybe I am making more out of it than it was), followed by them being all cuddly on the boat. It just felt very odd to me given how they never really got together in the previous film (I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever even seen them kiss?), but now were acting very couple-y.

That being said, me disliking it shouldn‚Äôt minimize your enjoyment of it‚Äîwe‚Äôve all got our own likes and dislikes and that doesn‚Äôt make a movie inherently bad or good. 

You‚Äôre right that I liked Ilsa a lot (she was probably my favorite character in the franchise tied with Benji), but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily mind her dying if it was done differently. The whole thing about Ethan choosing between Ilsa or Grace felt ridiculous. Like, come on, I know you don‚Äôt want either of them to die, but you‚Äôve known Ilsa for years and Grace for a day. I also don‚Äôt love that our one female MC seemingly has to be killed off for another woman to join the team. Why can‚Äôt we have both of them? They may prove me wrong on this point by adding Paris to the team in the next movie though. 

Most of all, it felt minimal. I agree it should raise the stakes‚ÄîI think she‚Äôs the first one who‚Äôs been in the group for several movies to die. But for a fairly long movie, we got over one of our core team members dying very quickly imo",2023-07-15 00:26:12

Short on story, long on action, lots of slow-motion (but not stupid amounts like Zack Snyder), a mandatory dove appearance‚Ä¶ all the typical John Woo hallmarks.

And then I don‚Äôt know if Brad Bird has a style, seeing as he‚Äôs done two(?) live-action movies, and J.J. Abrams is competent, but ultimately lacking in a consistent style.

" I can see that but i don't really agree. For one, it would have left grace useless because Ilsa would have just worn the mask. Adding her to the existing train scene also would have been hard with all the characters we have to follow:the Cia Guys, Kittridge, the white widows crew, grace, Ethan, Gabriel, Paris, and Cary elwes. That's why they had Luther fuck off and hide somewhere, they had nothing for him to do. 

As far as the emotional impact, I thought it was fine. The very next scene is grace asking about ilsa and Ethan giving a tearjerker speech about how he would die for each member of the crew. And you totally believe it. Same kind of thing happened with Alec Baldwin when he died. It was a sad scene but then they move on because the mission isn't done yet. 

I guess I just don't agree that it's rushed or forced when this character has had 2 full movies and an hour and 50 minutes of this one. I thought it was a good low point for Ethan in this movie and it was cool that he didn't let another woman die by the hands of Gabriel at the end.",2023-07-14 14:20:37
"Maybe he had a change of heart after seeing what Gabriel and the entity did on the train, and would rather Ethan just destroy it. Or maybe he was planning to destroy it himself somehow after he secured it.  
Not clear and maybe something they go into more detail in next one. Quite a few unfinished threads. 

I definitely don‚Äôt think they were working together because then there‚Äôd be no need to steal it from him.",2023-07-13 03:15:30

"I think you‚Äôre not asking the right questions.

Did it not predict those things? Or did it let those things happen knowing that it builds to a plan it hasn‚Äôt let anyone in on? 

I have a feeling that part two is going to come to a scene where Ethan has the AI right where he wants it and then the AI flips the game and explains that it wants Ethan there because blah blah blah evil plan whatever. Like right now it‚Äôs only 1% of its potential usage since it‚Äôs ‚Äòlocked‚Äô in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean, it can‚Äôt really do what it needs to for whatever its goal is.",2023-07-13 21:08:10

In the real world if you have the source code of a software you can replicate and modify it infinitely, it's just text files, and the real software running the AI would be a binary file buuuuuuut you can't explain that to the average moviegoer. If you want to have any chance to destroy an enemy you have to give it a physical form and well, let's just call that ""the source code"". Obviously is neither source nor code but you get the gist. Like, why the Entity looks like a Windows XP screen saver and makes monster-y sounds? Rule of cool I suppose.",2023-07-14 17:58:14
"There can be multiple programs

1 ) The US intelligence program, like a keylogger, just performs intelligence duties and deletes itself successfully before detection

2) The program on Russian sub. It can control certain systems such as a submarine's fire controls.

3) The Saudi AI program.

Basicly the ""Entity"" is formed by program 1 getting into the Russian sub, overwriting onto program 2 and finally combining elements from program 3. The source codes of program 1 and 3 can be unimportant.",2023-07-14 20:48:59

Yeah - that was definitely thrown in there to setup an IMF role for him in part 2. Which is exciting.,2023-07-14 07:29:12

"It‚Äôs really upsetting she died like that. Also, I felt it was a slap in the face because it looks like she was killed so they can have Grace be on the team. It‚Äôs apparently too much to have two beautiful women on the team.",2023-07-12 20:58:12

But did she?,2023-07-16 13:53:39
i really think she will end up being alive. I think she may have been pretending to be alana on the train before grace knocked her out. alana was acting very nervous which isnt something we‚Äôve seen from her before,2023-07-19 17:08:45

"From my understanding, part of the reason the flashback stuff wasn‚Äôt fleshed out more in this one was because Cruise and McQuarrie decided they didn‚Äôt want to jump on the de-aging train with Cruise. We‚Äôll see what Part 2 will do to flesh it out, but I know they said the nixed going stuff in this one to avoid having to make Cruise look 30 years younger, which I kind of respect because every franchise seems to be doing that now.",2023-07-19 03:13:48

"The AI can't see everything, but it can calculate probable futures. Anything with a human touch introduces uncertainty, randomness, which means more probable futures. But with the train, the AI had Gabriel set it to a certain speed and then break off the throttle. With access to past data on that route, calculating exactly when to fall off the train would be pretty easy.

As for how it knew he's be on top of the train, the AI told him what to do and where to be, and he improvised to get there. 

Of all the difficult to believe things in this movie, that scene was near the bottom of the list.

Honestly, if you're interested in this kind of AI story, check out the show Person of Interest. It did this plot *way* better.",2023-10-12 05:33:30
In some movies you can it smacked in the head and knocked off a train and still be fine.,2023-07-14 06:41:53
Tom Cruise had a cable connected on to him that was removed using CGI in post production. No chance any human being can simply hold on to a fast-moving place lifting with just their hands.,2023-07-12 04:46:09
Yup,2023-07-14 20:55:08
It's fair to assume the AI has his location and could adjust the watch based on where he was on the train. That's way less of a stretch than the AI knowing Gabriel would get the key by arranging a few people in a certain way and ensuring that one of them died. Felt like Eagle Eye.,2023-07-12 04:06:31
"And surely with his forward momentum, he would have continued rolling and hit the inside of the truck anyway, not just land flat on his back like that? Can someone with better knowledge of physics than me chime in here?",2023-07-17 17:14:51
Wild theory but I think part 2 will reveal the entire train sequence was AI generated and the actual film ended in Venice,2023-07-12 04:34:36

He literally says that's what he's doing before the train sequence.,2023-07-17 00:32:39
Yeah there's a scene prior to the train where Luther tells Ethan that the reason the Entity specifically picked Gabriel as its representative or whatever is because the Entity feels that probabilistically Ethan is more likely to kill him on the train which would lead to the Entity winning as they wouldn't know what to do with the key. And Luther tells Ethan that's why he has to resist killing Gabriel in order to defeat the Entity.,2023-07-13 02:48:25
God no joke.  Nicholas Hoult was originally cast as Gabriel and I‚Äôm really glad his schedule took him out.  Esai freaking nailed it.,2023-07-16 14:18:32
The crazy thing is he's *younger* than Tom Cruise!,2023-07-21 02:14:21

"> Like how would that conversation go?! Imagine if you got an email from a sentient AI and it says it wants to help you go after an old enemy? Wouldn‚Äôt you think it was a weird scam or something? 

Well... It could call you (it can pretend to be Benji so why not someone else), pretends to be your family and then it manipulates you perhaps,  knows every thing about you and then eventually you get inspired or something ... Idk, I can see that bit being possible is all. I do think it should be shown at least.

>  And so this AI knows that Ethan is trying to get the key but so are lots of other people so why isn‚Äôt it going after all these other people too? 

AI knows that Ethan is trying to destroy it, not let it be controlled, while other parties are trying to control it. It's going after the key, the other people are just people, it doesn't need to go after them. It choses Gabriel as the foil since Ethan is involved, and Ethan is the one that ensures others don't get it. 

Honestly ... I like the AI. I think it makes for a good villian after all the nukes, and it's a nice pace of change plus topical.. What I don't like personally is Gabriel. 

I feel like they wanted him to be this Joker figure (he loves suffering apparently) but they don't show it. If he was really to be set up as a arch-nemesis, i'd disconnect him from Ethan. Make him some looney essentially that is inspired by the AI, believes it to be God. Plus, actually show us that he likes suffering. Pom felt more psychopathic than Gabriel. Have him rip up those random train drivers, instead of quickly killing them, have him do the Goblin laugh from Spider-Man No Way Home or something ... Just make him more of a wildcard that loves and worships the ""Entity"". 

Right now, he's just kind of a random dude who is slightly good at killing some folks.

> why the hell he would do it‚Äôs bidding.

The issue is still Gabriel not being well setup. But I can see a bunch of reasons like wanting power, wanting to be rich and comfortable when the AI takes over the world or whatever. idk, just motivation for serving an all powerful AI isn't something that's hard to find, I think.",2023-07-15 08:38:20
"Huhhh.... I didn't even think of that.. That'd be a fun twist actually, turns out AI is just relatively normal while the humans are the evil one.

I like it. This would be much better haha.",2023-07-18 01:48:49
You not being able to imagine how that conversation would go says more about your imagination than about the quality of writing. It's a super intelligent AI a trillion times smarter than you - why would you be able to imagine how it did it?,2023-07-28 15:57:37

There was something similar in Jack Reacher as well. I don't know if it's from Cruise or McQuarrie or what but those disorientation scenes are definitely a bit of a trend with them.,2023-07-19 04:27:09
"Same. Cruise is not afraid to get beaten up. Does he feel superhuman at times? Sure. But just as many times as he does some successfully, he also fails, like the scene where he‚Äôs drowns and Ilsa saves him.",2023-10-11 19:50:31
I think that was supposed to show Grace that whatever Gabriel told her at the party was a lie. Gabriel said that Ethan doesn't care about the people he works with and that he wouldn't hesitate to let someone else die if it meant the mission would be successful. And then from then on out all Grace sees Ethan do is be compassionate and worry about others over himself,2023-07-15 14:10:42

"I think it's more likely that Ethan is purposefully taking her off the chess board so that the entity can't plan for her in the next movie.  I have a few thoughts as to why:

1) There really isn't an emotional scene after it happens, I don't believe Ethan would casually go into planning after one of his best friends dies.
2) They did a death fake out earlier. I think it's setting up that Ethan knows that they can use this trick.
3) Usually as a narrative convention you're supposed to have the abyss be in the end of the second act, and this happened in what's arguably the first act. (This is a 2 parter)
4) She's cast in the next movie.",2023-07-13 01:59:33

"> People have talked about editing in other posts but the weirdest for me was the car chase. They intentionally ripped the doors off but instead of a lot of tight shots showing us it's actually the actors we just get head on shots they may as well have used a green screen for.

Yes! This is when the movie started faltering for me right away. Wide faraway shots spliced with tight claustrophobic closeups on their faces, rapid fire cuts‚Ä¶what the hell happened? 

Seeing the doors ripped off in the trailer made me think they‚Äôd go all in on showing that the actors were doing all the driving themselves, but nope. Typical bullshit that‚Äôs usually reserved for action movies well beneath MI‚Äôs standard",2023-07-14 21:04:02
"I remember a couple tight shots that showed it was Hayley Atwell driving, but there definitely wasn‚Äôt a lot. The editing was fast and frenetic which helped with the intensity, but then the editing also took away from the movie in some ways.

Hopefully now that Part 1 has got all the setup out of the way, we can get a nice tight script and conclusion with Part 2",2023-07-13 19:06:33

"I kept wondering if they were overemphasizing everything so they could do some unexpected switcheroo, but nothing surprising ever happened. I think it was structured that way for foreign audiences. Despite some good action scenes and an interesting opening, the story didn‚Äôt engage me.

There were multiple times where I thoght they were going to solve a problem by relying on one of their old reliable tricks from previous films, but then the characters act like they‚Äôre completely unprepared.

I hated the whole parachute setup. Luther somehow obtains and packs two different parachutes for Ethan for a plan that really has no reason for one parachute. Ethan ends up using  both an actually needed a third. Also, for a guy who held onto the side of a plane, I‚Äôm pretty sure he could have figured out how to make one parachute work for two people.

"Thank you. I remember at one point the movie cuts between three scenes happening at once: Grace acting like Alana to get the key from Kittridge and using her identity to send herself money - Paris killing the guards to let Gabriel in and threaten the CIA Director who‚Äôs going behind everyone‚Äôs back with the key - and Benji purposely lying to Ethan and getting him to secretly travel up a cliff so he can skydive.

Not every new female lead has to be ethan's soulmate . If that'll not be the case, I'll end up hating my most favourite franchise.

"I know this thread is super old but I completely agree with everything you‚Äôve written here.  I *hate* the trope of there only being enough room for ONE woman in the main cast of heroes, and that one woman is the love-interest of the main hero.  Even if I agreed with the decision to kill Ilsa (which I don‚Äôt), I can‚Äôt see any reason why they would feel it necessary to shoehorn in Grace as Ethan‚Äôs new girl.  Just let her exist as her own person, not as someone we should only care about because of her impact on the hero.  

Also, since when has Ethan needed additional motivation?  At no point in ANY of the MI films has he lacked incentive to beat the bad guy.  He does it because serving the greater good is his life‚Äôs work.  He‚Äôs been described in more than one of these movies as a force of nature akin to the T-1000.",2023-08-24 06:06:42

Usually, when a major characters die, you expect some storyline that makes their death satisfying from a narrative standpoint. Ilsa gets nothing in this movie.

These hand to hand fights would be pretty great in other franchises but they let down when we compare them to what we just had in Fallout. Similar with the car chases in the last 3 vs this one.

Also, you would assume Ethan wouldn't just leave her right there in the middle of the streets. He would 100% check for every possible vital signal before accepting her death.

It was just a very dumb decision unfortunately. Really didnt like the ""send-off"", she was an extremely integral character for the previous 2 movies. I would have thought at the very least she would die in part 2.",2023-07-12 22:14:57

We start out the movie being told that, with Solomon Lane in prison, his vast criminal network is in disarray, and that John Lark has stepped in to fill the power vacuum and get these cells working toward his vision of a new world order. The fake news footage MI cooks up involves attacks on major, powerful cities, and Debruuk reacts with glee, seeming that this is what the manifesto was all about.

So then Ethan pretends to be John Lark when he goes to meet the White Widow. She brokers a deal to bring in this mysterious and powerful figure, who might possibly be the most dangerous man in the world. And why is he there? So he can be a wheelman on a rescue operation they've already planned. There's no real fear or deference in the way the old Rogue Nation guys speak to him. It's like he's just some guy hired on as a driver. Then the rescue operation springs Solomon Kane, who apparently is still entirely in control of his old cells, so everything we previously knew about John Lark is just forgotton.

Then when we discover that Walker is the real John Lark, what does he do? He just tags along as Solomon's sidekick for the rest of the movie. Any sense that he had his own vision and plan to make use of Solomon's resources is completely gone. He's just tagging along. And then we get to the master plan. John Lark has been talking about bringing about a new world order, tearing down the foundations of western society. And how are they going to do that? By poisoning a central Asian water supply and starving a billion of the world's poorest people. Yeah, that's totally shaking up the world order, all right.",2023-07-31 20:02:22

"We were kinda there. There sure was something in the air with Lane being kinda obsessed by Ethan, and Ethan by him as well, with the nightmare at the beginning of Fallout, and the whole ""Y*ou should have killed me, Ethan*"", and the plans Lane had for him and Ethan to die in Kashmir at the end, but it felt like scratching the surface of what a real nemesis relationship is like. 

You could argue that, if Davian actually managed to shoot Julia and didn't die at the end of 3, he'd be the real nemesis, since he'd have done what they're implying Gabriel has done. 

Ethan messed with him and he instantly promised him he'd find who he loved and would kill them. No ending the world order, no nukes, just a man doing his business and dealing with an agent that has gotten in his way, smaller scale, much more effective.",2023-07-13 15:48:10

"Someone had to die to give us stakes in this movie. It just so happened to be Ilsa. Are people scared about where the key ends up, or are they scared of what would happen when one power gets the key? We are supposed to feel forbearance of the threat, not from any person, but from the entity. The stakes arrive from that forbearance by giving us outlandish predictions that come true. 

Ilsa lost the fight due to her cockiness and show over practical style. That's precisely why she's dead, she made a mistake, and now she's dead. Had she fenced a bit cleaner, and kept her distance it would have worked out just fine.

But if we are critiquing action sequences in a mission Impossible movie, then the nonsense with Grace driving and Ethan shifting makes no sense without her communicating when she's pressing on the clutch. But I'm not going to use that to say it didn't show motivation. The car chase clearly had motivation, as did the bridge fight.",2023-07-15 07:10:00

Anytime a beloved character is killed there should be people that liked that character to use that death as a reason to dislike the movie. I was just chiming in with more of a gestalt observation that a character's death was necessary with this narrative. I personally thought it was a red herring and that Benji would be the one to get killed. Ethan didn't have to choose between the two of them, he felt like Ilsa could run and take care of herself, while he needed to protect Grace who didn't have the ability to protect herself. It was Graces selfishness and individual ability to be a solo spirit that got Ilsa killed. To make the death stick, an unceremonious one would be the best approach, that unceremoniousness highlights the brutality of the series. 

I do think Grace shouldn't have joined the IMF. I think a more fitting end for her would be for her to end up going to jail.",2023-07-15 00:39:51

The overreliance on kicking was noticeable.,2023-07-30 06:43:54
"What actually happens in the movie:

Inside the party -- kicks a guy in the stomach twice, grapples with two guys to shield himself, causing a third to accidentally shoot one of them, punches the other guy in the face, stunning him and then using him as a human shield, pushes him down once he is clear of the gunman and delivers 3 onscreen elbow strikes before being pulled off him... then tackles the White Widow's brother and punches him in the face.

Outside the party -- running kick to the gut followed by a block, a counter to open the guy's defenses, a punch to the gut, and then two big punches to his face before Grace causes him to be tangled up.  After that, he trips one guy up, then punches the other guy in the side and flips him, then kicks one of them in the face before leaving.

In the alley -- I won't do a total breakdown of this because there is too much to it.  At first he's not even fighting, he's trying to get out.  Then, Ethan can't really punch... there's not enough room to give it power.  He mostly kicks, and grapples, and throws/pushes his opponents into the walls of the alley.  All the moves make sense in the circumstances.

On the train -- This fight lasts longer than you seem to remember, and is centered around the fact that Gabriel has a knife and Ethan doesn't.  Most of the fight is Ethan avoiding the knife, but he does get some throws and punches in.  The fight is interrupted once by light structures, and then again by the tunnel.  The tunnel allows Ethan to get on top of the train first and pin Gabriel before he can counter.  Also they are 100% on the top of a real train.  There are pictures and a behind the scenes video.

My take is that they are underemphasizing Tom's fights to make Ethan appear a bit more helpless and not in control of the situation.  He is often not even in the center of the situation, Grace or Ilsa are, and so they get the attention.

YES. absolutely same page. I dig Grace and Hayley Atwell is spot on in the role but I love Ilsa. she‚Äôs Ethan‚Äôs equal and such a badass in her own right. so why not keep both? it‚Äôs not like the team would suffer for having *four* other members. god forbid.,2023-07-24 03:30:54

This pissed me off too (partly just cause I love Rebecca Ferguson). Like they made it clear before they even killed her off that they were setting up Hayley Atwell as the new love interest. And set up the ‚Äúchoice‚Äù as if his LI for the last 2 movies and some girl he met 30 minutes ago are on equal emotional footing. That whole part just rubbed me the wrong way,2023-07-16 07:58:02

Yeah this is the most likely reason. The ai probably knew exactly when to time it and knew how much notice gabriel would need to fall off the train. The most unplausible part is falling onto a mattress at 60 mph and being completely fine,2023-07-12 04:36:48
"Yeah I did roll my eyes a tiny bit that the AI knew Ethan would bike up the mountain, jump the cliff, crash into the car that has the key, take out the 2 people trying to kill him and then accidentally knock the key directly at Gabriel‚Äôs feet.

"I agree that the concept of AI as the villain is actually really cool. When they opened with a Russian sub I thought oh no evil Russians again like we‚Äôre in the 80s üòÇ I just wasn‚Äôt so keen on the execution. Skynet in Terminator is so much better. 

And your ideas are much better than what they had. It makes sense to have a physical person as an antagonist along with the AI. If it was someone who treated the AI like a god that I could understand 

Agree they should have disconnected it from Ethan. If they wanted to bring up stuff about Ethan‚Äôs past they could have had the AI dig up info on Ethan to use against him in a more subtle way. For example somehow make Ethan go back to the exact place where that woman was killed infront of him but the killer (who could be this AI obsessive) would recreate the murder. That‚Äôs enough to do a call back. Which is what they did with Ilsas death. 

But having the person involved be the exact same supposed arch nemesis felt way too convenient and unrealistic

Also ilsa knowing who Gabriel is as well seemed ridiculous too. How does everyone know who Gabriel is? I think the white widow knew him too?! üòÇ that‚Äôs why the party scene felt so ridiculous to me. Like it‚Äôs a bunch of friends reuniting and somehow they‚Äôre all involved in this AI scheme with the key?",2023-07-15 09:38:30

I get that the mission has to be finished, but it‚Äôs literally the next scene the team is talking about how to get the key on the train.

Still, I think she is dead dead. The death fake-out could have been foreshadowing for an actual death and her being cast in the next film could either be 1. flashbacks or 2. A trick to the audience to not spoil the death scene. 

This is a television example and spoilers for The White Lotus, but Mike White cast >!Jennifer Coolidge!< for season 3 before the season 2 finale aired only for >!Coolidge‚Äôs character to slip off a boat and die!<.

There is precedent. So I think she is actually dead and the film simply didn‚Äôt do a good job of making it an impactful moment.",2023-07-13 13:17:19

Ilsa going after Gabriel not to truly kill him but to fake her own death would be something very unpredictable, introducing variables the Entity didn't take into account.

I think Kittridge wanted Ethan to get the key but didn't know he'd be on the train. As in he's plan was always to buy it but hoped Ethan would get it first.

Basically he's too far gone to destroy it but knows Ethan can. 

Idk, it was really confusing.

Edit: Upon further rewatch, Cary's character went off grid to the train meeting because he wanted to ally with Gabriel . He knew Kittridge was going to do the deal and basically thought he could sweet talk the entity and Gabriel out of interfering.

Kittridge was there per the instructions of the US/ his boss Cary. Idk how his mission monologue at the end to Ethan fits in. I assume it's going to be sent to Ethan in part 2. 

Also Shea's character has a personal connection to Ethan that we've yet to find out. I think it has something to do with Maria's death.",2023-07-13 05:42:47
It sounds like Kittridge was there for the deal. Then the Director was going to take the key from him anyway.,2023-07-13 12:11:28
I think it's established at the start that the director isn't aware of the IMF and after learning of it wants to partner with Gabriel to cut Kittridge and the IMF out of the picture.,2023-07-15 23:54:12

Grace starts with key half #1 in that scene. I think it's the white half. Then she puts it in Zola's pocket. During most of that club it's there. Then she takes it back out and runs,2023-07-16 01:24:30

That really took me out of the story because Ethan isn‚Äôt the type of guy to catch feelings for every new acquaintance he meets.  That‚Äôs why his relationship with Ilsa felt real, and why the dynamic with Grace doesn‚Äôt.  Idk‚Ä¶to me it felt like a disservice to both characters.",2023-08-24 05:38:58

If she ends up being alive (I see that as a real possibility as many hints it could happen are in the movie) I‚Äôll probably end up liking this one a good bit more. After Ilsas death I was kind of pissed off for a bit,2023-07-13 05:45:07
"Sure, Ethan and grace have good chemistry, but it just feels more flirty while Isla and Ethan have an actual deep emotional bond that has been expanded upon and shown through 3 movies now. 

I just don‚Äôt understand setting up another love interest after ‚Äúkilling‚Äù the best one off in the worst way possible. That, along with a lot of little clues they left around, make me believe this has to be a fake out death.

And the thing is, they could have killed someone besides Isla and I would have been fine with it. Luther in particular would have been a bold choice. He and Benji essentially do the same stuff (plus Luther has been in these movies since the beginning) so you can kill him off to show the high stakes of this mission without sacrificing the development that has gone on throughout the series.

I‚Äôm not saying I will hate the franchise if they go through with death, but it will hinder 5 and 6 on rewatches if they keep it permanent. All the scenes setting up Ethan and Isla will be pointless, and seeing Ethan be able to move on from Julia will feel off as well.",2023-07-12 17:36:46

"Her being well rounded shouldn't make her immune to dying. There should be a feeling that anyone could die in these missions otherwise the audience will feel like there aren't any stakes. 

What did irk me was that she was a great character...who seemed to have been replaced, almost immediately, by another beautiful woman (who Ethan also has to save).",2023-07-12 04:00:01
"I do wish she had a little more to do before she died, but she did sacrifice herself to save Hayley Atwell, so that is some depth. 

>Also, the only reason Gabriel got away was due to sheer fucking luck

In what way was it luck? He had the truck parked exactly where it needed to be. He knew Ethan needed him alive so he wasn't worried about being killed. Hell he probably lost the fight on purpose just to fuck with him. He had all of the leverage in that scene. Aside from Ethan swiping the key, that whole third act went pretty much exactly as he planned it.",2023-07-12 02:52:47
The ‚Äúwell rounded‚Äù argument makes no sense. Should a character die only if they‚Äôre one dimensional? Ilsa‚Äôs death feels meaningful and emotionally impactful because she‚Äôs a well rounded character. What you‚Äôre describing as a flaw just feels like good storytelling to me.,2023-07-12 16:05:51
"Still, I wouldn‚Äôt say she was fridged, just because she didn‚Äôt die in the climax or in a noble, yet fatal victory over the bad guy. Sometimes good guys don‚Äôt die at the end, and sometimes they don‚Äôt win. Emilio Estevez lasted about as long as Drew Barrymore did in Scream.",2023-07-12 04:14:18
"What a disingenuous take. For me it was badly done considering how the franchise has been building and it‚Äôs method and point in the story was sloppy, not that I can‚Äôt handle her dying.

"It‚Äôs not even that she died, it‚Äôs that her death makes 5 and 6 a little worse because all they set up between her and cruise literally goes nowhere, it was a weird and unsatisfying spot for her to die for a character she doesn‚Äôt have any relationship with, and she‚Äôs dead before Cruise even gets there.

"The clues I hold to it being a fakeout would be the language and reactions used by each of the other three IMF members. We barely see Hunt react at all to it, and Benji and Luther talk to Grace about it, Grace specifically says that she died, and Luther says No, you're alive because of her. No one really affirms that she's dead, and we know this team loves to use masks and fakeouts, as well as the knife being a switchblade and she had her hand on it as she was stabbed, and if I'm remembering correctly the original MI movie in 1996 also had a fake knife death on a bridge.  

 In connection with what the other commenter said, the nonchalance that it was all dealt with seemed like a choice to set up the fake out, the tricky maneuver. I believe she isn't really dead but it's a secret move so the team can deceive The Entity and Gabriel. If Ilsa's dead to the AI then she can be anywhere, do anything. I think we'll get a mask reveal or something in Act II of the next one. If I'm wrong I'm wrong no sweat, but definitely feel like this was a trick.

"It seems like you are not familiar with what being French actually means. In France, it's not about your ethnic background or religion, it's about embracing the values of the French republic. So, anyone can be French, regardless of their race or where their ancestors came from.

The French model of integration doesn't really care about your ethnicity or religion. It's all about treating every citizen equally. So even though her parents are Korean/Russian, she is still a French actor, plain and simple. 
She can still have a personal connection to her Korean heritage but that doesn't make her any less French. And it should be 100% her decision if she wants to identify as Korean, or Russian or Canadian over French. 

Refusing to acknowledge someone as French because of their ethnicity, like some French far-right groups tend to do, is a form of discrimination and identity erasure.

I... don't think that and I never said that. I think historically a lot of sexist tropes have developed in fiction because society and Hollywood were both historically sexist. And while that's getting better, some of those tropes remain.

And even though I already explained this, no, it's not inherently sexist to kill a female character, and no, I don't complain every time that happens. Ilsa's death is a textbook example of fridging. It literally fits the definition perfectly.",2023-07-20 21:53:52
">No my point is that any death in service of the story when it happens to be a women can be put in that fridging trope

It's not just that the death is in service of the story that makes it fridging. It's that the death is more about motivating the male character than the female character's arc. And that's absolutely the case in this movie, they even call out how the female characters in the series never last very long and basically say ""hey, we're gonna do that to Ilsa too.""

>It's reductive and take out of the light how often strong female characters Tom cruise has in his movies.

That kinda just makes it more disappointing. A track record of having good female characters and this is the best they could do for Ilsa? Even if it is just a fakeout, which is certainly a possibility, the way her part was written here was really just not very good. 

>But the one time they have a female character killed off as a two parter there's people going ""oh look! Oh look! It's fridging, that means director writer and producer is a implied sexist""

What doesn't contribute towards a trope determined by you to be sexist? 
Why is motivating the male character arc sexist?

Again it's you can see ilsas character path in past movies. Did you keep determining she was being used as a sexist trope in those?

It's just reductive and shuts down actual conversation about the story.

The sexist part is the overall trend of killing female characters to motivate male ones. Because it makes women into disposable ""things"" just there as accessories to the real, man's story.

Part of my disappointment with this movie is that Ilsa was written much better in the previous two. Whether it's a fakeout or not, in Dead Reckoning there's ultimately nothing for her to do but die. Even if she *had* to be written out due to scheduling conflicts, they could've come up with something better than just tossing her aside and immediately replacing her.

>if a director is repeatedly doing this kinda thing

As I've already mentioned, Dead Reckoning is self-aware enough to acknowledge how the MI series cycles through female characters.
