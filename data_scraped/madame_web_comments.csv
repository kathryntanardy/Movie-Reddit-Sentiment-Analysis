"For anyone wondering: 

Yes, the fact that all the shots of the trio in their hero suits are all in the same location at night, as well as the weird emphasis on how fun and important it was for Sydney Sweeny to hang upside-down correctly means that the only time they are suited up is for maybe two minutes in a psychic vision.",2024-02-15

I don't get Dakota's power. Is she having visions or is she time traveling? Sometimes she is aware she is in the future and sometimes she is completely shocked.

"This was absolutely fucking awful lmao. Worst film I've seen in the cinema in years, and yes, it's worse than Morbius.

**The Good:**

\+ Celeste O'Connor and Isabela Merced were the best parts of the movie.

\+ There are a few nice shots.. I guess???

\+ The joke where Dakota tries to climb the wall like Spider-Man and falls down. It's lame but it made me laugh which is more than I can say for the rest of the movie.

**The Bad:**

\- The dialogue. Just so much boring exposition, so many awful jokes that don't land. Characters talk like human beings never do, like introducing themselves by saying their full name for our benefit.

\- The plot. For starters it's an insanely generic origin story. Then there are INSANELY DUMB story points like the villain having a premonition of the Spider-Women beating him in the future, so he somehow manages to capture images of his DREAMS and then uses software to theorise what the Spider-Women look like in the present, and they suddenly morph into exact images of Sydney Sweeney, Merced etc. It's insultingly stupid.

\- The inane subplot where Cassie gets framed for the villain attacking cops. Wouldn't the subway have cameras? Even if not it felt so contrived. Considering the villain is shown having control of the city's cameras, a simple line about him interfering with them would've made this better

\- All the desperate Spider-Man links. I like Adam Scott but never really bought him as Uncle Ben and the subplot centered around The Birth of Spider-Man felt tacked-on.

\- The ""with all power..."" replacement line. The first time I didn't think it was so bad but it's repeated later on and made me laugh.

\- Technically this film is a mess, it makes Morbius look competently directed by comparison. Tons of weird snap-zooms and digital zooms for no reason, an excess of shaky cam, which makes most of the action look awkward or tough to follow.

\- Bad editing. Feels very choppy. Also makes the premonitions more annoying than exciting to watch.

\- Most of the CGI sucks.

\- Villain is awful.

\- For some reason most of Tahar Rahim's dialogue seemed to be dubbed. Sometimes it's legit out of sync on-screen but a lot of what he says is where his mouth isn't visible on screen, yet it was noticeably recorded after the fact because the timbre/reverb sounds different

\- Obnoxious product placement for Pepsi. The baby shower scene for Mary Parker has a can of Pepsi strategically facing the camera in almost every shot. Also the final battle takes place on the roof of a Pepsi factory and the villain gets crushed to death by a Pepsi sign lmfao.

\- Lazy, obvious musical choices like Britney Spears - Toxic.

\- Performances aren't great for the most part. Johnson just feels awkward and not in a fun self-aware way. Sweeney felt miscast to me. I just found her goofy stockings and glasses setup completely laughable too.

\- Trailers lied about the movie. Spider-Women never suit up except for about 45 seconds of flash-forwards at the beginning and end of the film.

I thought this was absolutely dreadful and not even in a fun way like Morbius. There's no ""have sex"" scene. It's just soulless and dull from start to finish. **2/10**",2024-02-15

"I went to see this movie alone at an AMC at 1 p.m. on Valentine‚Äôs Day, surrounded by about four or five other truly twisted individuals beyond saving.

So yes, I saw the movie in the way I believe the writers intended it to be seen.

This movie became a must-see for me after the infamous trailer drop got memed to death and Dakota Johnson nixed her agent before embarking on an incredible press tour.

That tour featured her apparent puzzlement at the trailer‚Äôs online reaction, and also a series of various see-through garments that I firmly believe were engineered in a lab to distract the masses as much as scientifically possible (see the butt cheeks and boots outfit on Seth Meyers).

Suffice it to say that coming out of this movie I had a lot of questions:

\-Did the American Heart Association pay the studio to promote the practice of CPR?

\-Why did the writers feel the teen tragedy trio all needed to have the saddest parental backstories possible?

\-What kind of plastic junk is Mattie‚Äôs dad helping to manufacture? Does he work for a Temu contractor?

\-Why did the teen trio just walk away from a campfire they built in the woods?

\-How much money would the Forest Service had to have given Sony to get some fire safety promotion?

\-Why is the diner 50 feet from the woods? Is this common in New Jersey?

\-How did Emma Roberts‚Äô agent talk her into being in 5 scenes of this movie? Is Emma Roberts okay ‚Äî did she lose money on crypto?

\-Why did the writers make us sit through Dakota Johnson‚Äôs deadpan awkwardness at a baby shower?

\-What the hell is the villain‚Äôs day job? What is his day-to-day motivation, other than not getting killed by the tragedy teens in his near future? What does he do besides look after his pet spider, nag his evil assistant, and create the world‚Äôs best surveillance system using a 10-digit passcode he got from his NSA honey? What's the extent of his relationship with his evil assistant ‚Äî does she sleep at his place?

\-Will Madame Web ever obtain any real powers, or just the ability to envision the future and summon the world‚Äôs worst CGI sequences?

\-And finally, when is Madame Web 2 coming out?  And will Emma Roberts be back?",2024-02-15
As someone who will never see this movie can someone explain what the Mary Parker thing is,2024-02-15
"I'm not sure if I have the time to properly get into all the ways this movie licks ass so bear with me here. Madame Web is an utter mess of tone and character that lets you down at every turn, a movie hacked to so many pieces that the ADR and cuts feel like they're held in place by scotch tape, a two hour runtime with no real humor or action to speak of, and four leads that struggle to fit in the most basic backstories and who all have negative chemistry with each other.

The whole thing is just so damn awkward. Dakota has zero urgency in her opening scene in which she's racing an ambulance through NYC with a patient in the back and she holds that level of intensity for every action sequence. Her dialogue seems to be distilled down to saying everything that's happening out loud, and there are tons of scenes between the four main gals that have no rhythm and you may struggle to even figure out what their dynamics are when they aren't saying super obvious things that won't come into play later like ""science matters!"" . The premise of the movie is the great importance in these three girls, but the movie doesn't depict them as having any sort of special outlook or skill or even morality that could possibly make them useful supers, and to make this bowl of nothing that much more disappointing, none of them even gain powers or don their outfits. Surely that's all being saved for ""Madame Web 2"" no doubt rushing into production as we speak.

I'm not going to go as far to say this movie is ""subversive"" because I think that implies some sort of thought put into the decisions and what to depict, but it's hard to see any other reason that the 40th superhero movie in the last five years would feature no heroes or real fights. There are action scenes, but it's usually seeing a small glimpse of action or a death that would be cool if it weren't so toothless, then snapping back to reality so Dakota can do something to avoid it. Beyond seeing glimpses into the future (unless it would stop her from being paralyzed or permanently blinded) her only superpower seems to be grand theft auto and hitting bad man with said auto. It shouldn't be so hard to find a way to make her power cool or clever, but it goes for the easiest and lamest route every time. There's no room for humor, like if she were to see something and react different for a laugh. Every bit of action that could have been interesting is immediately marked as ""not canon"" as her superpower actually becomes stopping anything cool from happening.


The third act is one of the most ridiculous climaxes I've seen in a movie like this and it swings so far into it that it almost becomes parody, but not the fun self aware kind. It's more like the insincere kind you get when a company is trying to pretend they're in on the joke but it becomes clear they don't even know what a joke is but they want to make sure you drink your Pepsi‚Ñ¢. Her going to Peru is a massive momentum stopper, not that this had much to stop, but it halts what little is going on. I told myself I would try not to use superlatives in this review, but the dream montage that is sparked by her trip to Peru is truly some of the most awful dream montage filmmaking I've ever seen. The issue of her resenting her mother really comes out of nowhere and is presented and solved in the same 45 seconds, and if you aren't picking up on the subtle visual storytelling don't worry because Dakota is standing right there to explain everything out loud:

""You went to the Amazon to cure... me???""

""But I don't have a neuromuscular disorder!""

Or my favorite from earlier in the movie, ""So it (pigeon) didn't die...""

I don't want to accuse the filmmakers of anything, but this movie itself thinks I am so stupid that I can't tell what's happening when it snaps back to reality so it has Dakota say out loud, often to nobody, exactly what's happening or what she's thinking. I actually really like Dakota, she seems really funny honestly and the very few sincere chuckles in this movie are due to her delivery, but this writing is doing her no favors and you can tell she and everybody doesn't want to be there.

Back to the third act, we all know how these climaxes go and this movie blunders through the motions; throughout the movie the characters learn things that will be used in the final act such as that incredibly awkward scene where Dakota teaches the girls to thrust resuscitate and we have to watch all three of them try in a long scene that I'm pretty sure is just fetish content. The ""final power"" Dakota learns from a Peruvian native dressed like Fred from Scooby Doo is used when the stakes are as low as possible (the three girls need help getting up at the same time) and negated by a single punch and never used again. Even when this movie sets something up, the payoff barely limps to the finish line with an unenthusiastic ""there, are you happy?""

I've spent too much time on this already but there's still like five things that are the stupidest thing I've seen in theaters in a long time:

- The villain shows up in Dakota's dreams or whatever and volunteers his entire plan and motives to her when she had no clue of either.

- Dakota doesn't recognize the villain right away even though he's prominently in one of seemingly only two photographs she has of her mother.

- Las Aranas is just Spanish for The Spiders.

- Dakota gets the idea that all of this is related to her mother because Sydney Sweeney says he crawled like a spider, then she leaves three teenagers she just kidnapped in a forest with no transportation and says ""I'll be back in a few hours.""

- They never explain why Cassie's true nemesis is a Pepsi can she, in multiple scenes, just cannot seem to open. It's not a physical limitation, she constantly almost opens the soda and decides not to. Truly cerebral acting.

- She steals a taxi cab early in the movie and drives it for the entire movie, even as it collects obvious damage. She smartly avoids the fuzz by prying off the license plates because that doesn't stick out as obviously illegal.

- At the end of the movie the girls show up with Chinese takeout and Dakota says ""Kung Pao chicken sounds great"" and Sydney Sweeney says ""How did you know?"" How does she know? Did you not watch the movie?

Any points this movie does receive is because the only time I felt like anyone was leaning into how stupid and fun this should have been was at the end when Dakota was in a wheelchair wearing those INSANE sunglasses that blocked out her dead eyes. I could tell she was cracking up under there, bless her heart.

Anyways this will undoubtedly be my lowest reviewed movie this year. It ended two hours ago and I truly cannot stop thinking about how it fumbled every moment and tone and barely crawled to the credits. Almost impressive to make a movie this oblivious and unaware when this type of movie has been the most produced and popular type of mainstream film for the last 15 years. 2/10

"Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.

From the advertisements, I expected this movie to be bad but I didn't expect it to be THIS bad. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is super poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy, dumb and poorly made. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.

The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was super boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. There really isn't anything else to say.

"I wrote this non spoiler take for my facebook. I usually edit these if I copy over here since I can tell but I do not care enough to. Man, I hated this movie. 

If Madame Web can really see and change the future, it'd be best to reset every single aspect of her movie. It is truly awful. 

It starts with a terrible script. Like Venom and Morbius, it seems to have fallen right out of 2003. Fitting, as that's when the film takes place. Embarrassing individual lines, heavy on exposition, repetitive (like they shot the same details in a few scenes and decided to keep both versions.  This happens a few times), and inconsistencies in logic, time, place, character, and powers. 

The acting of the bad script doesn't help. It ranges from bored (when Adam Scott can't bother, be wary) to awkward (Dakota Johnson as the titular character seems lost) to outright atrocious. Too many in that category for an aside. Zosie Mamet as the villain‚Äôs Man in the Chair in too many inexplicably dumb sequences. Sydney Sweeney looks like she's straining to read off out-of-focus cue cards. And the absolute worst acting I've seen in a long time comes from the terrible ‚ÄúEvil for evil's sake"" villain, Tahar Rahim. Nothing he said wasn't laughable.  The piss poor ADR did no one any favors.  


Madame Web looks like it was shot in an AI Art program. One full of odd zooms to hide this.  The editing is filled with ‚Äúwhy did they do this‚Äù choices and the action bits (for the few that happen) are curiously low energy. 


The attempts to shoehorn the Spider-Man Mythology are eye rolling and I audibly groaned (sorry two other people there). 

There are times when it is Catwoman-esque hilarious (the first two scenes indicate it's heading that way but soon becomes less so) but not enough to recommend even a drunk party watch.

Then the girls dance on top of a chair despite being told to lay low, not to do anything stupid. But they're teens, so whatever.

- We just spent the last three years hyper-sexualizing Sydney Sweeney and now we're going to give her the *She's All That Treatment*? Nah.
- Was the bad guy rich? Why did he have a staff of one? How did he make money? Why were the girls going to kill him in the future?
- A high-ranking NSA agent hooks up with a rando at the opera and goes back to his apartment with her badge? And then dies but no one in the NSA is going to confirm if her account was compromised?
- Random security cameras weren't good enough in 2003 to identify a broom, let alone facial recognition of a passenger in a speeding car.
- Why did the girls have to go with Adam Scott when Emma Roberts went into labour?
- Why did Dakota Johnson act so much difference after her accident? Just a complete personality change.
- Also, how much do New York paramedics make to afford that huge apartment in Queens?
- Can't the spiders fix Madame Webb again? Or do their healing powers last forever? I don't understand why she's stuck as a blind cripple.
- Only one of the ""teenagers"" looked like a teenager.
- Every bit of dialogue from the mom was stilted and possibly the worst writing I've seen in a movie the last year.
- Pepsi Presents: Madame Webb
- How'd he get photo realistic images of the girls on the computer? Could he draw them from his dreams? And then they can just track them out of everyone in the US apparently
- If they can find the girls from his mine sketches, how come they didn't track Dakota Johnson going to Peru?

It also kinda sucks because there were legitimately some interesting ideas in the script, like how the future visions work and Cassie learning to control them; or basically having Spider-man as the villain, which is an awesome concept.

"Well, I've just watched it...

It's a bad / horrible flick, but in a fun way. This is like the Battlefield Earth of the comic book movies. The dutch angles, the hilarious acting and the bad editing / action scenes are only a plus. It's definitely not offensive or disgusting in absolutely any way.

Dakota really carried the movie. I'm surprised I enjoyed her. I was fully expecting her to suck, but she was bearable. The 3 girls on the other hand were sometimes irritating and we know nothing about them or their lives. The villain was horrible in every scene, from the acting to execution. We also barely know a thing about him.

Things simply happen in this movie. There's hardly context at all. The protagonist has to protect 3 girls, but sometimes she leaves them behind and even travels to another country and returns in hours. The editing is atrocious. 

Sometimes the dialogues are heard, but the actor's mouth doesn't move. It's very easy to spot.Was the main bad guy dubbed? 

It's mediocre and horrible, but I've seen worse. The CinemaScore in the C range is well deserved. Not F material, but I understand how many people probably gave it an F anyway, lol.",2024-02-17

Sony also fails to really nail the 2003 year thanks to the guy playing his phone in the train whilst wearing a Mets hat that uses the redesigned logo in the 2010s.


Aside from that, what's up with the two reused shots from Spiderman 2? [Seriously.](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/RvuGHIOm6BqWKeiapiMSs2WVKYNI4q16s9s5Tg0e6VI/https/mosaic.fxtwitter.com/jpeg/1758513787563332039/GGd-Y13WgAI_Q_u/GGd-vTLWkAAqUQc?format=webp&width=785&height=700) What the [hell?](https://vxtwitter.com/tom_smith717/status/1758316898280702173?s=46). Why is her theme a blatent ripoff of the PS4 Spider-Man theme too?


The performances feel like they're all performing their lines through a Zoom call with massive delays, and it doesn't help that the script is devoid of human dialogue.

The absolute peak dialogue includes: 

You must have at least one fond memory of your mother. ‚ÄúWell actually my mother died in childbirth‚Ä¶ But it wasn‚Äôt that bad I mean obviously it was BAD, yknow, she died (laughs), uh but I feel totally healthy. Death in childbirth is super rare, I mean she chose to be way deep in the Amazon in the last month of her pregnancy, so she was hundreds of miles away from the nearest medical facility‚Ä¶ So‚Ä¶.‚Äù

The potential is infinite‚Ä¶ it's intoxicating‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ in the wrong hands, I mean‚Ä¶ people will be tracked anywhere they go‚Ä¶ it's going to change everything‚Ä¶

What are the odds of them in the same place and at the same time? ‚ÄúIt's not a coincidence.‚Äù there must be something that connects them. Or maybe something that will.


Enough. Your voice is like drilling to the head of my skull and I need to think. I‚Äôm Cassie, what are your names?

Okay anyone who wants to leave can leave right now. Wait, sorry, no you can't actually leave because you guys are the only ones that know what‚Äôs actually happening. Okay well this is what we‚Äôre gonna do we‚Äôre gonna lay low for a little bit and I‚Äôll figure out how to get out of this‚Ä¶ this is still not a kidnapping okay?

I don‚Äôt know. Crazy shit‚Äôs been happening and I don‚Äôt know why. Stop asking me ok?


I recognize you too‚Ä¶ Yeah you live in my building. You leave your junk mail in the lobby and then everybody else has to clean it for you. ‚ÄúOkay well there should‚Äôve been a recycling bin there‚Äù

3 Hours. Stay here. Don‚Äôt do anything dumb. Seriously, don‚Äôt do dumb things.

Until I‚Äôm 18 I can‚Äôt exist. There‚Äôs no way I can be deported. Or going to the foster system.

Tell me where they are! I don‚Äôt mean it. You can just walk away.

Okay so, this guy's hands somehow release an acute neurotoxin and it is painful. I was lucky. The longer he holds onto the more poison goes into your system. ‚ÄúThen what happens?‚Äù Then your heart stops. But you can offset cardiac arrest with CPR.

But I don‚Äôt have a neuromuscular disorder‚Ä¶

No no. I am unwilling to accept the diagnosis of‚Ä¶ helplessness‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not going to teach my daughter too either‚Ä¶

You didn‚Äôt get the gift of greater physical strength or the ability to use poison. But seeing into the future is only the start. Your mind has infinite potential. If you master your power, you can use your web to be in more than one place at the same time. You‚Äôre the only one who can change the future. And when you take on the responsibility, great power will come.

"It just completely lacks any ambition as a film. It's basically a lengthy montage that should be the opening credits of a Spiderwomen team up movie. So much of it just makes absolutely no sense.

You get one scene of them in costume that lasts two minutes and another 30 seconds at the end. It's basically like having a Spider-Man film but it's a few years before he gets bitten. 

The final shot of them all in costume is such a middle finger to the audience. Hey, you've sat through 90 mins of filler, maybe if you pay for another ticket down the line you'll get the actual movie.

"Pros: 

* That one scene with the girl charging the electrical paddles and using it to shock the top of the ambulance was kind of clever and fun

Cons:

* The writing, acting, directing, editing, cinematography, sound design, shot composition, story and pacing. 

I can't say this is some 'funny bad' masterpiece the way some are hyping it up, it's more fascinatingly bad in how sloppily edited it feels, but holy shit the one moment that absolutely killed me was when they were going through the fireworks/explosives factory and she goes ""Get down!"" right before the firework conveniently shoots a perfect, rectangular door shaped hole in the wall, without actually showing any explosion or bricks falling.

Like she could say ""pass me the Pepsi Ben!"" and I just wouldn't believe she really wanted the Pepsi lol. surely that's a big red flag in casting pre-production?  


Also, don't women (and everyone I guess!) deserve better superhero movies than this? I feel like women keep getting the shite-end of movie quality in the superhero world. Black Widow, Madame Web, WW2, Capt Marvel. The way they tried to ""sell"" the 3 girls as future superheroes ""You'll be strong, you'll be faced with adversity! But you'll push through! Because I believe in you!"" it's nauseatingly bad! It's so....ham-fisted and naff or something. Give women better scripts ffs lol. Just treat them like humans rather than a box to tick.

Also, three girls in mortal danger from unstoppable Spider-Fiend, I guess I'm going to leave them with my wet lettuce ambulance friend for protection while I leave the northeast of North America for Peru.

The movie is set in 2003 with mostly late 90s needle drops and one sequence relying on a song that actually came out in 2004. A Christmas Carol is on TV in the middle of summer. The movie teases a third act we don‚Äôt get. The action consists almost solely of Cassandra ramming vehicles into things. The dialogue is some of the worst I‚Äôve ever heard in a movie.

"The movie was set in 2003, and I guess the editors took that to heart maybe too literally. Everything feels like it was written, edited, and paced like a bad movie from 2003. It reminds me of the time my friend in high school was really nervous for a speech he had to do for English class, so he got pretty drunk and went up in front of the whole class and it was 5 minutes of just him bombbbinggg hard and fucking up all his lines. And it was the best speech in that class without a doubt and people loved it and laughed, even the teacher was almost smiling because of how bad he was doing. Watching this movie felt like that, it was just very fun bad entertainment.",2024-03-15

"It‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs charming bad.

There‚Äôs basically three good things that I can say about this movie‚Ä¶.

1. It didn‚Äôt make me actively angry when I was watching it like the very worst of the worst movies tend to do. 

2. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs good‚Äù quality to this movie that I can‚Äôt explain. 

3. The scene where she drives out of the side of a building in a NYFD vehicle and hits the villain in mid-air was just so unexpected and out of nowhere that it got a big reaction out of me. It was just so ridiculous that I felt like cheering hard. 

There have been a bunch of bad movies released already this year, and this joins the list. This was like the opposite of ISS for me in the sense that ISS was like being in a sensory deprivation chamber for an hour and a half, whereas Madame Web was more entertaining than ISS despite being more poorly acted and written. 

Dakota Johnson may have given the worst performance by a lead actress that I‚Äôve seen in quite some time, and the three spider-women + the main villain were all in a competition for worst supporting actor. 

As bad as it is, I‚Äôd take this type of bad over just plain boring and bland bad. Just my opinion tho.",2024-02-16

"Nothing else to do today, so I went to the movies alone like the dumb stupid worthless pathetic fucking loser I've always been destined to be. I should just bite a cyanide tablet and end this fucking nightmare once and for all. How many more Valentine's Days left before it's over?

*Anyway*, the movie was ""fine."" This is a hard one to defend because I actually like Dakota Johnson, but her monotonous tone has become somewhat of a meme by now. The trailers certainly didn't do them any favors. I actually liked it up to a certain point, but the entire third act was an absolute mess. It seems like everything that happened after she went to Peru was extremely abrupt and they gutted the entire last half of the movie. You can clearly tell there was supposed to be a lot more there originally, but it got focus grouped to death and stripped down to nothing.

My biggest criticism is that it's another ""origin"" movie setting up a better movie which is obviously never going to happen. They would have been better off integrating those three Spider-Women from the future rather than leaving it as a potential open-ended sequel. At the very least, I liked this better than Morbius (although there are plenty of comparisons to be made between both). The most positive thing I can say is that it was under 2 hours, so it didn't outstay its welcome.",2024-02-15

She is one of the worst current actresses but seems to always get a pass or benefit of the doubt, its always 'poor Dakota' for being given terrible material but never a mention of how talented she is at making awful material 10 times worse with the most bland and lacklustre acting. She delivers all of her lines in the strangest deadpan way and her behaviour on the press run to everyone comes off as funny and endearing, whereas I just find it rude. I cant imagine if she did not look the way she does that people would support her so much, she is truly awful.",2024-02-20

The best thing is they get pulled into another universe, or they all acquire delayed aging, which Ezekiel appeared to have.

Laughed at the baby shower and mostly liked the dynamic between Cassandra and Ben. Liked the idea of a serial killer spiderman and the bits of horror movie in the scene in the subway deserved more.

"Madame Web was awful just like everyone in the world knew it would be(Except for maybe the clueless executives at Sony responsible for its existence), but it wasn't quite *as* bad as I was expecting it to be because all of the actors involved clearly know that it's schlock and don't care about being in it and give zero energy in their performances, which makes the movie unintentionally funny.

Like, Dakota Johnson just doesn't give a *fuck* about this movie one bit, and it's hysterical to watch her sleepwalk through her role as Cassandra Webb giving the least amount of conviction in her lines as possible. You can't even call it phoning it in because she isn't even trying. 

If you need further evidence of her comical amount of contempt she clearly has for this, watch the press junket interviews she's in where Dakota is giving silly nonsense answers to everything. In one interview, she can't be bothered to remember the three Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, so she calls them Spider-Man: Here He Comes, Spider-Man: And He's Back, and The Goblet Of Spider-Man, lol. 

Allegedly, Dakota wasn't even aware at first that this wasn't an MCU movie and she later fired her management team after the first trailer for this dropped. I don't blame her. 

Bonus points because Dakota helped end the career of Ellen Degeneres. I think I'm starting to like her. 

But also, Sydney Sweeney clearly doesn't give a shit either, and neither do the other two actresses(Though I like the piece of trivia that Sweeney bought her costars Tamagotchis to fit in with the movie's initial 1990s setting, which was a nice gesture and a nice touch) 

The level of apathy is quite astounding, actually, and it does make watching Madame Web perversely entertaining to watch in an MST3K sort  of way. It never quite becomes a legitimately good time like the Venom movies, which are also both schlock, but are held together by the conviction of Tom Hardy's manic madness and his gay coded relationship with the symbiote. *However*, I didn't feel like my time was wasted because at the end of the day it's just a bit of comic book silliness, and I actually am invested in seeing just how far Sony is willing to go with their Spider-Man Without Spider-Man Universe until they reach rock bottom.",2024-03-05

"The reason this movie is so bad is because of unfinished plot threads. This basically made the entire movie feel like a 2 hour teaser trailer for the sequel that will obviously never happen.

* Who is Cassie's father? We learn it is not Ezekiel, ok who is it?
* What was that crap Ezekiel said in the beginning for why he needed the spider? His motive was completely forgotten by the movie.
* How did Ezekiel get insanely rich? Again what is he trying to do (except stop the girls from killing him and stopping whatever it is he's trying to do)?
* They acknowledge the 3 girls all coincidentally had contact with Cassie before she saved them, but they never explain why.
* How do the girls get their powers? The whole movie we're waiting for them to get bit by the spider and it never happens. Same thing with fetal Peter Parker.

The other far worse crime this movie makes is its audacity to cheapen and retcon the known established lore of Spider-Man. This isn't like Spider-Verse, this movie is positioning itself as a new definitive origin story of Peter Parker. So instead of Spider-Man being someone with unique powers thanks being bitten by a radioactive spider before he was born there's all these other people who also have them including some tribe of magic Latinos and even a dude who not only has Spider-Man powers but has basically the same costume.

"Hello, it brings me no joy to tell you all I went to see Madame Web so here's a 

MOVIE REVIEW

&nbsp;

It's called Madame Web because when you take all the plot holes out of the plot it's no longer a bunch of paper but just a web of tiny spidery threads that don't make any sense, get it?

&nbsp;

Madame Web is a collection of images played back quite fast overlayed with noises. A large amount of these images are ads for Pepsi (TM). We start out with a 10 minute sequence telling us that SPIDERS GIVE POWERS and THIS GUY IS A BAD GUY. Then we roll into an hour of an incredibly unlikeable, bland, boring main character painfully slowly realising she can see the future. Sometimes. Because spider.

&nbsp;

Our Pepsi (TM) ad is intermixed with a bunch of misunderstandings. This movie explictly does not understand a whole bunch of concepts that are honestly not that hard to understand. This includes but is not limited to:

- Teenagers
- Cops
- People
- Fireworks
- CPR
- Camera's
- The TSA post 9/11
- Taxi's
- Newspapers

&nbsp;

Some bullshit happens, the villain shows up and oh boy is he angry. It doesn't help that he's played by someone who desperately does not understand what acting means. Our MC and three teenagers with Different Skincolours and Different Personalities (TM) are now fugitives from the law for some bullshit reasons because writing is hard. This is when we meet our second main character: Plot Taxi (TM). It's a wondrous taxi that, when the numberplates get removed, renders any and all consequences of earlier actions null and void. Because writing continues to be hard our WANTED MAIN CHARACTER takes the Plot Taxi (TM) to the notoriously low-on-cops-and-cameras airport and flies the fuck out to Peru. There, she discovers HER TRUE POWERS and the movie insults us all by saying 'when you take the responsibility you will have great power' and I nearly passed out from rolling my eyes so hard. 

&nbsp;

Some more bullshit happens, and we go to the final confrontation with our Deus Ex Machina (1): fireworks that somehow range from 'nah mate it doesn't do shit' to 'blows up a wall and/or helicopter'. The villain decides this isn't embarrassing enough though, so he proceeds to get killed by Deus Ex Machina (2): a giant Pepsi (TM) ad. I'm not making this up.

&nbsp;

Even more bullshit happens, our MC gets blinded and is now wheelchair-bound. Somehow, any semblance of personality she had is now gone, and she turns into literally Bran from Game of Thrones Season 8 (TM). Fucking weirdest crossover ever but sure why not. We then get some shitty montage of the three teenagers with Different Skincolours and Different Personalities (TM) doing spider-things in the spider-future. What our MC didn't see coming is that that shit is never going to happen because nobody could give any shits about this dogshit rotting afterbirth of a Pepsi (TM) ad. Fuck off.

&nbsp;

1/10 avoid at all costs",2024-02-16
Movie felt like a ducking fan film lmfao but worse the ending scene was so bad it made me geek out. The future scene she sees of them fighting in the future or any scene shes sees in general for that matter with them having powers is so badly shot and so badly made you couldn‚Äôt even tell what tf was going on because everything was so zoomed in and the faces they were making were priceless. Idk how any of them got casted for this movie let alone this movie even actually being made it was an absolute joke lmfao you could just tell the actors in the movie gave no fuck about actually acting and just went along with this shit. That ending shot was so badly made üòÇ like i legit felt like i was looking at a photo of some girls trying there hardest to look like these characters from the comics but are no were close to representing them lmfao them fucking doofus ass looking glasses had me geeking theres no way she wasnt laughing at her self in wardrobe bc man oh man were those costumes fucking horrible i gotta stop theres so much wrong on this movie and it was just so badly made pls save your mny if yah gonna watch it at least go on bflix 123mvs movie4k or just dont watch it at all bc its a waist of money lol glad i didnt go to the movie theaters to see this bullshit i would‚Äôve absolutely asked for a refund lmfao,2024-02-16

It's one of the few times the Sony-verse got the story right.

"I watched it with a bunch of friends because I thought it was one of those movies that is so bad that is good, but in reality it's so bad that is just _bad_. 

Around the second act it becomes insufferable with tons of exposition and we all started to get pretty bored and distracted. 

By the end of it most of my friends weren't paying any attention. The only fun parts are at the very beginning but then the novelty wears off.

"This movie is truly baffling and pretty hilarious. I think there's enough so bad its good moments to warrant a watch if you are into bad movies. Some random thoughts about the film. 

-The opening scene in Peru was so off. The conversation between Cassie's mom and Ezekiel was awkward and terrible and so expositional. Then we continue to follow Ezekiel instead of the Mom. Anyone feel like it would've been better to see the Mom actually find the spider instead of just marching into camp comically yelling I found the spider!! When we see Ezekiel taking photos of the notes we realize he's evil and there's no surprise when he kills everyone (except the person actually holding the spider for some reason). 

-Ezekiel in general was just so terrible and funny. He legit sounds like Tommy Wiseau and all of his lines are horribly dubbed over. They don't match his mouth at all and a lot of shots simply just don't show his face. What the heck happened there? We also don't learn anything at all about this character. Like why did he want the spider? What did he do with it? He is obviously rich or something? But like what does he do all day? Also did the spider give him anti-aging powers? 

-I love how accurate Ezekiel was able to recreate the teens' faces. Like did he hire a sketch artist hahaha. 

-What exactly about Cassie's near death experience unlocked her future telling powers? It's never really explained. 

-Also was Ezekiel barefoot? 

-Also the scene of Ezekiel dumping exposition to his hook up was hilarious and so awkward. Did that lady bring her NSA work badge to fuck evil spider man? 

-The Uncle Ben/Peter Parker baby shower stuff is so weird and shoe horned in. Like did they think that people would be hype for that? 

-I feel like I missed something. Why did Cassie get on that train? And why did the non Sydney Sweeney teens get on the train? 

-The plotting after the train sequence is just insane. Cassie is accused of kidnapping the teens for some reason? Then drives them to the woods (???) and abandons them for 3 hours. She then drives back to the city and reads (out loud to a cat) her Mom's notes about spider people in Peru. Like she has clearly read through some of her Mom's books before, but was she aware of the spider people angle to her research? Meanwhile in the woods the girls have gotten hangry and decide to go to a local diner (and leave a fire burning in the forest. Did they really need to light a fire??) At the diner they are spotted by a local trucker who recognizes them as the kidnapping victims from the paper. But like didn't this kidnapping happen a few hours ago? How is it in the paper? Anyways this leads to Ezekiel driving to the diner to murder them. 

-Cassie returns to the pitch black woods to find the girls gone. She walks to the diner, sees the girls dancing on a table for some reason, and they are then all murdered by Ezekiel. But sike. It was a vision Cassie had in the woods. Cassie then hops in the cab that she stole and drives to the diner, which somehow takes way longer than wandering aimlessly through the dark wilderness. They end up escaping and go to a motel. 

-Cassie then goes back to the diner and has a trippy exposition dump with Ezekiel. It is a dream or vision or something. I don't really know. She then teaches the girl CPR (did the producer have a cpr fetish?) before going off to Peru to do further spider investigating. 

-In Peru, she begins back packing alone through the rain forrest and pretty easily finds the spot her mother died. There she meets the spider person who birthed her in a cave pool. I guess he was just waiting for her on the off chance she came. Idk why he's wearing regular clothes now but he is. He serves as a mentor to Cassie and pushes her into a pool to have a vision. In the vision, Cassie learns her Mother actually didn't hate her (idk why she thought this) but was actually trying to save Cassie from myasthenia gravis. I am in the medical field and I have never heard of an infant being diagnosed with this prenatally. 

-Peter Parker's Mom's water breaks and Uncle Ben and the girls all hop in the car to the hospital. Uncle Ben seems a bit flustered by the situation despite being an experienced EMT. It's not exactly clear why the girls have to come along to the hospital but they do and are instantly spotted by Ezekiel's surveillance system (which is straight out of the dark knight). 

-We then have our climax at a fireworks warehouse that has a Pepsi logo on the roof. Cassie uses her future powers to tell the girls when to duck and Ezekiel is defeated by the Pepsi sign. Anyone else craving a Pepsi? 

-Cassie is blinded and paralyzed at the end of the film. Is this from her powers? Or from almost drowning? Anyways her glasses and wheel chair are absolutely hilarious. 

-I'm also confused how all three of these teenagers are going to obtain spider girl powers? Are they going to intentionally get bitten by the spider? Cuz like how could all three of these friends accidentally get spider powers?",2024-02-16

Honestly, judging by the rest of these comments, i'm going to get hated on.",2024-02-20
Guys this is the FIRST movie I have ever seen where I left halfway through,2024-02-20
"Very subpar for a Marvel superhero movie and pretty much exactly what's been said by most of the critics, though I disagree on it being worse than Morbius but somewhat in its league, for sure - mishandled and undercooked and only worthy of interest due to the choice of casting. However, it's a pretty endearing trainwreck in being a capsule of a bygone era, what with the explicit 00's superhero vibe of Catwoman meets Final Destination and The Terminator, and much of the leading cast led by the oddly charming  Dakota Johnson and her young stooges (Isabela Merced, Sydney Sweeney and Celeste O' Connor) are so much more bearable than Jared Leto Leto-ing his way through Morbius (not to mention the geely Adam Scott as young Uncle Ben). 

Honestly, I always thought Johnson to be very dull and kind of devoid of charisma in every work she's in, but she's actually pretty cool here and reliable in the role of a ""Awkward, Reluctant Mother"" type even when her line delivery can come off as rough and stilted - albeit the extremely crappy dialogue are mostly to blame for it. Her co-stard don't fare any better but only one for the worse, where the trio of Sweeney, Merced and Connor could've been great under a better script, but as it stands Sweeney is simply a distractingly hot nerd, Merced a blank latina teen canvas, and Connor a feisty rebellious teen 

In terms of the concept and premise, I really like the more ""grounded"", horror-thriller based cat-and-mouse approach where the girls are barely trying to survive in the onslaught of Ezekiel Sims, who's basically an evil Spiderman in this, that I wished the film would concentrate more on the horror-thriller thing (Sims first appearance in suit with him crawling atop a subway station is unexpectedly creepy) than the mystical superheroic shenanigans the finale ends up being. However, the script is just bad, bad, bad on all levels and failing to meet the minimum requirements of the plot and overall narrative; characters aren't properly introduced and established, ties to Spiderman are muddled when taking into account the reworked origin of Web and the Spiderwomen (and Ben and May's inclusion to the story) leading to a confused lore, bad guy Sims bearing little characterization and poses lots of questions that aren't answered at the end, and all the teases for future films which we will never get. 

For what's worth, it's some interesting ideas like Madame Webb starting out as an awkward paramedic, her BFF relationship with Uncle Ben, the future trio of Spiderwomen establishing their own maternal bond with Webb, mystical Peruvian Spidermen, while others are pretty overtly bad such as Sims' overall character being reduced into being a evil businessman with Spidey powers and the fact that the teased Spiderwomen don't actually become Spiderwomen by the end. Likewise, none of these ideas are written and presented to their most appropriate potential, not even anywhere near close into contributing a workable narrative. The writers have not a clue, besides straying away from the source material and doing nothing with it, how to handle any and every character nor the main event that transpire and relegate everything to a surface level story that makes little sense the more you think about it. 

The dialogue is entirely abysmal, probably one of the worst in a superhero movie ever and provides neither actor with anything to work with, along with the 90% of horrendous ADR by Tahar Rahim as Sims contributing to the plastic feel of what's supposed to be a cool supervillain. 

In regard to the direction by S.J. Clarkson, who brings forward little bits of neat visual flourishes throughout with the dynamic camera movements, but her inexperience in directing her first feature film really stands out the majority of the time. Insufficiently and abruptly structured, poorly edited, bland and unexciting action, made-for-streaming visual outlook etc. it's hilarious how identical all of the films of the Sony Spiderman (Venom?) Universe is that the underwhelming handling is becoming a sort of a template nowadays (let's be honest Kraven will be more of the same as well). Truthfully, despite all of its negatives, the movie itself being set in 2003 and actually feel like an early 00's stylized superhero movie in the vein of Daredevil, Electra and Catwoman, and as a nostalgic fan of said films, I find Madame Web to be just as dumb and entertaining enough to not be overly boring or off-putting like Morbius.",2024-02-15
"I've been among those that made fun of everything going on during the last few months regarding this movie, and was absolutely convinced that it would end up as the kind of bad that is by the numbers, generic, uninspired, soul- and heartless. When the reviews came out, my impression shifted to unintentionally hilarious trash that fell short in the ambition of becoming at least a somewhat tolerable superhero flick in an exceptionally long line of marvel/sony/dc garbage. I decided to watch it for a laugh, and - I'm gonna get downvoted a ton - found it incredibly charming in its goofyness, appreciated its suspense-thriller-angle, seriously thought that those responsible for the movie at least put some heart into it, and tried to do something to distinguish themselves from the canon. Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney were lovely in it, while all of the girl's character evolutions and their relationships with each other were nicely uplifting.

This is not to say that Madame Web is a good movie - it is bad, but bad in the right ways, as clich√©d as that sounds. It's gonna gain a cult following and become for the superhero-genre what I Know Who Killed Me became for Psychothrillers.

Edit: What I also appreciated was that they went with a female cast, but did not make the mistake of going that pseudo-feminist-bullshit route that led to the strangulation of so many other projects of the last years.",2024-02-16
"Dakota Johnson felt pretty proud for not knowing anything about the previous Spider-Man movies. Like that was beneath her. And now it appears she fired her agent for getting her into this movie. Serves her right I guess.

These nepo-babies can't be bothered to put in the littlest bit of effort in their work.",2024-02-15
"Personally, I enjoyed the movie. I get there's a lot of hate on it because of lacking villain reasoning. But truly I think originally the man just wanted power to build wealth. The moment he stole it he saw his death every Night and was then just focused on stopping it. That's all there is. No big plot or anything. Just a small villain who couldn't leave anything alone. 

As for the somewhat emotionless madame web. I mean as far as I know for comics, That's how she is. She's not this big web swinging hero. She's the one who sets up the future for others. She is blunt and straightforward and I actually like that about her character. I'm glad this wasn't just another web swinging movie.",2024-02-17
"Just got back from seeing this, and honestly, it wasn't as bad as the internet has made out to be. Don't get me wrong - it isn't great, and it's nowhere near as slick as the Disney MCU movies. But there were some interesting ideas in this film.

First of all, it's not really a superhero movie. It's more of a slow burn psychological thriller. The sequence on the train at Grand Central Terminal was actually pretty gripping and well-executed.

Dakota Johnson does a good job with the material she's given, especially in the scenes where she's on her own and reacting to gaining her superpowers.

The early 2000s vibe is captured pretty well, and it even *feels* like it was made in that era. The atmosphere is much more *Unbreakable* than *Avengers*. If M. Night Shyamalan had directed a Spiderman film in the mid aughts, it might have looked a little bit like this.

Now on to the negatives - both the Peruvian sequences were leaden with clich√© dialogue and plot holes (how did she leave the country and get back in again as the chief suspect in a kidnapping?). I rolled my eyes so hard at the scene where Cassie ""met"" her mother.

The villain was forgettable and poorly acted. His lines were so obviously dubbed, it made me wonder if they were originally meant to be spoken in Spanish (his character is Peruvian) and the producers changed their minds at the last minute.

Sydney Sweeney was surprisingly not good. Casting her as a shy, self-conscious teenager was a mistake. It just wasn't convincing. Her outfit too - it just didn't fit with the character they were trying to portray? The other two actors playing the teen characters were okay. I've never seen Sweeney in anything else and I'm sure she's a decent actress, but this role just didn't fit.",2024-02-18
"It's certainly not going to win any awards, but it wasn't *that* bad.

You'd think it kicked people's dogs by the way they're offended by how bad it is.

The villain tho - oof. I don't think his lip movement matched like ANY of this words.

But is there any explanation at all as to the psychic dream thing? Ignoring that it's the villain monologuing his entire plan or whatever, but neither the villain or Lady Web were shown to have any psychic powers or anything",2024-02-18

"This movie was even worse than the critics made it seem and it's so cringy. I mean, the best part is that Dakota Johnson is visibly doing this for a paycheck and she looks miserable saying the godawful lines in the script. At one point, she rolls her eyes at how bad the dialogue is. 

Also, what the hell is going on? Some mass murderer is looking for Dakota and ""My Girls"" and she has time to go to South America for a week? And how did Zosia Mamet get herself in this? She looks like Mary Lynn Rajskub. 

It's campy but also dull. A two hour movie with barely no action. Dakota Johnson is funny with her deadpan monotone delivery and Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O Connor try their best to be convincing as the vapid, unlikable victims with their CW teen lore dialogue.

"This one was rough to get through. My eyelids were actually getting heavier and heavier as the movie progressed. None of the main cast had any chemistry with each other at all, performances were lackluster, especially Dakota Johnson, but don't really blame her. And these three other girls that she is protecting, did not buy that they were teenagers at all....ik their age irl but it's still painfully obvious they are adults in this movie.

These three ""kids"" don't even do anything even close to superhero-like for the WHOLE movie, excluding like 30 seconds of them fighting crime in their suits in visions of the future, that's it. They are just teens in danger for the entire movie! No character development that properly leads to becoming these badass Spider girls. The villain was also very boring. His entire character is he is trying to kill these girls before they become superheros and kill him, that's it. That's his ENTIRE character. Plus his post-production dubbing or whatever it's called SUCKS.

This movie is just friggin boring. The action in this is not even action, just repetitive sequences of Madame Web seeing the future like in That's So Raven and immediately yells to a character to ""watch out"" and that's all it is, aside from when Web hits the boring evil Spider dude with an ambulance to save the ""teens"" and Ben Parker. The only time there's anything really actiony is in the climax battle, but I still didn't care. And how Web goes blind.....it's basically just ""ouch"" and she has no other reaction to it. She just lost her eyesight forever and.....has no realistic reaction to it. 

My only real positive I can give here is Adam Scott is pretty solid in this movie, gives a far better and more charismatic performance than this movie clearly deserves....",2024-02-20

The absolute best thing about it was the diner scene. When the guy with the poison powers showed up. And they were playing Toxic by Britney Spears. Get it? Toxic. Because he's a spider. And he has poison powers. And the song is called Toxic. He's a spider. The song is Toxic. *Do you understand the reference?*

I honestly lost it when I noticed that. This is like Shrek 3 levels of hilarious. *Quick, we need a song for the King's death scene - let's use Live and Let Die by Guns n Roses because it has ""die"" in it - perfect, next scene.* In hindsight, I'm honestly amazed they had the restraint to not go all out with Alice Cooper's Poison.

Man‚Äôs is obviously way more powerful than anyone there and has ample time to execute all of them right there but decided to off the cops for no reason and allows them enough time to escape. 

- the diner premonition.
let‚Äôs just leave that fire in the woods unattended‚Ä¶ The teens including Madame can walk to the diner in no time but when she snaps back to the taxi it feels like she‚Äôs driving for miles before reaching the diner. Also right at the end of that racing to get there, she overtakes a truck just to swerve right in front it like you couldn‚Äôt just wait 1 second for the truck to pass?

- the taxi and the flight. 
Everyone‚Äôs on the lookout but no1 is picking up that taxi? Not sus at all with that damage plus not reported stolen? And let me also just casually jump on a flight to another country AND return without being detained?

- the Pepsi building
The state is dire and shit is falling apart everywhere, madame is swung into the lake by the falling signage and the rescue chopper just crashed. Seconds later 1 of the teens are diving her out and all three of them are on the floor safe and untouched with no signs of help/assistance from anyone. Also the villain just casually chilling there whilst she has her ultimate saviour moment and waited for her to save all 3 of them before kicking her out it?

- the teens

"Dakota Johnson became Gary Oldman in Hannibal at the end. That image and mental comparison was almost the highlight for me.

Where do I begin? The general idea and premise for the movie, but the execution and unfolding story is utter batshit insanity. The direction is all over the place. The acting is mediocre. Tahar Rahim's dialogue as Ezekiel Sims is so blatantly ADR'd/dubbed in, even when he's *on fucking* ***screen****,* that you now have something to a drinking game for the movie. Also addable is whenever Dakota Johnson has a Final Destination premonition that she then prevents. (Fuck it, add whenever we see Ezekiel Sims in the definitely not Miles Morales suit.) The action scenes are minimal and mostly Final Destinationed. But the third act takes the idiocy to almost brain cell killing levels of stupidity. Copying over from a different comment I wrote on it:

The climax is at a fireworks storage by the harbor that has a giant Pepsi Cola sign on top of it. Earlier in the movie, Dakota Johnson is called in there due to a fire. Dakota Johnson grabs a bag of flares from an ambulance she stole (they literally do that one scene from Furious 7 here), has the girls place them around, yadda yadda yadda, fireworks go up to the roof where a chopper she called in is circling around. And while the fireworks going in all directions, she takes a piece of roof steel, and uses it as a shield like she's goddamn Captain America. One firework she deflects hits the chopper, and it goes down. There's a big ole' confrontation between her and Ezekiel surrounding the girls while on the Pepsi Cola sign, and with all the shit happening, it results in him falling down and getting crushed by an S, Dakota Johnson falling down into the river right after, with the other S following her down, and she's then hit by a firework, blinding her. The other girls rescue her by doing CPR because she taught them that at a motel, and she recovers in a hospital.

Then it's some time after, and she's now Gary Oldman in Hannibal. She's now using her clairvoyance to lead the girls as a superhero squad (akin to the ending with Gwen in Across the Spider-Verse, and Birds of Prey), we see their suits (yes, Dakota Johnson is in that red leather catsuit, but she's wearing those stupid glasses, and it's only for 20 seconds, so we got fuckin' robbed!), and cut to credits.

I'm not making any of this shit up. This is legitimately what happens in the movie.

This movie robbed us of two things: Hearing that glorious and infamous trailer line in the movie, and seeing more of Dakota Johnson in that red leather catsuit. Yum yum! And the promo shots of the other girls suited up is literally all there is of that in the movie. We've been tricked, we've been backstabbed and we've been bamboozled!

They also have some just bizarre ideas an plot devices like Adam Scott being co-worker Ben Parker with a pregnant sister, Mary. Her water leaking early while they're watching over the girls, who're now targeted by Sims who has access to NSA surveilance after tracking down an NSA worker at an opera, is used as a plot device culminating in Dakota Johnson doing that scene from Furious 7, like I mentioned earlier.

Wrappin' up, since I use dice metric to score and rate, because we vikings are weirdos, this is a 2/6 for me. There were some OK concepts and ideas, and some of the wacky shit got a laugh, but other than that, this was a fucking travesty.",2024-02-15

"Madame Web was such a background character, that I figured that only the die hard fans of Spiderman would know her.

And after this movie, that is where she belongs, in the background.

I know my siblings love Spiderman, and sometimes she would role play as Madam Web and even she wonders how the hell that Madam Web got a movie. The chair guy never gets a movie. And that is what basically Madam Web is. 

How would someone successfully craft a superhero origin movie where the MC is a precog and can't jump, punch or act? This movie answers that question; they can't.

I suppose Dakota Johnson is a fine actor when portraying an everyday firefighter, but when she tries to act more than that, probably that is way out of her depth. Maybe the moviemakers pitched this movie to the wrong Dakota.

The way the editing was done was interesting, like this is how you should not edit a movie, or write a movie I suppose.

The facts in the movie was wrong. First thing in a cardiac arrest, please please please, for the love of God, call for help first and not just start CPR.

I know that is controversial, and there is a huge circle jerk around this but the reality is, without any help out in the field, CPR is not a magic spell that can revive the dead. The success of CPR out in the field is way of below than what you might think it is, around 15-30% success, If I am being generous.

Secondly, let's differentiate between poison and venom. 

If you eat it and you die, it is poisonous. 

If it bites you and you die, it is venomous. 

Most spiders are venomous, although there might be some that are poisonous, I don't know. 

But what depicted int the movie is called a venom. 

It is like the movie when out of their way to avoid saying the word ""venom""? I don't know why. 

And cpr is not another magic spell for a venom. You need the appropriate antivenom. 

Sometimes a movie can be saved by the antagonist or supporting actors.

But that didn't happen here.

It is apparent that the moviemakers are pandering for the children.

His vision vividly showed characters in the movie will kill him.

That is enough motivation for any villain to kill someone.

But the movie tried to say it was more than that and they didn't even try to elaborate. What did he build? He just stole a spider, and he didn't even sell the spider to the highest bidder. How did he become a Dark Goth Spiderman after stealing a Spider? 

I know some slated his dialogue; but he is a middle eastern actor acting as a guy from South American. Let's be honest, His English is better that the average American. 

Let's be honest Sydney Sweeney is an attraction. We read the news report. But she was underwhelming here. It was classical bait and switch.

If she dons her costume, there is no doubt in my mind I will be watching the next movie.

The Parker family side story is pretty much a distraction but seeing that Adam Scott drank the same elixir as Keanu Reeves and Paul Rudd, we know he can be the next Ben Parker and die as Ben Parker.

I can't wait to see another Ben Parker dying.

This movie is a solid 7 to hard core fans, although I can see a lot of people downvoting this movie.

Let's call this movie what it is. 

This movie isn't a symptom of superhero movie fatigue for the audiences, rather a symptom of superhero movie fatigue by the writers and movie makers, or a cynical cash grab by the greedy studio executive.",2024-02-15

"I can come up with a much better plot:  
The movie would start with a younger Madame Web getting bitten by a spider and the next day, wakes up in what she doesn't realize until later is another universe. One day, she is rescued by Spider Gwen (an alternate universe version of Emma Stone's Gwen). That night she finds herself invertedly summoning the Spider Noir from the Miles morales movie, who after mentioning he was part of a group looking for a specific spiderman (Miles) he disappears. TVA agents appear, revealing she has the power to summon spidermen from other universes.   
She escapes to another universe when the TVA agents are killed by an evil spiderman with the  Spots powers. This universe, Toby Maguire is doctor strangr/Dr Spider and they come to understand Madame Web comes from a universe where Miles Morales becomes spiderman yet went mad after obtaining the spots powers. Killing spidermen across the multiverse, TVA agents who try to stop him and is drawn to Madame as she's from the same universe and she also developed the power to access universes with spidermen in them. After training, she has a vision with the spider god, the source of all spidermans powers, explaining that she will fail unless she offers up a sacrifice.  
Madame soon faces Spot/Spiderman and summons several alternate spidermen to help, including Dr Spider, Spider Gwen (Emma) and another Toby Maguire spiderman that instead retained the Venom Suit. Despite their efforts, they fail and Madame, instead sacrifices herself to drag her and Spiderman/Spot into the spider gods universe which devours the evil spiderman. It resurrects her but she is permanently blind.

It had big ""found family"" themes which, as someone who birth family abandoned me and the only family I have now is the one I chose for myself,  I always cherish seeing in a movie because it reflects something I've personally been through.  The part at the end where she's in the hospital and the nurse asks if the girls are Cassie's close family, and she says ""they are, they're all mine"" and that she had everything she needed right there almost made me cry.

Tahar Rahim was great as Ezekiel Simms/the evil Spider-Man too, I love the parts where he's in the dark Spider-Man costume and just silent but deadly. Like I mentioned above, it was very Terminator (I actually thought this was a better Terminator movie than most of the recent Terminator sequels, haha) I always thought it'd be super terrifying if someone like Spider-Man wanted you dead, because there's not really a whole lot you can do about that, right? The costume and the way he moves were just super creepy and well done, the action scenes where they try to get away from him were far and away some of my favorite parts of the film. The part at the end where he jumps onto the cars and he's ready to kill them all and Cassie just hits him so goddamn hard with an ambulance was fantastic- and then he just gets up and keeps chasing them!! I really love that we got a movie with a Spider-Man as the villain, I don't think that's ever been done before and a lot of the shots where he's jumping around on walls or away from explosions looked fantastic. I also liked the Peruvian Spider-tribe even though we don't see a whole lot of them.

I thought it was cool as well to have a female superhero who's greatest weapon is her mind (and hitting people with cars and/or ambulances). Like, she's not super strong and she can't fly or anything like most superheroes can, but she's got this psychic power that gives her a mental edge, and it's her thinking on her feet that gets her and the girls out of most of the tough situations in the movie. As a woman myself, I appreciate there being a movie about some Spider-Women for once too (and they all looked fantastic in their costumes, even though you only see them in a few scenes).

I know a lot of people are hating on it because it's not directly connected to an existing Spider-Man franchise, like the ones with Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland, and it's not part of some ""cinematic universe"", but that's part of what I liked so much about it. I'm tired of cinematic universes and superhero movies that rely on the nostalgia factor of ""hey here's that thing you like!"", and I'm ESPECIALLY tired of superhero films that are about the multiverse (thank god this had nothing to do with that). This was just a movie that stood on its own and told an original self-contained story. And who cares if Peter Parker isn't Spider-Man in this movie? (he's actually a baby in this, and they made a very funny joke where his mom says he keeps ""leaping around"" in there. Is baby Peter Parker wreaking havoc on his mom's birth canal?) We've had a bunch of movies with him as Spider-Man recently, and I like the idea of just doing something DIFFERENT we haven't seen before. Not everything has to be connected to a million different things or some other version of the character, sometimes it's okay for a movie to just use the central idea behind something and tell a new, unique story. I'm tired of the MCU and I'm tired of there being a billion different universes that I'm supposed to keep track of, just tell me ONE story in ONE universe. I don't need to go to another galaxy everytime I just want to watch a movie about people with superpowers.

I also liked that it was set in 2003- I was really young back then, still a little kid, and so all the needle drops and aesthetics of that time period felt really warm and comforting. I think the early 2000s is an untapped market for period pieces. They got the look and the fashion choices on point too (I actually think Cassie's outfit was pretty timeless, I want to wear a cool red jacket like that haha)

I'd happily watch a sequel to this, but I'm guessing from the amount of hate this is getting (bizarrely too, I've never seen people so ANGRY about a film before) that's not going to happen. I'm cool with that too though, I think this movie tells a whole story from start to end and it doesn't really need any sequels expanding on that. I really loved it though, I'd give it a 4/5!",2024-02-16

Her agents would have not even thought twice about accepting a small roll in an AAA mainstream film. It was a no-brainer. Hell, if this film ends up benefiting anyone's career; it'll probably be hers.

"Ok a lot I want to respond to here:

>Did the American Heart Association pay the studio to promote the practice of CPR?

So am I crazy, or were they doing CPR completely wrong? I haven't seen anyone mention it, and from how much it's featured in the movie, I figured they had to be pushing the newest method. But...they never do any mouth-to-mouth. They just do a bunch of really fast chest compressions, and apparently you can't stop ever. Idk, I got CPR certified once like 15 years ago, but I can't believe you would never need to put air in the person's lungs. 


>Why did the teen trio just walk away from a campfire they built in the woods?

I caught this immediately. With as many wildfires as they have in Cali, and as many celebs have lost houses and possessions from wildfires, I would think they would want to push good fire safety. I would give them the benefit of the doubt, and that they were trying to show how dumb and reckless the girls are. But then why not show any consequences? 

>Why is the diner 50 feet from the woods? Is this common in New Jersey?

Honestly it looked like they were right off the highway, so it's possible that was just a diner at a highway exit. I'm more concerned about how the hell they got that cab to drive that far into the woods. I didn't see any kind of road, it was just an old ass cab in the middle of the woods just driving around. At the very least, the suspension on that should have been completely destroyed and undrivable. 

>Why did the writers make us sit through Dakota Johnson‚Äôs deadpan awkwardness at a baby shower?

"My sister and I just read your review together and laughed so much. Seriously, on the nose! We saw it tonight, and I can't stop thinking about all the issues. Also, it caused a fight between us because I wanted to go to the showing of A Ghost Story (AMC released it for exactly one showing today because of Valentine's Day, and we've never seen it but I've been wanting to for years and was so excited to have the chance to see it in theatres instead of on TV for the first time), but she preferred to see this for Valentine's Day instead. I'm literally punching the air right now and during the whole movie. I knew it wasn't going to be great from the trailers, and I was like, ""We can see this on Friday. Let's watch A Ghost Story instead!""... but no... so I compromised like an idiot. There's no fucking way I would've compromised if I knew that the writes of Morbius made this movie. I only found out after reading this reddit post.

Anyway, I have to add to the stupidity bullets you made. Mine are super nitpicking, but this movie is now living rent free in my head for all the wrong reasons. Did chatgpt write this shit? No wait, that would be insulting AI too much. The shitheads behind Morbius did.

‚óèWhen Adam Scott saved Dakota after she went down off the bridge in a car. Like, how did he get down and pull her out of the water and under the bridge? And why wasn't anyone else there with him? Did he dive off the damn bridge straight in? How could he? Or did he run down, then swim in from the shore, swim over to where she fell in, swam down to the ever sinking car that is probably very far down by that point, somehow break the window open, pull her out of the car, swim up out of the water with her, and do chest compressions until he revived her... all in 3 mins?

‚óèWhat was with the Final Destination BBQ scene? From the vibe of the editing, directing, and acting, I thought that ""Pushing the patties can easily cause a fire"" would lead to just that. I only thought that stupid thought because they commented on it a million times. Like, why did they prolong that scene and emphasize it so much? Weird.

‚óèEmma Roberts JUST met Dakota but cared so much about what she had to say during the games. Why was she so laser focused on her instead of her real friends?

‚óèWhen Sydney Sweeney materialized out of thin air in the hospital hallway. That whole scene was edited so weirdly.

‚óèWhen Sydney yelled to the police in the train station that they were being kidnapped. To me, I didn't even notice that the officers looked their way. I thought that they didn't even hear her. They sure as hell didn't walk towards them and question Dakota. Then, later, in another part of the station, like 5 officers go to handcuff Dakota. Wtf?! 

‚óèAt first, I thought that maybe the villain was like invisible to anyone but them. The editing and dialogue were both so weird because in the train station, they kept saying that no one could see him. And after when the radiostation said that she killed the police, they again repeated that the police didn't see him. How? He killed a few of them, and more came to fight him when they left. So I thought maybe some other crap was going on. Made no sense. Also, why was Dakota so freaked out about them mistakingly thinking it was her? She could've driven straight to a police station and had the 3 teens tell them exactly what happened. She'd be cleared and they'd probably all be safer.

‚óèWhen that guy in the Diner called 911 because he saw the 3 girls in the paper. First of all, how the FUCK did that happen already? They were ""kidnapped"" like 3 hours before. Plus, none of their parents were involved. How did the police identify the 3 girls, get their headshots, provide the info to the newspaper so that they could write up the headpage, then print and disperse the newspapers so that Diner guy could have it in head less than 3 hours after they were ""kidnapped"". 
Second of all, why did he call the police? He saw that they were alone and safely eating food. No Dakota in sight. They were flirting with the teenage boy booth for fuck's sake. Then instead of going up to them and saying one word, he immediately calls the police? OK, amazing Samaritan I guess.

‚óèWhy were they dancing on the table like buffoons? That was so awkward.

‚óèDakota has another future vision. She doesn't see them at the campsite, so she Blue's Clues after their footprints and walks the presumably half mile to the Diner in time to see girl 1 and 2 pull girl Math onto the table with them to dance to Britney Spears' Toxic. Then she walks in and blah blah blah, Million Dollar Baby chair neckbreak, blah blah blah stab. Then she goes back to present where she is safe outside of the cab back in the woods... and Toxic has already started playing? What does it take, like 8 mins to leisurely walk half a mile? Why did the music already start playing then? She made it to the Diner in time to see the 2 girls pulling the 3rd girl on the table, but with a cab she didn't get there until after all three were dancing and the villian came inside 60 seconds later, then she ran into him? The timing doesn't line up at all.

‚óèShe rammed into the Diner with the stolen cab. Looks like she drove like 1 mile to the motel. So they're searching for the 3 girls and know that a stolen taxi drove into the diner... but Dakota parks it in front of the 1 mile away motel without a care in the world? And the police don't find it?

‚óèWhen Dakota shows the 3 girls the photo of her mom and the Villain in Peru, they immediately recognize him. It's annoying that Skater Girl says, ""So this is your fault"" or ""because of you"" or something. Girl, she just saved your asses AGAIN and obviously never met the dude, but you think she had some storyline with him? Didn't you listen to her? ALSO, am I crazy, or didn't they not ever see his face at that point? They only saw him in his spidey costume right, they didn't see his face yet?

"I'll disagree about the driving part at the beginning because that was the only realistic to ems part. When you drive an ambulance lights and sirens through traffic it's simultaneously dangerous and anti-climactic. The ambulance drivers have seen it all and people react so strange to the truck coming through, stopping in place, or even flipping off the ambulance for inconveniencing them. There's also a lot of mumbled curses when it gets frustrating. However, you can't be so urgent that you make a mistake because that's how you end up with a garbage truck coming through the side of your rig as depicted later in the film.

Also, EMS would never be going into a building on fire from fireworks. The fire crews would be doing those grabs. I'm not sure as the the exact triage protocol in 2003 in NYC but in 2024 she wouldn't have been doing CPR on that guy, he would have been black tagged and she'd be working on a red tag or possibly even still just triaging. I don't think they would have been called in from home to go to the hot job though.

She would have never been allowed to just walk off her drowning either. EMT's very rarely do the blanket and treat at the back step of the truck. It might happen on set for booboos, but 911 is going to be setting up to transport stuff like broken limbs and gsw's.

Anyways movie ADR sucked, especially any time the villain spoke. He sounded like a narrator rather than a character in the room.

The MetroNorth stuff was weird and the Amtrak train that kept repeating in the background of the shot wouldn't have ran into Grand Central at the time. Also the scheme on the outside looked like the modern CDOT scheme so I'm not sure where they filmed.",2024-02-15

The villain's lines are definitely 100% ADR right? Like I don't think they left a single world of whatever he said on set in the film. If you made a drinking game out of his dialogue not matching his mouth you would die and also only not take a shot maybe once.

Also they definitely ADR'd & digitally edited in the 2003 stuff right? Like Dakota Johnson saying she has to ""watch Idol"" and the Martha Stewart reference both feel like they got dubbed in later, and that random Beyonce ad in a back alley is like a painfully obvious addition. The OG cut was definitely set in 1993 and probably somehow inexplicably even worse judging by Ezekiel.",2024-02-17

But for the last part - the vision conversation with the bad guy (which is also the only non-action scene that the two of them share? wtf?)

Ezekiel is really dumb. If your opponent has future sight you never, ever tell them *anything* because you might be in a vision.",2024-02-17
"The scene opens with the microwave beeping, Cassie opening the microwave, the pidgeon hitting the window. I suspect that while the distinction is a small one, Cassie can only see the future, not time travel and that all three of these things were a potential future which never happened.  When Cassie becomes aware of the bird is not when the bird hits the window but instead several minutes earlier. She walks up to the window in the present, likely before even turning on the microwave and changes the future she had been watching. I actually like the causality jolt here because I think it gives genre-savvy viewers the same disconcerting surprise Cassie has in universe since she does not know she is in a movie and still confuses the future with the present.

I doubt it was a simple continuity error, but since it is close enough to being one for most people to break immersion on that it would probably be poor cinematography either way.",2024-02-18

"‚óèWhy was Peruvian Jungle Spider Man wearing normal clothes when Dakota and him found each other? Why wasn't he dressed and painted like in the beginning of the movie? Did he retire? Was it his day off? Did he clock out for the day? Where was his tribe? Were they all drinking beer in front of a TV reminiscing about the good ole tree climbing justice fighting days? Did they die? What's with the disconnect? Plus, she said she'd be there for a week. But we saw the river and cave scene, which took an hour at most, and then she was home again. What happened to the better part of that week? Why didn't he teach her anything? Why didn't we get a Mr. Miyagi montage scene?

‚óèThe characters were so two-dimensional and annoying. The skater girl was a biatch, saying ""Ewww"" to the woman who's water just broke in her home that she let them shelter in for their safety even though it was putting her and her baby in danger. That resentment that Dakota randomly revealed for him mom going to the Peru Jungle while she was 8 months pregnant... isn't that the danger Emma was putting her unborn baby in by prioritizing 3 strangers?

‚óèThe skater girl and all 3 girls didn't cover their faces when they went to the hospital. Why the fuck did they even go with them to the hospital? They should've stayed in the home! But then they didn't even cover their faces. They put hoodies on that didn't even cover their hairlines, and then stuck their faces to the car windows like they were supermodels standing outside a candy shop.

‚óèDakota tells Adam Scott to get Emma Robert's away from them because Vullian guy would leave them alone once they left. Why? Wouldn't the best plan for him be to use them as leverage? Take Adam and Emma and say he'll kill them if she doesn't trade the teenagers?

‚óèAs soon as Dakota radioed in for the ambulance chopper thing to pick them up on the roof, my absolute first thought way ""WHY?! So you can get some innocent emt ambulance pilots killed with your shitty plan?"". She was probably friends with them too. I hate that Main Character plot armor bullshit. Like she put her life on the line to save these 3 strangers, but then gets the pilot(s) of the helicopter killed and doesn't even wince or gasp? Their lives don't matter? Might as well have ran straight to a police station or hospital instead of making up that even dumber plan.

‚óèWhy was the Villian so one-track minded? He's supposedly so smart and far-sighted but doesn't stop to think that he's hell bent on killing them and the only reason he'll see his demise is because of that? Like he had that convo with Dakota in her dream but didn't stop to think about what was happening?

‚óèThe Girls actress showed remorse for a second when she said that she didn't know they'd be teenagers, but then never again. Like she even turned all the lights green without saying anything even though something like that could kill a bunch of innocent bystanders. 

‚óèAlso, what happens to her after Villain dies? She was such a random character and was never mentioned during or after the climax. 

‚óèThe whole Climax of the film on the rooftop was so weird. Also, how did she get paralyzed by falling in the water? Did I miss something? And it looked like the firework hit her hand not her face.
 
‚óèMadame Web? More like Madame Water. She fell and sunk in water 3 times like she was Kevin Costner's long lost daughter in Waterworld.

‚óèTiny detail lol. But when Dakota was wearing her sunglasses after going Blind Professor X on us at the end, you could see her blue unharmed eyes through them. No blindness cgi that they had during the climax.
How fucking annoying was that scene? Weird without being campy. But how annoying was the ""Kung Pow Chicken"", ""Bless you Math Girl"". Like imagine she does that every second. I'd say syonara real fast if I was them.

All in all, I didn't understand the point of this movie. It showed us nothing. It didn't show us what the Villain did after he got the spider and how he got/developed his powers. That could've been interesting so they had to keep it out. It didn't show anything that happened after they defeated him. Not getting their powers or anything. Dakota had basically no damn powers and was physically defeated the first time she used it. Like what was the point of this shit? I really like Dakota Johson, by the way. Actually, she was the only good part about the movie. She brought some light to this shit. Even Adam Scott was somehow boring in this. I don't know how that's possible. 
Like, I wish this movie had the balls to do something, anything! Tried to be funny, or tried to be serious, or tried to be an action, or tried to be scary, or tried to be campy... instead, it tried nothing. 2 hours of nothing. I'd honestly rather watch the elite 50 Shades trilogy again before watching this again. IMO, they were genuinely better movies than this.

"So the film features a Peruvian Spider-Man named Santiago who is the leader of a secret tribe of Spider-People living in the Amazon rainforest, who on finding Cassie Webb‚Äôs dying mother, helped her give birth, before sending her baby (Cassie) into the American foster care system. Like Cassie‚Äôs mother was alone in the Amazon when she died, so Santiago would have had to have flown to New York himself to do this. He tells the baby he will tell her about her history in the future, and Cassie eventually goes back to Peru thirty years later, meeting with Santiago (now wearing an ascot), who shows her the opening scene of the film (with no new information) via a pool.",2024-02-15

Claire Parker¬†(August 31, 1906 ‚Äì October 3, 1981; as well as 2019) was an American engineer and animator.   . A graduate of¬†MIT, her best-known contribution to the history of cinema is the¬†Pinscreen¬†(√âcran d'√©pingles), a vertically-mounted grid of between 240,000 and 1 million sliding metal rods that are first manually pushed into position to create lit and shaded areas, then filmed frame by frame.[1]¬†While the hand-operated, mechanical Pinscreen superficially shares characteristics with early¬†optical toys¬†like the¬†zoetrope, it is distinguished by being one of the first devices ever to produce animation by reconfiguring a set of individual picture elements, later called¬†pixels. A model with sufficient pin ""resolution"" can be used to create a¬†Pinscreen animation¬†of photorealistic images, a painstaking process analogous to modern¬†pixel art.  She later emerged, moldering from her grave, the site of which which gave the cemetery attendant a fatal heart attack.  She proceeded to a coffee shop nearby, where she proceeded to write the Screenplay to ""Madame Web', alongside co-writers Matt Sazama¬†and¬†Burk Sharpless.

"""Pretending""? I wasn't pretending anything, I really enjoyed it. You know it's possible for people to like things you don't? And it was about a team of Spider-Women, you see them fighting in their Spider suits a bunch of times in the movie. Just because it's a non-traditional superhero movie and does an origin story in a different kind of way, I don't think that makes it less of a superhero movie. Again like in my original post, it's like Terminator- how John Connor is GOING to be a resistance leader in the future but you follow him before he becomes that, knowing what he's going to become.  I wouldn't say that makes John Connor less interesting just because we don't follow him being a military leader for the whole movie.

I explained pretty clearly why I liked the movie and why it connected to me so much, you're welcome to disagree with me, but I don't get this idea that if someone likes something you didn't they have to be ""pretending""- people have different opinions and that's okay. This is the kind of movie I enjoy- I also liked Batman and Robin back in the 90s and people crapped all over that back then too. I liked the fourth Indiana Jones movie and people STILL crap all over that (but I don't understand why). I also liked last year's Morbius okay (I'd say about a 3/5) although nowhere near as much as Madame Web. For every movie that's made there are always some people who enjoy it, you know? These movies are made with an audience in mind, clearly it's not the one on here, but they don't just make these for nobody.

If I had to guess, I'd assume (and I am just assuming so correct me if I'm wrong), a lot of people on here enjoy the MCU and that style of superhero movie, and don't like that this wasn't that at all.

 - Ezekial, despite never actually meeting las ara√±cas, designs an almost 1:1 modernised grey version.  
 - Madame Web and her webbing trio all have varying plays on the spiderman suit/insignia, despite MW being the only one to see Las Ara√±cas and being _blind_ at this point, and nobody ever having met Peter Parker as he doesn't exist for quite a while yet. The only person they would have met with a similar suit is Ezekiel, who I doubt they'd want to imitate in any way/shape/form seeing as he's literally the guy that tried to murder them as children.  
 - Peter Parker then 15-20 years later, despite never knowing about the Web sisters, nor Ezekiel, nor Las Ara√±cas, comes up with pretty much the exact same design.  

I get why multi-verse Peter Parkers all end up at near enough the same suit, because they're the same person under varying circumstances. But it repeatedly happening independently within the same storyline is kind of hilarious.",2024-04-01

But to your point, yes - it's been an off couple of years. But it's also worth noting the few years preceding IW/Endgame were major outliers.

That was allegedly the original plot, which was changed when it was realised setting it up in 2003 wouldn't link it to any of the other Spider-Man films Sony made.

The even funnier thing is that changing the targets to the future Spider-Women *could* have made sense, in a way that engages with Spider-Man lore, and could've easily set up a legitimate franchise option for Sony.

The main villain is Ezekiel Sims, who in the comics almost exclusively exists to introduce the concept of Spider Totems (multiversal spider-powered individuals) to the audience.

Have his premonitions be about seeing the Inheritors invading Earth, due to the increased number of Spider Totems, between Ezekiel and the 3 Spider-Woman, that allows a legitimate motive for Ezekiel to want to kill them in a way that's not just ""They'll kill me in the future"".

He's never comes off as overdoing it. Reynolds is in that RDJ camp of over overcharismaing about it but it still works most of the time. Johnson is kinda just unfunny and wooden all around.

Bruh this is the actual film,2024-02-15
"I just came from the cinema. I actually didn't mind the film despite its flaws (6/10), but this is at least a little accurate.

The visions of the girls having powers are from the villain, and those visions are why he's trying to kill the 3 regular teen girls (this is the entire plot, Ben and Mary are irrelevant side characters that could be anyone and have no bearing on the plot other than Madame Web working as a paramedic/being close with Ben). The Pepsi sign IS what kills the villain at the end of the film, and then in the closing, Madame Web also has the visions of the girls getting powers (which confirms they do get the powers, just not in the film, nor is it revealed how they get the powers).

You can tell the film originally was more than it was, but got cut for reasons unbeknown, but if you go into watching it detached from the Spiderman universe like I did; it's a perfectly middle of the road film that should easily appeal to people who don't even like superheros, as the superhero-ness is very subdued.

Seriously though, I don't think anyone giving it 1s, 2s, and 3s out of 10 are being at all genuine. It is FAR from that bad. Lowest grade I'd consider valid would be 4 and I still think that would be harsh.",2024-02-15

This isn‚Äôt relevant. I didn‚Äôt say she was good on SNL or any live TV venue; we were talking about whether she‚Äôs a good actor in general, for the things most big actors act in.

I said SNL isn‚Äôt a normal live performance venue, and being bad at it has zero bearing on one‚Äôs abilities in a medium where¬†they get a bunch of takes of every single scene - that is, every tv show and movie we‚Äôve ever watched or she‚Äôs ever been in.",2024-02-15
"For context, the show SNL is entirely written, rehearsed and performed in a week. The host helps write the material (gives input). They can‚Äôt rehearse until it‚Äôs written. They do the dress rehearsal in the two hours before the show airs (and cut it down to 90 minutes for the televised show by getting rid of the jokes or skits that the audience didn‚Äôt laugh at during rehearsal). Then they do it all again immediately on live TV.

It‚Äôs not even a good indicator of lack of ability to act under normal live audience circumstances, because this is a *tiny fraction* of the time any live stage actor would have to get the same amount of material right. And that‚Äôs fine, because that‚Äôs how SNL is supposed to be.

SNL has literally never ever been a bastion of high quality top tier acting by its hosts. It‚Äôs just about a recurring cast acting with a popular celebrity who does what they can in the absurdly rushed SNL format.

"> The post credit scene in the last Spiderman movie had venom make his way into the MCU and Vulture was moved into the Sony universe. It's not a stretch for others to change universe.

Yes, but this was *Kevin Feige's*/Marvel's doing and *their* creative decisions. Not Sony.

Sony has been trying to milk the rando roster of the few Spider-Man-adjacent characters with hopes of duping people into thinking it's ""the"" new Marvel flick since this plan of operation started back when any Marvel movie was guaranteed to explode the box office.

Venom is a massive staple and understandable that Marvel would want to loophole use of him. But Morbius, Madem Web, etc is purely Sony's desperate attempt to cash in and confuse audiences",2024-02-15
I interpreted that as Marvel confirming that the Sony universe isn't theirs - there'd need to be multiverse hopping shenanigans for any of it to influence the MCU.,2024-02-18
">As of right now, Marvel/Disney owns Spider-man

Incorrect.

Sony still owns spider man, but has agreed to a limited picture deal whereby Marvel/Disney has some say in how he's used (with those films being disney co-productions) in exchange for having him in the MCU.  Once that deal expires, Sony can do whatever they want with spider-man, they just can't use any Marvel/Disney properties.  They can already make non-spiderman MCU films.  They just don't want a second live action spiderman diluting their brand.  

&#x200B;

Disney has no rights to kraven, venom, morbious or madam webb so Sony running them into the ground is only damaging their own brand.  

&#x200B;

Think about that crappy first fantastic four Roger coreman film.  Marvel couldn't sue just cause it stunk.  Many films are shit out just to keep the rights from reverting to their original owners.  

&#x200B;

> They do have movie rights

I should've clarified that this is what I meant.  Sony has distribution rights for Spiderman in movies in perpetuity with a rights reversion clause.  Disney still owns the comic book version of spider man.",2024-02-15
"Disney is definitely pissed, but there is absolutely nothing they can do about it. Sony bought the film rights and as long as they make a film with any of the characters every few years, they will hold them in perpetuity unless they  sell them. They likely wont fuck with Spider-Man, but they still need to make movies, so they release something that they hope will at least make back the budget to extend the rights  another few years",2024-02-15
"Yeah, I can imagine the frustration. If these movies were just mediocre (like the Amazing Spider-Man films) Disney would probably be fine with it; they did include Garfield in No Way Home and I think it went pretty well. But the ""Spider-Man Universe"" movies are a laughingstock.",2024-02-17

The CPR dude is implied to have been hurt in some kind of explosion but he doesn't actually look injured and there are no other signs of destruction.

"I agree to a certain extent. I like movies that are funny, really engaging or at least relatable. I don't give awards poop movies much attention, like I'm not going to get much out of moonlight, Barbie, or the holdovers. There's just no way that I give my time to that creation. I'll watch a trash horror flick with my gf and family before I bother with that. 

I saw Wonka and hated virtually every second of it. However an actually engaging movie like the greatest showman, one of my all time favorites. I like baby driver, Oppenheimer was like the movie equivalent to just getting the job done. I saw everything everywhere all at once and fell asleep it was not fun in the slightest. John Wick was decent, dungeons & dragons was fun. Overall yes I don't really like a story that's not meant to be fun, I can enjoy a movie that's interesting like buried with Ryan Reynolds, but I'm not going to spend my time on a movie like that about a completely unrelatable sequence of events that's also not fun and interesting.",2024-02-15
I honestly have no idea. I think they sent Venom to the MCU in a post credit scene of one of their movies and then the next post credit scene they pulled him back but he didn't actually do anything in between those scenes. Keaton got sucked out of the MCU and sent to the Sony verse in a post credit scene but I'll be shocked if they ever actually do something with that. The whole thing is just a mess,2024-02-15
