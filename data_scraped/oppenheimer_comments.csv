Nolan seriously pulled every string possible for casting in this. It’s amazing how he knew how all of the people he’s worked with before in their secondary roles would be able to fit together into the puzzle, but that’s part of what makes his films enjoyable. David Krumholtz’s physical transformation caught me off guard, and Rami Malek having no lines until the (verbal) bomb drops at the end was outstanding.",2023-07-21 16:09:38

"“Do you want them to tar and feather you in the hopes they’ll forgive you for what you’ve done?”

Emily Blunt delivering the most scathing condemnation of Oppenheimer’s character and actions was so fucking powerful. Mix that in with her portrayal of postpartum depression, a mother and wife resigned to be nothing but a caretaker in the shadow of an ego driven, neurotic, anxiety filled genius and then a powerhouse fighter in the hearing, I think she was a real highlight for me.

The feeling in my theater was palpable after the Trinity Test was successful and everyone on the ground was cheering its success. I don’t know how to describe it but it was kind of out of body to see almost a time capsule of people from 80 years ago celebrating the creation of something that could be the death of myself or my children in the future. Really chilling scene.,2023-07-21 11:31:22
"Ends with American Prometheus realizing the full scope of what still may come to pass.

This movie was fantastic. RDJ gave one hell of a fucking performance in the final act of the movie. As did everyone, regardless of their screen time throughout. Cillian Murphy conveyed so much through his role id be surprised if he didn't win best actor. Emily Blunt gave one hell of a performance and the shot of her reliving her husband's infidelity during the clearance interview was artistically beautiful. A great ""show, don't tell"" moment.

The fact that the pace starts and never really never let's up, but has moments of built tension that doesn't release, and moves on to save for later, makes it feel like it also never speeds up either. Its a marathon, but its paced so well its like you were trained for that marathon. My body felt the three hour run time, but my mind didn't. 

The ending was also beautiful shot, from almost every aspect. RDJ slowly making his way towards Oppenheimer and Einstein, to the content of that teased conversation, to the way it ended.",2023-07-21 08:56:51

Ludwig Göransson might be approaching a Hans Zimmer level of film composer. The way he orchestrated the score adds so much to the tension and anxiety of the movie. Hopefully he picks up the Oscar,2023-07-21 06:48:39
"The biggest thing for me was, just how impactful the first explosion was to the people that were there doing the testing.

They weren’t just creating another bomb, but something terrifying, world ending stuff. 

Nolan really gets that across to the audience. Impactful stuff.

But the size of the explosion threw me off. Because you see stuff [like this](https://youtu.be/NofLHhxHwYk) and the close up shots of the buildings being destroyed, [like this](https://youtu.be/DXg2P9dx-GM).


But to realize a nuclear explosion is just [this](https://youtu.be/8PJEpeU00eU) when viewed from afar, I can now totally see the scale Nolan was going for. It never really occurred to me just how almost simple the explosion could be portrayed, I never put a lot of thought into it. But it’s still so horrifying in its destructiveness.",2023-07-21 04:00:04

"Rami Malek's character (Hill?) was basically the opposite of Strauss. Strauss is met with two minor slights by Oppenheimer, one imagined, and makes it his mission to ruin his life. 

Hill was genuinely dismissed, maybe even bullied, by Oppenheimer multiple times but years later decides to essentially exonerate him in front of a congressional hearing.",2023-07-23 18:40:58

"Cillian Murphy's haunting look at several key points of the film is just amazing. That final conversation with Einstein, his stare is immense and powerful",2023-07-21 09:21:39
"Seen it twice now already. Trinity test scene was remarkable and what most people will see the film for, but there are so many other great scenes. Some of my favorite:

- **""Can you hear the music, Robert?""** The scene where Oppenheimer is told to leave Cambridge and we seem him abroad, looking at art, thinking of the quantum world, all while the beautiful score is played. Such a beautiful montage. It happens early so it's somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes, but make no mistake I think it's one of the best in the film.

- The dinner with Strauss, where they are discussing whether or not there was a spy at Los Alamos and if the Soviets have an H-bomb. I love this sequence, I love the way the music swells, the back and forth between Strauss and Oppenheimer, and how the scene ends with Oppenheimer says something to the effect of ""there was no spy"" and Strauss holds up the data sheet and says ""Robert."" RDJ delivery of that line was like music. I love how everything was played during that scene and how it all culminates with RDJ's delivery of that line. 

- **""I'm taking Kyoto off the list, due to it's cultural significance to the Japanese people. Also my wife and I honeymooned there.""** Fantastic and harrowing scene where they discuss how and where to effectively use the bomb. James Remar is particularly great. 

- The gymnasium scene, after they learned of the Horishima bombing. This was Nolan directing a horror film. First of all I loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene, as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field, resulting in a dream like/nightmare like appearance. This might be Cillian's best scene in the film, watching Oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd, as the reality around him begins to break down, as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in. I love how flat his ""rah-rah"" speech is. And the use of sound here is tremendous. The stamping of the feet, the sound of the crowd going out, the sound of a woman screaming, the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself. 

- The whole last hour is great, but the sequence where Roger Robb is realllyyy starting to grill Oppenheimer and the blinding light begins to fill the room. Acting and editing here was just unreal. 

- The scene with Pash. Casey Affleck's line delivery is so soft spoken, yet unsettling. Really tense scene.

- **""You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do""** I loved that this film used a Rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity. One of my favorites was the scene where Oppenheimer ""humiliates"" Strauss in public over the isotopes. I love when we first see this scene, Strauss appears to take Oppenheimer's jabs with good humor, smiling and shrugging it off, but when the true nature of Strauss is revealed near the end of the film, we see this sequence again, and Strauss looks so angry and humiliated. Also Cillian's line delivery during these moments were so good. I just love how he says ""in fact you do!""



- The final scene where we learn what Oppenheimer and Einstein really said to each other that day. Nolan understands set up and pay off so well. You watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint. The final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust, is incredibly bleak, but much of what Einstein says to Oppenheimer during before this is so sad and god damn poignant. Watching Oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to. The way Einstein sums up the burden of genius, but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age.",2023-07-22 04:02:02

"I knew nothing of the history between Oppenheimer and RDJ’s real life counterpart he was playing. So when in the 3rd act it’s revealed he’s the one orchestrating the campaign to ruin Cillian Murphy, I was STUNNED.

Legit the best twist I seen since LA confidential.",2023-07-21 03:51:17
They made a avengers assemble movie for all the scientists but didn’t give them each solo movies to flesh out their characters. Also that Einstein guy seems like some bait for a prequel movie,2023-07-21 05:04:54
"A film that feels like an enormous pop culture event while simultaneously being a 3 hour, dialogue heavy character study that extensively uses black and white photography. Watching such a film on a massive screen with a sold out crowd is honestly quite unbelievable. In this day in age we almost exclusively expect this for comic book movies and not much else. That thought alone genuinely brought me to the verge of tears multiple times. We just don’t get moments like this very often. Thankfully Oppenheimer is worthy of the moment.",2023-07-21 02:31:31
"I'm just gonna say that the bowls on the table filling up with marbles might be low-key one of my favorite plot devices. 

Most films would give some stupid exposition, try and explain something really fucking complex like bending a piece of paper and poking a hole through it or something. 

Not this film. Nolan just shows marbles filling in some bowls and keeps the film focused on what fucking matters. Brilliant.",2023-07-21 02:56:47

The way my sphincter exploded like the bomb when the audio cuts back in during the gymnasium applause.,2023-07-21 02:08:47
"I love how Nolan played with the differences between the speed of light and sound during the Trinity Test. To convey an awe-inspiring visual spectacle only to be engulfed by the force/sound of it. 

The atomic bomb was a marvelous scientific achievement but then the magnitude of this creation and the harm it will cause literally hits you like a freight train. 

My whole theater was completely silent. It was awesome to be a part of.",2023-07-21 02:17:13

"It’s funny to think that the whole barbenheimmer trend is going to convince more than one casual film goer to see a three hour dialogue heavy biopic.

"I fucking loved this movie. So much tragedy in this movie. Love Emily Blunts line that went something like just because you sin don't expect the world to feel sorry for you. Of course all the conversations with Einstein were great. 
Loved RDJ in the third act
Pacing and editing is so great.

I don’t think it can be understated how powerful that last scene between Einstein and Oppenheimer was. I was already blown away by the film but that scene will haunt me for the rest of my life. 10/10.,2023-07-21 02:16:23
"Had to cancel my tickets for Barbie after, this was intense",2023-07-21 02:27:08
"Here are my main takeaways:
- There were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time. Several names I recognized from textbooks that I didn’t realize knew each other and worked together. It could be because I’m not actively studying scientific journals, but it seems like we don’t have as many Einsteins, Bohrs, and Oppenheimers these days. 
- The movie had way more political undertones than I was expecting. Really highlighted that some of the madness we see in politics has existed for centuries.",2023-07-21 04:00:06
The 5 minutes leading up to the bomb going off had my heart racing,2023-07-21 23:02:22
"The thing that makes this movie incredible is I don't even know where to start with it. Albert Einstein is in just a few scenes and on film for what 5 minutes and the portrayal is amazing and wonderful and heartwarming. There's not a single bad performance in the movie. 

Oldman as Truman is awesome and bold because all Nolan does is portray Truman as he was. If you know history you know Truman is a good man/president and yet he comes off as a total asshole. It's remarkable. 

Downey and Murphy are 10/10. But so are so many others. Blunt is superb. Branaugh is in 2 scenes basically and he's effing incredible. 

The question of if we are doomed is so dark but powerful. And the way the movie used oppenheimer's imagination as surrealism and connects it back to him looking at art is...whew. it's just an awesome, awesome piece of art (the movie I mean). 

I'm a history teacher and I try to convey to students how big a deal the bomb is. It really is a break with the rest of our history as a species and arguably the most important thing we've ever done. It will either destroy us or send us total the stars. This movie summed up all my efforts at teaching this subject and then some.",2023-07-21 02:25:07

"
This movie has possibly created a world record by having the most number of Nobel Laureates on screen. (I counted atleast 10).",2023-07-21 13:37:19
"In my personal opinion the part that's meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering, but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes. A crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb. The movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction. So when he sees people drunk on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of drunk on power. Oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime, but when Truman blew him off and basically said I'm God, oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end. Probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 

Why the ending scene with Einstein should haunt you, is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here. We are the chain reaction, that's when Einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics. So the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away. Makes you think about who you are voting for, how much tech you use, and how we use AI

The movie was a 10/10. But as an engineer that studied nuclear energy I am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved (it was like the art rennisance but for science, the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex. quantum computing in the age of AI)  I already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man. Maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace. Brilliant character study of one of the world's most interesting people. He felt the music, he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher Devine purpose.",2023-07-22 15:34:32
"Everyone acted their asses off in this movie but I will continue to think about Emily Blunt and RDJ's performances. Simply amazing.

I'm glad Nolan restrained himself from showing Hiroshima. Instead he showed Murphy's face who is emoting all the dread and remorse pretty well. The post Hiroshima speech is an all-timer scene.,2023-07-21 10:48:53
Every single casting choice was on the fucking point.,2023-07-21 08:50:08
"- Arguably one of Nolan’s tightest scripts. It felt concise for what it was trying to do, and has hardly any filler scenes. 

- RDJ was incredible. I liked how he was kind of Tony Stark-ish at first, and then he becomes more and more unlikable as it goes on. He’s the front runner for Supporting Actor this year, for sure.

- Matt Damon was an unsung highlight. He was hilarious, and always gave great line deliveries.

- Gary Oldman as Truman was a great cameo. He was such a prick in only 2 minutes of screen time.

- The Trinity Test scene was absolutely breathtaking. The tension, followed by the silence, followed by the sound was thrilling to experience.

- Holy shit, that scene with Oppenheimer giving the speech in the gym and he hallucinates the bomb going off on the crowd. Genuinely one of the most haunting scenes I’ve ever seen.

- The score was fantastic, Ludwig deserves a ton of credit for building up the intensity with his score.",2023-07-21 03:11:49

Very excited to watch Nolan finally take home all the Oscars,2023-07-21 02:12:14
"The trinity test is the biggest reverse card Nolan played on the audience ever.

Everybody was excited for the sound of the explosion and it turns out, the waiting in anxiety for 30 seconds for the sound to hit was the heaviest experience I ever had in a theatre. 300 people dead quiet, you see the explosion, you stop breathing, sweating, 30 seconds feel like 5 minutes.

I had a mini panic attack waiting for the explosion sound and at that point we did not care if the exposion was loud enough, we only cared for those 30 seconds of total silence, sweat and anxiety in hearing the detonation.",2023-07-21 09:37:51
"My screening is about to start and apparently lots of parents didn't get the memo it's an R rated movie and brought their kids. I had Florence Pugh's titties being shown spoiled for me so this should be interesting. Will update.

"The thing that stands out to me the most is how well the film portrays Oppenheimer as a truly complex character that remains sympathetic throughout. A really great performance from Cillian Murphy and an excellent narrative.

"The last scene of the flashbacks near the lake was just incredible. It culminates the entire debate and emotions of nuclear technology used as weapons.

First flashback the audience is made to believe Einstein is upset at Oppenheimer. Second flashback looks like Einstein is upset at Strauss. Final flashback we understand Einstein was upset at himself. It’s the whole debate of who do we blame for everything surrounding nuclear technology. Do we blame the theorist (Einstein), the creator (Oppenheimer), or the user (Strauss). We see all three conflicts in 3 flashbacks to that one scene. Just brilliant.",2023-07-28 03:08:58
"One of the best parts that’s not directly movie related was the exact start time and no movie previews, at least for the IMAX 70mm shows.

"I’m a fan of Nolan. I was so blown away, like many I imagine, the first time I saw *The Prestige* it changed how I viewed movies. I stuck with him through the years, and was continued to be blown away. 

*Oppenheimer* is a larger than life film. Certainly seeing it in IMAX 70mm influenced that feeling, but the film truly felt massive. The non-linear storytelling painted a world so complex and big. The cinematography not only enlarged the characters on the screen, but it amplified the consequences of their actions. The score was perfect. It never missed a beat, and the moments when you were thrown into silence was beautifully garnished by the sound of the projector clicking away over my shoulder. 

I know I’m not going to form a fully unbiased opinion on the film 10 minutes after coming out of my first 70mm IMAX showing in 6 years, so maybe I’ll save that for another time. But what I do want to say:

* The acting was phenomenal. Everybody just melted into their characters so well. RDJ was so great. He was so fucking great. 
* The story also worked well. I liked the ever-present theme of the movie where Oppenheimer was making all decisions rationally, and the others in his life would be corrupted by selfishness, pride, or power. Not to say that’s how it actually was, but it worked as a lens to view through the eyes of Oppenheimer. Nolan made a big deal of the fact he wrote this in the first person, and it showed. 
* I can see why some people preferred the first 2/3s of the movie and didn’t like the last 3rd as much. I still liked the climax and conclusion of the film, especially the ending with Einstein, but that may be something I reconsider when I’m less biased. The non-linear storyline worked, but perhaps it could have been better edited differently. 

Anyway. I’m super happy I got to see it in IMAX 70mm. I’m seeing it again that way on Saturday and will likely return for all the other filmstrip souvenirs. I don’t want analog projections to die and am glad this movie was so good since it makes a great case for it.",2023-07-21 02:13:59
"My wife and I really liked the film. We're Asians who were invaded by the Japanese during the war and seeing the leadup to the trinity test and the explosion was a very emotional experience for us, so much so that my wife wept knowing how much it had actually affected our history; both for good and bad.

The fate of Kyoto partially laying on the nostalgic hands of Henry Stinson’s honeymoon,2023-07-22 09:03:23
"I liked how the script incorporated a lot of small things that get passed around as part of legend, like how Kyoto was crossed off the target list because Henry Stimson had a honeymoon there, the student who dramatically interrupted his haircut to go tell Oppenheimer about the successful nuclear fission experiment he read in the paper, the poisoned apple, the making a bet on total ignition of the Atmosphere, and so on, but I was surprised there wasn't a scene about Fermi accurately estimating the yield of the Trinity test with just some tiny papers, the wind, and educated guesses. Can't include it all I suppose.

The way the movie first incorporated the famous ""I am become Death..."" line felt for lack of a better word *tacky*.",2023-07-21 03:54:44
"Am I over thinking the scene with Jean where they talk about the Bhagavad-Gita?

In the scene in which Jean (Florence Pugh) asks him to read from the Bhagavad-Gita, he starts by trying to explain the context that Arjuna finds himself, but Jean says she wants him to read the words. So he does, ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"".

I don't know if any of you have read the Bhagavad Gita, but the context Oppenheimer is trying to give is that Arjuna doesn't want to commit to war against his kin, but Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) convinces Arjuna that it is his dharma (i.e. ""duty"") to wage war.

The fact that Jean tells him to stop explaining the broader moral quandary that Arjuna finds himself in, and just read the words, seems similar to the expectations laid on him within the military context. It also, of course, reflects broader ideas around ""duty"".

Edit: I welcome any criticisms of my thoughts from members of the Hindu community. It has been a long time since I read the Bhagavad-Gita, and I'm going from memory.",2023-08-01 05:01:33

"The similarity of Oppenheimer to The Social Network is insane to me.

- A relatively popular A-list cast that is performing at their peek.

- A very fast-paced script with little to no breathing room that build up tension as the film progresses.

- A bombastic sound mixing that makes your heart hum to the drum.

- Two key characters that have to deal with the consequences of their brilliances.

"I thought it was alright...

Good stuff:

* Great acting/cinematography/etc all around.
* Some of the key scenes were very memorable (Einstein chitchat, post-blast panic attack, etc)
* Fantastic sound/score. The music as they were raising the bomb into the tower was especially great.
* Act 1 and 2 were structured really well, with the lead up to the trinity test being really fascinating. 

Less than-good-stuff:

* It felt very long. Not sure how to fix that, since so much content was covered with such a huge cast...but I did find myself getting bored at times, especially near the end once it became a full-on political drama and there was no more question of whether or not the bomb could be built.
* There were a lot of continuity errors in the editing...people turned a certain way, or holding something, that then changed/disappeared/didn't-match/etc in the reverse angle of the same shot. I noticed it happen quite a number of times...with the worst offender being a time when Oppenheimer was sipping on a drink in one shot, and then in the reverse angle they cut to, the drink was nowhere near his face (not even visible on screen, despite it being held to his lips before the cut). The editing errors were quite distracting. 

Bad stuff:

* The practical explosion with no CGI was a mistake. It looked goofy and small, like a fireball from a barrel of fuel exploding (which is basically what it was). It had none of the impact that the actual trinity test footage had. It didn't showcase any of the awe and power of an actual nuke...we didn't even get a proper mushroom cloud. It really let down the whole scene and (for me) the whole film.
* The famous bhagavad gita line being a throwaway quote read out during a sex scene, after Oppenheimer's fling randomly picks a book off his shelf and randomly opens to the page/passage containing it was a laughable bad setup for something that should have been one of the most impactful and reflective lines of the film. Just an unthinkably goofy setup.

You obviously see them cheering in the movie, but for us, the audience, we know what terrible consequences this bomb development has caused and, God forbid, potentially may cause.

 Thought all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job, Murphy, Downey, Damon, and Blunt. Love how little CGI was used, and it was refreshing to just see amazing cinematography, acting, and storytelling carry the movie.

"Really impressed by this movie. Not just because it's so visually stunning or because of all the incredible performances, but because this full three hour movie that is mostly made up of people talking or being deposed is gripping the entire time. The score and the editing keep this thing pumping and it's nothing short of awesome how this movie keeps you invested. 

Just a very impressive movie top to bottom. When it comes to the performances I was stricken by so many. Like, Emily Blunt is incredible in this movie but she's like the fifth best performance. Cillian, Damon, Pugh, RDJ, Safdie, they're all absolutely killing it. 

But the heavy lifting Oppenheimer does is propelled so much by the score. This is a lot of scenes of people just talking, but the way it's put together and backed by this in-your-face pulse pounding score you'd think it's some sort of action thriller. But really it's just a movie about chain reactions, about cause and effect. 

It isn't just a bunch of random scenes that tell the story of Oppenheimer, it's a tower that leads to the end of the world, and every brick is built on a moment or relationship that came before it. That's what really kept this thing moving is very rarely was I feeling like something was unnecessary or out of context. Everything in this movie seems to be a direct result of something that happened moments or years before.

It's such classic Nolan to play with the timelines like this, to shake them up and reveal things in multiple scenes at the same time. But what I really loved about this movie is how timelines would catch up to each other or how we would eventually see or hear about a scene multiple times from multiple points of view by the end of it. Ending it with that Oppenheimer/Einstein scene felt absolutely perfect because the movie had me wondering what happened there the entire time. And Alden Ehrenreich being quietly one of the best performances in this movie had that absolute banger of a line ""Maybe it's possible they were talking about something *more important*.""

Speaking of that scene, I know this isn't going to be an unpopular take, but RDJ was unreal in this movie. Not doing his normal thing at all, almost unrecognizable, yet the third act of this seems him as the surprise antagonist and the way he plays it is so fucking good. That subtle insecurity when we first see Oppenheimer mock him in public and the way it obviously had him fucking seething inside but we don't see how much until later, yet it was there in his performance the whole movie. Absolutely masterful stuff. 

Yall, it's an easy 9/10. I can't wait to see it again on an even bigger screen just letting those speakers raw dog my ears.

"The mechanics of every scene mimics that of a  chain reaction, at the start I was unnerved by the staccato nature of the scenes and the dialogue, but by the end you can see that each interaction and consequence is related to the theme of entropy. There is also the subjective perspective of personal memory, which can be surreal at times juxtaposed with the chaos of objectivity…outlined by both the colour shots and the b/w shots. You can see the thread from memento, inception, interstellar and tenet on time, entropy, thermal dynamics, chaos and the human psyche linked to place in it all.

The pace was perfect, the cast was amazing and captured the emotions of the scene at hand almost perfectly.

The way this man can turn his face into being composed, yet absolutely terrified at the same time. His eyes in this movie alone should win its own Oscar for best supporting actor.

Nolan really outdid himself, but this man really needs to learn how to better soundmix his movies. There are so many times on screen where I wished there were closed captions because you have actors using thick accents trying to talk over the background music, which made it incredibly difficult to understand at a few separate points in the movie.

"When the bomb finally went off, I sat there thinking, wait, there's no audio? Then I was like well ... I guess if they're 10 miles away and sounds travels at 340m/s, the observers must have stood there for 30-40 seconds before hearing the... \*booooooooom\*

On a broader note, I thought it was interesting that there were scenes out on the ranch in Los Alamos where I got that same spine tingling feeling that I did watching Interstellar. It felt very much like a Nolan affair.

Ultimately, gotta say that Nolan absolutely nailed it on this one. Extremely glad that I went and saw it in 70mm - this is definitely one to see in the Cinemas.",2023-07-21 02:30:34

"A lot of movies criticism is the third act sucks but with this movie it was the opposite, I enjoyed the third act (post Trinity test) the most, best part of the movie was seen Oppenheimer grapple with his guilt as well as RDJ scenes. I also especially liked Oppenheimer scene with Truman, Gary Oldman short apperance in the movie stole the show. It's funny also how Nolan treated Kennedy like a marvel teaser when he was mentioned (like what he did with Robin in DKR)",2023-07-23 17:10:01
"It was a good film.

I went in with 0 expectations of actually seeing THE two nuclear bombs in Japan so I wasn't disappointed when that didn't happen.

Nolan's choice of having Oppenheimer sit through the presentation of the horrors of the aftermath but not showing us what Oppie is seeing was effective in creating dread without showing it.",2023-07-23 23:23:48
"Heard a lot of chatter about poor representation of women in the film before it’s release, but after watching it I honestly don’t think that’s was the case, not that I’m any expert on the subject. 

Florence Pugh’s character got very little screen time but her role was impactful and tragic. On the other hand, Emily Blunt was fantastic. She went from a reserved and quiet character serving as further exposition of Oppie’s life, who seemingly would have a very small role, into an extremely animated character with a lot of gravitas. Her cold rage grew as she watched Oppie cheat throughout the years, and while she rightfully let some of it boil over onto him, it truly showed its face as she displayed the anger and vindictiveness I expected out of Oppie himself during his political crucifixion. It seemed that in the aftermath of his political blacklisting that Oppie was extremely reserved and almost resigned, no doubt in part due to guilt over the Pandora’s box he opened, and the realization he had no power or platform at all to control its future course. On the other hand, Emily Blunt brings a cathartic sense of righteous anger to the whole situation which balanced with Oppie’s nearly constant broken stare and acceptance. The scene where Kitty refuses Teller’s handshake is almost as satisfying as when RDJ’s character finally gets his comeuppance. You could also see the exact moment when the dissenting judge flipped to Oppie’s side while listening to Kitty’s indignant testimony. Definitely one of my favorite characters from the film, perhaps second only to the man himself and Einstein who was awesome.",2023-07-24 03:00:13
"Minor spoilers follow (in as much as one can have spoilers for a historical drama).

I have been thinking about this movie for two days after having seen it. Obviously a good sign. During that time I have seen commentary to the effect that the trailer is misleading.

I agree.

I thought the drama and excitement was going to come from the Manhattan project. That is what the trailer seemed to be presenting. But it didn't. It came from the interpersonal drama. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was not what I felt I had been set up to see.

Interestingly, the very few and brief scenes where the project itself is the focus carry a lot of emotional impact. The original ""marbles in a jar"" scene was an ""oh my"" moment. The occasional but recurring shots of the implosion core partially surrounded by explosives were appropriately menacing. These were great scenes, but they were few and far between.

As the movie ended I reflected on why there was so much focus on Lewis Strauss, and in the end I decided that Nolan probably wanted to give the titular character ""justice"" at the climax, and given the factual history, there weren't many ways to do that.

My frustrations peaked in the scenes where they described both Einstein and Oppenheimer as mathematically sub-par. This is a horrible fiction - particularly in the case of Einstein - that seems to be fed to children who aren't strong in mathematics to prevent them from feeling discouraged. But at this point it has become received wisdom and seems to be accepted generally as a historical fact. The national geographic series ""Genius"" promoted the same egregious fiction (amongst its many other rewritings of history, but let's not go there). No, adults ought not still believe in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny either.

Artistically the film was a technical tour de force, but challenging. For the first couple of minutes I thought we were being treated with a montage of events to put the audience into the context, and then the movie proper would begin. But scenes continued to be machine-gunned at me right up to the actual trinity explosion at which point everything comes to an abrupt halt, and the score was written in the same way. Artistically, I get it. it's a deliberate choice to make the trinity test an inflection point, not just in the plot but in the very construction of the movie. I personally felt it sacrificed too much for the eventual effect, but I respect the artistic choice.

Part of what spoiled that punctuated moment for me was the jarringly underwhelming explosion from the test. Going into the movie I wondered whether they might take historical footage and touch it up (the trailer actually does this). I expected the initial jellyfish-like fireball, so intense and massive that its barely translucent surface looks almost uniform, and a sense of scale provided by the shockwave in relation to the surrounding terrain. (Go and watch the original trinity footage to see what I mean if you've never seen it). But no, what we got was a close-up of a rolling fireball with some sparks. The kind movies often produce by setting off a detonator inside a bag of gasoline. To make matters worse, when the shockwave hit the prone observers it looked like some prop handler just off camera threw half a bucket of dirt into the scene from the left.

All that said, I still enjoyed the movie for what it was even if I felt misled by the trailer, and I did appreciate the artistry of the direction even if it didn't quite work for me personally. All of the acting was faultless, even though the amazing cast was barely given a chance to act for the first half of the movie because of the brevity of each scene. The moment when Raimi Malek says ""thank you"" on being offered a chance to speak (after merely 3 brief scenes for this A-list actor - during which he was very conspicuously given no lines) was a clever and subtle 4th wall breaker. And I was chuffed by a few historical easter eggs (Feynman on his bogo drums, for example).

An excellent movie, despite being unsatisfying.",2023-07-24 15:59:16

"Not a comment on the film but reactions to people wishing to have seen more of the science in the film. My original trajectory in life was to be a physicist, and I made it to college with that intent, but had to drop before finishing due to illness, so seeing the parade of names in this film was incredible to me. I originally started that track after being introduced to Richard Feynman's work as a sophomore in high school. 

The reality is, theoretical physics can't be reduced into layman's terms in an easily digestible way, like many other sciences. You either lay the groundwork for understanding, or you explain it in a way that is generally wrong. I think Nolan opted to avoid it in order to prevent having to contort representations of the greatest minds the world had to offer, saying things that were flat-out incorrect. That's why there were only really broad surface statements about ""a photon is both a particle and a wave"" or ""we can cause a cascade."" Once you get beyond that point, you have to either go way to far into detail or be wildly inaccurate in your explanations. Those explanations wouldn't be something that the people in those rooms would require anyway, so that would feel weird in itself.",2023-08-02 06:07:06

That's unfortunate. Unless you have an awesome sound setup at home, the best part of this movie will be lost.

The movie didn't really have much to say for me. Of course Oppenheimer was conflicted about what he created. That's a given for anyone who isn't a psychopath. 

Nolan has a problem with actually approaching human emotions. It's almost like he's afraid to, and I think it hurts his movies. They're all too cold and clinical.",2023-08-07 13:50:17
"It finally released here in South Korea, and it was so good! Koreans generally don't learn much about Trinity and Oppenheimer in school - the country was a bit busy being severely oppressed by imperial Japan at the time it all went down. (It's the same reason World War 1 history outside Korea isn't well-known - Korea was under Japanese rule for a *long* time.) So this movie is the first time some Koreans will learn more than the basic trivia - and it does a pretty good job of teaching. I think it'll inspire a lot of Koreans to do some research and learn the true facts.

The casting was absolutely wonderful, especially Gary Oldman as Truman. I wish we could see some of the actors from this movie play the same roles in other movies - we need more scientist biopics!",2023-08-15 09:47:05
"Watched the movie last afternoon. I kinda had to let everything sink in. This movie is definitely gonna stay with me for a long time.

Apart from the fact that every performance is really good, the writing is just so tight. Also the fact that it's 3 hours, non stop, tons of dialogue and somehow it didn't lose me for even a minute. It was so fascinating. All aspects. The science part of it, Oppenheimer's personal life, the questioning of Oppenheimer/Strauss, the horror of the bomb. Legit I got shivers sent down my spine multiple times.

When everything came together with the final scene with Oppenheimer's and Einstein at the pond, the music getting louder, I legit teared up. I never quite experienced anything like it. It's without a doubt the best movie I've seen in years, maybe ever. 

I didn't think the movie would affect me this strongly.

Performance wise I think most would agree that Murphy, Blunt and RDJ are the MVPs, but those that also stood out to me where Benny Safdie, Alden Ehrenreich (especial his last line) Rami Malek and the actor who played Einstein.",2023-09-05 12:45:48
"Crazy how people can react so differently to the same movie. This was IMO easily Nolans best work. And more then anything his most emotional. The genius of it is that he gets you to feel not for the characters sake but for our own. 

Every day we ignore the elephant in the room who at any time could destroy us all. More then anything this flick makes you take a second to see the elephant for what it is and why it was created in the 1st place and it's probably the heaviest horror movie of all time because of it. 

He's always trying to use the visual and audio components to tell the real story and that never worked so well as it did for this flick. It helps to see it on the big screen or on a good at home atmos setup for instance given what he tried to achieve here.  

To make a movie like this where no matter your opinion on atomic bombs going in, you get to see every angle, justification and reason for why he did what he did was remarkable. The audience is pushed to change it's pov like Oppenheimer did himself. To see the logic of his choices and eventually deal with the weight of those choices much like he had to.",2023-12-03 11:24:35

"Been trying to think of a way to sum up my feelings on this movie, which I thought was *really really* good but not quite ""*great*."" 

Almost everything that I thought detracted from the film involved putting so much emphasis on Strauss. Some of this is that I just found that story, of his failed appointment, kinda... low stakes? Compared to everything else the story was talking about? Some of it is that I personally am not a big fan of RDJ's acting (although he did a good job here, just playing a character I wanted to see less of from a story perspective). Either way I couldn't help this nagging feeling anytime we were in Strauss's black-and-white scenes that I'd rather be seeing what Oppenheimer's up to. 

Comes down to it, I think I would have preferred if the story were more linear and stuck with Oppenheimer's point of view -- still keeping in how angering Strauss led to Strauss orchestrating Oppenheimer's sham-trial denial of his security clearance. It's too big of a part of Oppenheimer's life story to not include it. I just didn't feel like they needed to frame so much of the tale as coming from Strauss's perspective, framed from *his* motivations as a character. He's just not that interesting to me, I'd rather have either cut that and made a slimmer film, or used that time to deeper explore Oppenheimer's post-bomb regrets and disillusionment of the era of the peaceful scientist-king. 

*Or*, something that I felt was missing, explore Oppenheimer's sense of empathy or whatever it was that led him to feel connected to left-wing causes, to support the Spanish Republicans, to attend unionization meetings, etc. This film sets up the non-renewal of his Q-clearance as the dramatic crescendo, not the bomb, and the non-renewal happened because of his close connections to communists and communism, but we're given scant connection between him and those beliefs. People, yes, but not the ideologies. 

I loved nearly everything else about it. Not a single low point for any acting in any role. I actually thought the practical work for shooting Trinity was great, especially their use of color. Those deep magenta streaking glows after the flash gave a Dante-esque hellish vibe that I thought really fit what they were going for. I've heard the sex scenes described as superfluous, but from my perspective, those and the constant referrals in exposition back to his affairs and cheating told an important part of Oppenheimer's story -- he was a insatiable horndog whose horny-ness got him into trouble, usually in ways he thought he could just ""I'm a smart sensitive lad look at me"" his way out of. 

The “You don't get to commit the sin and get us to feel sorry for you because it has consequences"" line is so good, and the delivery of it was excellent. I really thought that was the theme of the whole film. His interaction with Truman is just an echo of that same line from Kitty: Motherfucker, you knew you were building a bomb, did you forget those kill people? You don't get to build a super weapon and then cry when it gets used. Or, you can, but if you do everyone is going to call you a crybaby and a hypocrite. You don't get to cheat on your wife and still need her to console you when your mentally unstable mistress kills herself. Or, you can, but if you do, she's going to call you out on it. 

The only thing holding it back was the need to have some chunk of the story come from Strauss's perspective. It feels weird to say ""I wish this was more of a straight-forward biopic"" considering it's Christopher Nolan, but I kinda wish this was more of a straight-forward biopic?",2024-01-14 18:09:49

"A few themes and patterns that I noticed in the movie, which may be open to interpretation, but I'll give my own. Maybe these have been discussed in this forum before or have different ways of looking at them, but I wanna give my thoughts:

&#x200B;

1) **Fusion and Fission**: The First scene starts with Fusion (black and white) and Fission (color). My first question was how are the colors related to Fission and Fusion. 

***My theory:*** 

**Fission** is splitting of atoms, or division of one thing into smaller things. The color scenes in the movie are the scenes from Oppi's perspective. This represents how he (like Prometheus) is distributing himself to the world (metaphorically speaking). This happens from different perspectives: Scientific, political and even in his humanitarian efforts later on. He just wanted to give more of himself to the world. Just like splitting an atom gives a huge amount of energy, his contribution did the same

**Fusion** on the other hand is like forcibly pushing two particles together. The black and white scenes in the movie are the facts in the movie, or shall I say, how the world perceived and reacted to Oppenheimer. This represents the opposite both in the scientific phenomena and in the movie with Oppi. The world constantly tries to push him, with his duality in his nature constantly being pushed together. It's most clear after the bomb, when the feeling of relief in the success of the bomb is juxtaposed with the horrific nature of the tragedy. Oppi constantly feels fused by various elements and to some degree, his own work in fission and fusion (another play they did in the movie)

I don't know how much of this was intended, but in any case, they really paid attention to the details for this.

&#x200B;

2. **Lack of glamour:** This has been addressed earlier by other people and my take on the fact that people feel that there were no grand explosions, or deep exploration of relationships in some cases, or the movie being long/boring; is this:

'Are you watching closely?'

The Prestige, a movie where he laid some of the foundations of what he wants to do in his movies includes his very important line. He wants you to pay attention to every single detail. Of course, this is difficult and sometimes even more so due to sound mixing issues but there are advantages to this.

First, it's a great repeat experience and second, if you understand his philosophies, the movies become a 100 times more rewarding.

In the case of Oppi, Nolan set the stage and the tone of the movie that this is NOT a movie about a hero or a villain, it's not a fictional tale. Nolan's choice of basing the event on reality includes a very important point: Perspective. He does not want you to show you the perspective you want, but the perspective that existed. 

Regardless of how underwhelming it is, that was reality. 

The emotional relationships, especially with women, was (at that time) much less important with the fear of death and war at your doorstep. 

The explosions were not heard or seen, but felt. No one saw what happened in Japan. We are privileged to see them in 2023, so we think, ah it could be better if I could see the horror and feel it. But the true horror is in the reactions, the celebrations, the paradoxes and what follows after.

The bomb was not the climax of the movie, the courtroom drama was, in my humble opinion. The whole movie was building up to how traumatic this experience is as an individual and how ruthless society is : JUST LIKE A BOMB IS.

&#x200B;

He showed the implications of the bomb by making you feel the implications of the bomb, rather than show it. He showed what it meant to be in the new world.

&#x200B;

And just like the great Robert Downey Jr's character failed to understand, so did many people, that this movie is about more than the self-importance of individuals, it's more than the self-importance of explosions and crucially more that the self-importance of Oppenheimer.

Kennedy would be running for president the next year lol. He was a star by then. Kinda felt like cutesy forrest gump way to shoehorn in a reference that kennedy voted to deny strauss.

My big criticism against the movie is how poor the female characters are.  Which sadly is the Nolan mo with underwritten female characters. Glad to see Olvia Thrilby again, Florence kind of came off a bitch and Emily Blunt’s character felt like an entire missing arc.  She is introduced as a crazy drunk (when its postpartum) and then the film kind of doesn’t develop her or why stayed with Oppenheimer with the constant cheating and being absent.

"Finally got to seeing this before it ended its theatrical run! Holy capola, 20k comments!

Completely different film from what I was expecting-not necessarily in any negative way.

Primarily right off the bat, the pacing seems peculiarly fast. Particularly with his love interests, their exchanges come off as these quick back-and-forth quips like it's a dress rehearsal or something. But I was able to get on board with the overall cadence, expecting it to be an intentional build up to the climax.

On that point, you go into this movie expecting to be wowed by the sight of an atomic bomb, but in the end, you find yourself much more blown away by the sound design than any of the visuals, interestingly enough. The explosion of the trinity test was a bit disappointing, I have to say, but I couldn't help but admire the manipulation of senses and making us ""disappointed"" with the visuals of it playing out muted to follow up and shock us with the sudden return blast of sound-of course emulating the real life experience of being in the presence of the explosion. There were a handful of moments other than that that they used a sudden jolt of volume so strikingly it could damn near be considered a jump scare. The intercuts to the visualizations of the science behind the bomb were also just as effective with the sfx in terms of establishing the eerie, cosmic, anxiety-filled atmosphere. Lastly, the score and sound design contributed such a great deal to making a 3 hour feature consisting mostly of dialogue not have a single dull moment.

It's not a perfect film by any means, with its flaws honestly ranging from amusing to laughable to comparable to the most mainstream generic popcorn flicks. The fetishization of Oppenheimer learning Sanskrit and Jean Tatlock randomly happening to point out the ""I am become death"" part of the book for him to read aloud was pretty ridiculous; the camerawork with Jean fucking him in that small room where the hearing took place when Kitty was forced to hear his confession was way more gratuitous than artful; Robert Downey Jr's character being revealed as the evil mastermind behind things in the third act was rather melodramatic; Nolan has never really been known for his women/wife characters, and while she's probably his most unique so far, Kitty felt like such a bizarre, alcoholic, plot device presence (except for maybe her highlight scene being interrogated in the hearing); etc. Japan has a whole subgenre of atomic bomb literature, a bit of which I've read, so I guess was pretty nitpicky about the ""effects of the bomb"" depictions they did. The molten skin on the girl kind of just seemed like simple tape make-up/the peeling of very superficial layers, and the charred corpse he stepped on had a long crack on it like a vase when I feel like something to that degree would just disintegrate; I don't know, felt like it could've been more viscerally grotesque to show the true nature of its effects.

The ensemble cast has been talked about for so long before the movie even came out that I was surprised to both see who actually had important roles beyond a couple of lines and who I ended up liking a lot. Was not expecting Matt Damon to be depicted as Oppenheimer's biggest bro-perhaps other than Izzy (and ol' Albert, lol)-kind of doubt it was that way in real life though since he was spending every day with his fellow scientists and only meeting with Groves every so often. We jokingly referred to Lawrence as the Captain America of the scientist Avengers since he was such an All-American chap, lol. Didn't really buy Casey Affleck as a cutthroat colonel or Russian. Dane DeHaan played an annoying little shit well. Even now, reading the Wikipedia article, I'm surprised to find out about the actors I didn't recognize. That was my girl Olivia Thirlby from Dredd in her first movie role in 4 years?!

The editing alongside the sound design is another unexpected element that carries this film and definitely something worth marveling upon rewatch. One subtle thing I really liked was whenever a particularly minor/hard to remember character's name was mentioned, they did this just the perfect amount of short cut/flashback to a scene of theirs just so we could catch a glimpse of their visage and hopefully be reminded who they were.

For whatever reason, I assumed Albert Einstein was going to be limited to just one/scene cameo. My friend and I turned him into a running gag joke of being this Hannibal Lecter/godlike being too larger-than-life to be directly involved in mortal affairs that Oppenheimer could only go to for vague worldly advice. The scene where they're outside at night, the car drives out of frame, and Einstein appears out of nowhere like some homeless raccoon had us laughing our asses off.

The last scene involving Einstein was killer though. Wrapped up the entire film just short of masterfully. I actually had been spoiled about that line of dialogue ""Is it possible they didn't talk about you at all? Is it possible they talked about something more important?"" beforehand, but it still hit hard.

\~8.9/10 for me upon first watch understanding like 75% of the dialogue without subtitles, lol.",2023-08-30 07:49:01
"Loved it. 

Strictly talking about secondary characters, I was mostly impressed with somone not mentioned that much in this movie's discourse, that being Casey Affleck as Boris Pash. He was TERRIFYING. Only had two scenes, but with how Nolan cut Groves talking about him and the actual meeting with him, I had shivers down my entire spine.

Jason Clarke as Roger Robb was incredibly electric. He was infuriating, portraying the perfect sleazy public prosecutor, and he brought in some of that nuclear energy they used for Fat Man and Little Boy.

Benny Safdie was fantastic as well. He's never been sweatier, but he was incredible. Edward Teller was definitely the standout in that whole pack of scientists.

I found it interesting how they didn't bother to make Josh Hartnett's Lawrence any older than just a bit of grey on his perfect hair. You had there horribly old Oppie, Kitty, Frank, Rabi, and then good ole Hartnett, made me chuckle. 

Josh Peck and Devon Bostik I felt were really underutilized. I can understand why, and maybe they simply had no big role in the true story, but them two were particularly hyped actors for this film, and did little to nothing. I was surprised to see that the two that flew under the radar in terms of casting but that delivered one hell of a performance were Alden Ehrenreich and Dane DeHaan.

On a sidenote, I don't understand how nobody recognized Gary Oldman as Truman, he looked way more like Oldman than he did in Darkest Hour, for example. Just a bit fatter, with whiter hair, but that face was pretty much Oldman. 

All this said, the true star of the film is the combination of Nolan's directing, Van Hoytema's cinematography and Göransson's original score. Each one of these elements elevated the other and vice versa, making for one of the most immersive and impressive cinematic experiences in my memory.",2023-08-30 17:00:54
"Just watched it in IMAX and thought the movie was briliant. The cast was fantastic and everyone played their role in an amazing fashion. 


The only criticism I have about the movie is the pacing of the first half / two-thirds of the movie (up to the interrogations becoming more the focal point). The editing was too fast in my opinion. It felt like I was watching a stretched-out movie trailer with a big amount of very short snippets of multiple conversations being thrown at the viewer. They could've reduced the tempo a little bit on that regard, but I did feel like they rectified that in the later parts of the movie.",2023-08-30 22:03:37

Non-controversial opinion: this is the most invested I've been in a dialogue-focused film since Margin Call.  Nolan did an amazing job at creating suspense, action, and horror through just a bunch of people talking.  

I will absolutely be going to see this again before it leaves theaters.",2023-07-21 02:24:25

They can be petty, vindictive and flawed like Strauss and yet they still hold the power to end the world. The technology is frightening by itself, but putting into the hands of fallible men is where the true horror lies.",2023-07-22 16:08:32

"
Underwhelming. But I kinda expected that from Nolan. Christ Christopher can you shoot an actual wide shot? Somebody needs to teach this man to use a lens that is wider than 50mm.

Acting was top notch. But some of the dialogue was ropey. Nobody talks like that in real life. Nothing more apparent than that than Florence’s first introduction. 

There’s no heart to this movie it feels very cold and clinical like all Nolan movies. There’s no punch. At the end it really didn’t feel like it said anything even if I did enjoy watching the 3 hours of it. Some beautiful shots but once again nothing that really sears into my mind the tremendous weight of it all.

What I got out of the film is that Oppenheimer is a flawed man who reveled in being a genius. He seemed to struggle with the tension between being a great inventor and the morality of escalation of arms. I think you could tell that story with far more economy than this film did.

The race against the Nazi's never felt like a looming threat in the film. It was stated, but never pressured onto the story imo, and therefore lacked additional thrill - which I was expecting. The courtroom drama was pretty mundane in comparison to the trinity test. Blew a lot of steam going in to the 3rd act, and it's kind of hard to top a nuclear explosion.

"The gym/speech scene was so flawlessly executed. I can give some personal insight to this as well and why this scene was portrayed the way it is. A few months ago, I took a little too much shrooms and ended up going through drug induced psychosis (which involves high levels of anxiety, paranoia and hallucinations). When the background started to shake behind him, I knew what was about to happen because that’s how it felt to me. Damn near had a panic attack in the theater because it took me back to that horrible experience and made me relive those memories. This scene was incredibly accurate and portrayed perfectly what extreme paranoia and schizophrenia/hallucinations are like.

Everything from the confused feeling, to hearing sounds (like the screaming), misinterpreting faces and other people’s emotions (like the woman crying), or straight up hallucinating visuals (like the couple making out or the guy throwing up, which is basically how you feel on the inside but projected outward by your brain into the environment) was horrifically accurate. Props to Nolan for conveying this feeling/experience so well—not sure how he did it unless he went on a trip himself lol

Apologies if this doesn’t make much sense, I tried to put my thoughts into words as best as I could. I wish I could use the excuse that I’m not a native English speaker but I am, haha. Can’t wait for Nolan’s next project :)",2023-08-25 05:08:53
"Finally saw Oppenheimer today, and really enjoyed it. I noticed some symbolism which I haven't seen mentioned in any other online forums and I'm curious what you all think of this theory:

Are the horses in the movie, (especially the white horse) a metaphor for death?

When Oppenheimer rides to Los Alamos desert with Lawrence and his brother (before the Manhattan project), they bring four horses. Each of the three people ride dark horses, and Openheimer also leads a white riderless horse along after them. Shortly after, there is a nighttime scene in which camera is framed so that the white horse appears as a blurry spectre immediately behind Oppenheimer, almost like his own shadow or spirit. 

The four horses of the apocalypse is a classic Biblical symbol, especially when there are three dark horses and one white horse (i.e. the pale horse of death). It doesn't seem like this could be a coincidence, since the plot gives no reason why the three riders would go through the trouble of bringing a fourth riderless horse way out into the desert with them.  The only reason to include the riderless fourth white horse is for the symbolism of Openheimer leading Death to this site.

Horses are also associated with death in other scenes like when Oppenheimer dreams he is feeding his horse an apple causing him to suddenly wake up to >!take back the poisoned apple he left on his professor's desk. !<

>!Horses are also a part of the scene where he goes out in the wilderness alone after learning about Jean's suicide. The camera shows us the horses first, before we see him sleeping behind a boulder.!<

I'm sure there are also scenes with horses that aren't associated with death, like when he has a romantic ride with Kitty shortly after they first met. But the overall metaphor seems strong and clear to me despite those exceptions. If I watch it again, I'll have to pay more attention to the color of the horse in each seen to see if it was consistently the white horse associated with death, and also if there are any scenes in which someone rides the white horse or if it's always riderless and being led around by Openheimer.",2023-08-28 06:57:53

Are we supposed to know who this Strauss character was and his relevance from the beginning? I'm not American so not sure if he is well known.

Then, as the film went on, all I could think was ""This man is trying, in some way, to atone for what he did and what he birthed. He's letting his name be dragged through the mud because he feels he deserves it"". 

Then Kitty delivers that line...

Seeing Rami Malek tear apart Strauss in the hearing was so satisfying to watch. Him trying to look calm and composed as his life's ambition is left in bloody tatters in front of his face was incredible. Equally, him thinking that Oppenheimer wanted it all to be about him, only to see that it's actually him thinking it's all about him was great too.

Honestly, to me, this is Nolan's best film. It's a spectacle without being a spectacle. Not seen enough love for Ludwig Göransson's score either, which made me feel like I was watching an opera, which suited it perfectly.

Will be very surprised if Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jnr. aren't at least nominated for the Academy Award. I think DiCaprio and DeNiro will both give them a run for their money after *Killers of the Flower Moon*, but they have a very good chance of winning here.

"There are some Japanese people flew to the US just to watch the movie because it is not released in Japan.

Truman asked Oppenheimer in the movie,

""Do you think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit who built the bomb?""

Japanese people do truly care about who built the bomb.

Einstein once recounted his distress at Japanese people asking him why he built the nuclear bomb, and he had to repeatedly tell them and anyone else who asked that all he did was write a letter to FDR urging him to research nuclear weapons since the Nazis were doing the same.",2023-10-17 14:20:43
"I loved the movie in IMAX. I get people seeing a three hour trailer, but nearly 40 years of a guy's life with some thematic liberties is a tough pitch for even three hours. Nolan pulls it off. The acting is great, but the music is the most amazing thing about the movie. The bomb explosion I have to admit looked lackluster on a first view, but then in my research of the explosion, I found that my perception of atomic bomb blasts is that they are all massive. They are all big, but not all massive.",2024-02-20 19:11:29
"Not sure how exactly to put it into words, but the movie does a fantastic job of showing the inertia (for lack of a better word) of making the bomb. No one person is responsible. As much as the film shows Oppenheimer to be the man in charge of it's creation, it's clear the government was going to do it regardless of which scientists came on board. Once the breakthrough was known, it was going to become a bomb one way or another. It ties so well to the scene in the lab with the scientists realizing that it was theoretically possible to do, and how they began with pure childlike excitement and then quickly realized what it meant. It really brings home the fact that mankind can be so self-destructive. We use our collective brainpower to invent exciting new technologies and then use those new technologies to kill.

Just think about the absurdity of the thought process: ""the Nazis are probably going to create this bomb that could blow up the whole world, so we better hurry up and create one first"". It would be funny if it wasn't so real and dark.

It reminded me of an older podcast I listened to, may have been radiolab. They are interviewing a team that had worked on the stuff that has led to modern day deepfake videos. Voiceover fakes and facial manipulation and the likes. Stuff that was exciting tech, but really a solution to small issues. She gave an example of instead of an actor having to fly in to do reshoots, now they can use the tech and do it all in the editing booth. Which, fine yeah that's great. But the interviewer says surely you can foresee the nefarious uses for this tech (this was a few years before the explosion of deep fakes). You can tell that they thought about it but they just said something like it's their job to create the tech once it's clear that it's possible to do.",2024-03-14 13:00:10

"Oppenheimer is even better on a 2nd watch. I went in with a better grasp and understanding of the story this time, so I didn't feel overwhelmed with the amount of information Nolan feeds you. The narrative thread was clearer to me which made the whole film even more emotionally impactful. Especially that crucial scene between Oppenheimer and Einstein at the lake, tying up the black and white version at the beginning with the color one at the end, worked in a tragically epic fashion. One of the best film endings I've ever seen.


It's so impressive to me that Nolan managed to make an 180min film, that is filled to the brim with dialogue and exposition scenes, feel like a 90 min action film. The pacing and the editing were off the charts imo. I never felt the full runtime of this film. It reminded me of Zodiac and JFK, two of my favorite films when it comes to pacing, storytelling and editing.",2023-07-31 23:14:39

"Biopic is my least favorite genre, and I didn't like Nolan's last few films like at all. So I was seriously considering passing on this film, but my thought was changed after finally watching it in the theater. I liked it much more than I expected. It might be my new favortie film of Nolan.

I really liked Nolan's approach here. He made the biopic almost like a political thriller. I think it was the right choice to choose a story structure where the past and present intersect constantly. It was a bit jarring until I got used to it, but once it clicked, I was immediately immersed in the movie. If the story had progressed chronologically, the hearing scenes might have been very anticlimactic.

Thematically, I loved Oppenheimer's internal conflict about the nuclear bomb. He was proud of what he and coworkers had achieved, but he felt deeply guilty about what the nuclear bomb brought to the human races. It was out of his hands once it was made, but he couldn't be free from responsibility since he contributed to its creation. I found the irony of the fact that an invention that could bring about the end of humanity to be the only solution to end a terrible war very interesting. It's a weapon of mass destruction for sure, but if he hadn't built the nuclear bomb, someone else surely had done. I'm not saying he didn't have a choice, but who could blame his choice after all? What would you have done if you were in his position? I don't think there was a right or wrong answer here.",2023-09-01 06:17:21

I felt like it took away from the urgency and drive to get the bomb completed when the film keeps cutting to after the success of it in the trial scenes. Given that the big drawing scene of the film is the trinity test, I would have liked the entire film up to that point to revolve around it. And I would have liked a scene or two to show the pressure of the Nazis or Japanese enemies to further drive it home cuz this is WW2 dammit. The constant timejumps also made it hard for me to keep track of the many,many characters in this film.

"Saw it today in 70mm IMAX at Irvine Spectrum. Other than what looks like specks of dust throughout the film and the entire screen turning black for about a second around the point after the sex scene, where Murphy and Pugh are talking, the movie went well. I don't know if 70mm IMAX is necessary for a film like this, but damn, does it pull it off well. When Nolan said he purposely filmed this in 70mm, I believe it. The sound mixing is incredible. Some bone-shaking moments especially the first 30 minutes and towards the end. The shots where the entire screen fills up look amazing. Sort of in awe whenever it happens. 

I'm a sucker for sound/audio and watching this in this format confirmed for me that sound is the most important quality in making a film. My only complaint about it is that the dialogue was tough to hear throughout the film. Background music being played for like 90% of the film is an interesting choice although I guess that's Nolan's thing.

As for the film, at least for me, it feels like it requires multiple viewings. 99% dialogue. Tons of characters. I lost focus a few times during the first 1.5 hours, but the third act picks up. That ending though with the soundtrack accompanying it. Sheesh.",2023-08-04 05:24:39

"This is definitely gonna require a rewatch or two more, but I think this was definitely one of Nolan’s best films in years, and maybe his best work from his filmography yet.


The cast, including supporting actors and even actors that just literally showed up for a scene, were fantastic and firing on all cylinders. I was amazed by the amount of faces I saw that I didn’t know were involved; Casey Affleck (who was terrifying in his brief appearance as a understated, sociopathic intelligence officer), Alex Wolff and certainly not Gary Oldman. All phenomenal.

The two leading standouts though are obviously Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I’ve been waiting for Murphy to have a leading role for awhile now, and this was an absolutely stellar debut.

I did some reading on Oppenheimer while in high school, and Murphy managed to convey quite a bit of who Oppenheimer was; from the brilliance, to the ideological & political indecisiveness, to the womanizing etc.

Robert Downey Jr. was great as Lewis Strauss, and I’ll have to think about it for awhile, but maybe one of my favorite performances from him. Incredibly cunning and sinister, but also weirdly petty and paranoid.

This movie had an incredible, building sense of dread, but I think my favorite scene from the movie was when Oppenheimer was given the speech in the little, church like building, and the celebration progressively got more crazed and animalistic, and then the lone scream broke out. The whole sequence had a very uncanny, eerie atmosphere. Think this was great both as just a genuinely unsettling horror scene, and an insight into America’s gross indifference at the bombing.

The only one downside/critique I have would be the trinity test bombing. I know Nolan is fanatic of practical effects and filming everything in camera, but some smartly and minimally used CGI would have made the scene better I think. I’ve viewed some nuclear bomb footage, and unfortunately, at least for the time being, there’s no way to accurately depict it using only practical effects.

Overall, truly enjoyed this, more so than a lot of Nolan’s recent stuff. The runtime breezed by for me, cast was great and the score was amazing.",2023-07-24 16:53:55

- Florence Pugh was in like 6 scenes but was the standout. Making her death ambiguous, suicide or murder, with quick cuts was a great editing choice.
- Direction, Score and Cinematography are 10/10.
	- The trinity scene is heart palpitating and expertly direct by Christopher Nolan.
	- Ludwig Goransson using strings and classical music is phenomenal
	- Hoyte Van Hoytema with trinity scene and speech with the stomping was perfect 
- Writing wise, this is Nolan's best work. The non-linear structure with black and white scenes is a interesting narrative choice. 
- The set-ups in first 2 acts to deliver the twists in the 3rd act was honestly mind-blowing. I see why the script was likened to The Social Network.
- Supporting actors (David Krumholtz, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Olivia Thirbly, Alden Herenreich etc.) all had their moments. Jack Quaid with the tiny drums was a fan favorite!

"I really enjoyed the movie. The only thing I wanted to see more of was the actual science. The movie was about his life for the most part and the politics of the bomb but I feel very little was focused on the bomb itself. It barely explained why a hydrogen bomb was a much bigger deal than the atomic bomb having focused on it so much. It didn’t explain the differences between the Trinity bomb, fat man and little boy or even explain how many bombs they could make until they shipped the two actually used out of the facility. 

For having such focus on the setting up of the Los Alamos lab and the recruitment of the scientists it never explained what they were working on or figuring out. Why did it take 3 years and 2 billion dollars? Were they just waiting to have enough plutonium for 3 years? The only thing the movie showed as far as I can remember was them testing different ignition devices. Maybe it really wasn’t that exciting in reality. I don’t know. But I was expecting this movie to help me learn more about it.

 That scene where Einstein just emerged from the darkness on the lawn made me laugh. I thought it was ridiculous and he felt very shoehorned in to that moment. 

 Oppenheimer mentions the Bhagavad Gita while having sex and I thought “christ, here we go”, and then he said it, and my eyes nearly rolled out of my head.

"Saw it 4 hours ago, 

I am distinctly underwhelmed by it as a whole. 

Positives: 
i. Very well acted. Everyone in it played their roles exceptionally. 

ii. Some moments of it were genuinely captivating cinema, the Trinity Test being ""one of those"" all time cinema scenes. 

iii. It was very nice to leave a movie that was loaded with so much dialogue. 

iv. It absolutely does hold your attention 

v. Sets, clothing, locations etc are incredibly on point, fully immersive and at no point are you watching going ""this doesn't look right"". 

Negatives 
i. This movie is essentially about egos and moral dilemmas, but very little actual weight is given to either. However a lot of time is given to said egos and dilemmas. I really don't think any of it is fleshed out beyond a scene or two at the end. 

Honestly, after 3 hours of hating a few people, the pay off of seeing a man's ego shattered is not worth the 3 hours it took to have it done in in 3 minutes of scenes. 

ii. This movie wants you to know about the subject matter going in, which means it is really rather pleasant to not be spoonfed for once, however, and I appreciate this sounds like I'm impossible to please, if you do know about the subject matter, it's actually a bit enraging. 

He tried to kill someone, was a bit of a shithead, nothing is given to this other than 1 scene and a scene of him cheating on partners. Both of which are just brushed off in a few lines of dialogue. 

The actual Manhattan project beyond his role, the race against time, the reason it's used against Japan, Potsdam conference, the sheer technical accomplishment, the raging anti-semitism hidden as anti-communism of the era, the rise of the military industrial complex, any explanation of why the US/UK/West distrusts the USSR so much, that the bombs did indeed end WW2 without any allies soldier having to fight on the Japanese Mainland, the reason behind the red scare and a host of other things you might know about the era are blasted over in 1 remark or not at all. 

It leaves you feeling like you've either been left wanting  the film to explore those in more depth (not a huge amount, but some) or if you had no idea of the subject matter, I imagine a bit clueless about why he is being removed from his role of influence beyond he knew some university-student level communists who still developed the bomb when asked. 

iii. Character Arcs. The lack thereof. 
Honestly, only Matt Damon's Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr is allowed to have anything approaching character development. Everyone else seemingly has maybe 1 tweak in what they end up doing, rather than any change in them. I appreciate it's a mostly biographical movie, but it still requires some level of story telling in my opinion and it lacks something important for it. 
Honestly, at the end of it, it's very hard to rationalise that anyone had won their war, they had ended war as it was, yes they now had the ability to end all life, but major powers could not go on as they had which means no more world wars. You just don't care enough about anyone based on development to care about them. Yes it's a historical film which is absolutely up my alley, but it's still a film and needs to entertain and catch you more. 

iv. Pacing, or more so, dedicating too much time at points for very little pay off. 

Again, the issues around his hearing, without any context given just drag on, especially as most seemingly seem to be there, ultimately, to wrap up an Easter egg comment from earlier in the film. They wrap them up neatly and I enjoyed some of the call backs (aka, Oppenheimer is essentially an Einstein - aka the best of his era, but his era rapidly passed - but they take so long, with actors giving it their all to drag weak scenes to be captivating, but ultimately incredibly inessential in the context of things. 

v. If this is supposed to be somewhat of a biopic, or at least the telling of his story, Oppenheimer as a film gives you very little of the man himself. I feel like Nolan intentionally kept him an enigma to let the viewer put themselves in his place, but ultimately I feel the end product isn't the tale of an exceptional person, in the exact right place at the exact right time to book his place in history, rather instead leaves him appearing as an annoyed Project Manager who is unhappy and a bit of a dick. I just think he wanted the audience to make up their own mind (commendable) so much that he neglected to give them enough to make their mind up either way. 

vi. The soundtrack - brilliant in big scenes, weak af the rest of the time. It just makes you feel dread, but not a paced one, rather just 3 hours of being on edge whilst it goes on. The silence is used brilliantly, but it's made more impactful by the fact it's the only time in the film I felt like I was not being forced to stay engaged by the soundtrack, rather than what was on the screen. 

vii. Being a history bore, things were left out, but not wrong. The exception, IMO, is the portrayal of Truman was very harsh. He had arguably the hardest role in the world going on from FDR. Taking the oval office, in a war, from a man who kept the entire Manhattan Project from him, knowing he was playing out both the end of the European arena, needing to end the Asian arena and to set down a marker to his friend by convenience only in the USSR for the end of the war, knowing the iron curtain was coming, demobilisation of possibly the largest force in history all on an unelected presidency. To give him 1 line about how it was him who has to live with giving the order to kill 120k people, then leaving him as some slack jawed yokel with no compassion for the only other man who also shared a similar level of personal guilt felt like a kick in the jaw. 

In contrast to Oppenheimer's constant approval of FDR and the films little wink to JFK at the end left it feeling very hamfisted around the political side of things. 

God I wrote a lot there. Good, not great, feel it did have the bones of a great film but didn't meet it, which was a shame. Very low down the rewatchable scale for me as well.",2023-08-10 01:55:05
"I loved this movie. I won’t reiterate the thousands of reasons others have here, it’s all the same stuff. 

I do have one problem that’s a personal thing and wasn’t enough to take away from the overall spectacle of the movie, but was noticeable. 

In Nolan’s interviews he has a very well rehearsed line about why he doesn’t use CGI, describing it as “anodyne” or “a bit safe” or that “it’s difficult to convey threat”

I think unfortunately the trinity test scene seems to suffer from this philosophy a bit, personally I did not find the close up fireball shots to be as impactful to me as even watching the raw, real footage from the test. If there was one place to use CGI in the movie, I think this would have been it.",2023-07-21 13:19:46

"Beautifully shot, fantastic performances, and Nolan's direction just might be the best it's ever been. I have some relatively minor issues, but all in all, more than worth a watch, and if you're on the fence or thinking you'll wait for it to hit VOD, just go to your theather - it actually makes a difference.

I've always though Nolan's movies are needlessly convoluted and complicated almost just for the sake of it.  My favorite of his is probably Dunkirk, but even there, it feels like the non-linear narrative kind of unravels at a couple of points. In Oppenheimer, though? Not only does it work, but it works damn near perfectly. Funnily enough, I randomly felt the urge to rewatch The Social Neteork yesterday, and I can't help but feel like this is the same movie, but with nukes instead of Facebook. For a good chunk of its runtime, it's a very dialogue-rich movie that transcends everything Nolan has written before thanks to career-best performances from just about evertone involved.

Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic, and I'm so glad he's coming back to ""real"" acting. Murphy is a true revelation, and just plain excels in the portrayal of a very complicated, very conflicted figure. You know how people say there's character actors stuck in leading men's bodies? Murphy is the opposite of that, and he should absolutely get more leading roles after this. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are very underused, sadly, but that's just because the script doesn't give them a whole lot to work with. When they *are* on screen, though, they're as good as they've ever been.

And that last point sort of brings me to the only real issue I had with the movie. There's just so much stuff going on all the time. It feels like someone triee to condense Band of Brothers or Chernobyl into three hours. A new character is introduced every five minutes, only to come back again an hour and a half later or at the end of the movie. There's some pacing issues as well, with Nolan introducing a new little diversion on their way to the Bomb, but then that's resolved two minutes later, while the next issue they run into takes them 15 to get through. A lot of the comments I'm seeing here say they had issues with the last act, but it was the opposite for me: there were some parts leading up to Trinity that felt really messy and undercooked, but once the test was done and we got to Oppenheimer's ""kangaroo court"" and Strauss' confirmstion hearing, I was all in. It was a good twist for those unfamiliar with *that* part of Oppenheimer's life, and the stakes feel higher than they did during the building of an actual atomic bomb.",2023-07-21 22:22:40
"That ending though. Holy shit. Couldn’t have been wrapped up better. The anticipation to seeing what Oppy and Einstein were talking about, thinking it’s about Strauss, only to find out that it’s the true message of the film.

We are all fucked, and this was inevitable.",2023-07-22 02:02:22
The absolute second the bomb dropped someone’s iPhone alarm went off. For a moment I thought Nolan had memed everyone cause everyone in the theatre laughed.,2023-07-22 10:00:33

"So, I saw this movie on IMAX (I assume digital). And I went in blind, only seeing the trailer and was aware on surface who Oppenheimer was and it was the first Nolan film I've seen. But, I really liked the film and 3 hours went by breeze. Sometimes jumping from scene to scene was a bit meh, but otherwise I was really pleased and I liked it.",2023-07-23 16:23:53
The part with Truman was awesome,2023-07-24 04:10:04
"The build up around the middle of the film, from when they're discussing potential targets with the minister of war to the actual trinity test, was some of the most haunting cinema I've ever seen, despite knowing exactly what happens I was on the edge of my seat, palms sweaty with nerves. 

Best film I've seen in a while although I can completely understand why people wanted more Oppenheimer with their viewing of Oppenheimer.",2023-07-24 09:16:18
"When I first saw it, I thought the third act was great albeit a dramatic drop in intensity. But as I've reflected on the ending, I've realised it's about how the Western state apparatus chews you up and spits you out once you dissent, and that political actors care only for the assertion of their power regardless of consequence. Strauss was obsessed with a graph and what people thought of him, Oppenheimer was obsessed with his own hypocrisy in the adulation of creating a device that could destroy the world. The film actually doesn't work without it",2023-07-24 21:34:33
"I loved this movie. I understand some people frustrations with it though. 

It requires 110% of your attention. It’s 2 hours and 59 minutes of dialogue. The Nuke scene isn’t really the climax. I get how some people are let down by that. However it’s so much more than that. It’s a massively important story about American/World history and a character study of all the big players involved. 

The way the timelines all interplayed with one another I thought was masterful. Totally get how some view it as chaotic though. It’s not a Linear A to B, but if you keep attentive through the whole thing you will be rewarded when it all clicks. 

It’s a case of “a tremendous movie I can’t really recommend to most people”. I think you really have to be a fan of films and the art to like it, however I wouldn’t tell anyone not to see it because of that. Just understand this isn’t a typical WW2 movie nor is it a typical biopic. It’s done in the artists style.",2023-07-27 04:45:53

I didn't realize Gary Oldman was there. Dude is a chameleon. He just melt into this roles.,2023-07-30 03:52:57
"I thought it was a great film that really might take a few viewings to properly digest.  Overall I felt it was mostly about how science is hijacked by political agendas rather than about the moral position of Oppenheimer himself.  It shows how he was, really through his empathy (note the exchange with Truman) manipulated by cultural hegemony.  I don't think they mentioned Antonio Gramsci in the dialogue of the film (I wouldn't have the capacity to clock it honestly) but I came away thinking about this quote   
“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”   
― Antonio Gramsci, Antonio Gramsci: Prison Letters",2023-08-02 09:22:36
"I really like the distinction between Oppenheimer's motivation for 'going through the motions' of being discredited and Strauss' assumptions about his motivation.

Oppenheimer felt he had a reckoning coming, invariably, to the extent that even a kangaroo court repudiation still held some ethical validity. Strauss thought he only cared about being attached to the 'heroic' element of the Manhattan project, the purely anti-Nazi necessity of the Trinity test, and not the utter soullessness of a-bombing thousands of civilians. But 'succeeding' at framing himself heroically to the world/history is the last thing Oppenheimer would want.

Also really enjoyed the inversion of the pacing, where the classroom and political scenes are edited fast as fuck and you barely get a sense of the physical space before the scene's over. It only slows down during momentous conversations (meeting Groves, talking with Einstein, the Trinity test countdown, sex-as-fatalistic-debate, and the most significant testimonies in the farce trial.)

However, the ending didn't quite hit me because I couldn't figure out why Einstein would pretend to be nice/not hate Strauss until that conversation. It seemed like he basically just chilled out and tried to avoid being used as a pawn by politicians after fleeing Germany, so...why would he bother in any case? It was like the movie got so wrapped up in framing the ending with Strauss' self-centered thinking making him make a mistake that it forgot Einstein wouldn't have really cared to put on a nice face before that point, either.",2023-08-05 01:23:43
"I’m sure it was a combination of very well done makeup and sparing use of cgi possibly, but the aging and deaging was phenomenal. 

Young Cillian Murphy looked absolutely real, 99% of the time even when it’s well done I feel our brain can tell something is off. But with this movie it straight up looks like an actual young Cillian Murphy. 

And RDJ looking old was just perfect. Yeah he’s not a super young guy but the thinning hair and age spots again looked absolutely 100% real. You just could not tell there was any makeup or effects used, but they were. Idk if that’s enough to get best makeup but it’s pretty much the best I’ve ever seen. Especially with how detailed and close up Nolan likes to shoot, it was just crazy good",2023-08-07 12:21:18
"Awesome movie, watched it on IMAX today.

Only thing I don't get is, the part where Oppenheimer went to Leiden (Netherlands) to give a university talk in Dutch, he actually talked German?!

&#x200B;

And in some cases the intercutting breaks some of the tension (other cases it adds)",2023-07-28 00:02:09
Not perfect but deeply depressing primarily through its central narrative over the downey jar character who essentially was quite prepared to attempt to destroy Oppenheimer over some minor perceived slight even though he ended up destroying himself in the process and was still going down lashing out at anybody he could.

"Anyone else intrigued by the flip of color and B&W compared to most films? Here, it was surprising to me that Nolan used B&W for the more modern scenes, and color for the older ones. Was this to represent the world post-bomb? Or more practical in not wanting the bomb sequences to be in B&W?

Overall, liked the movie but agree with many commenters it was far from flawless. Also, I loved Benny Safdie in Good Time but found his accent a little cringe here.",2023-08-05 21:38:53

Feels like there’s a sizable amount of negativity around the fact that people think Nolan is putting on airs, but the movie and narrative comes neatly together, and getting flustered over imagery included for effect misses the forest for the trees. I think it was a beautifully told story. If it wasn’t for Nolan at the helm, those same people would be singing its praises.",2023-08-14 18:09:13

"Just watched the movie on Blu Ray so my initial impressions are:

1. This film is **packed** with information. It's back to back scenes of non-fluff dialogue from beginning to end. You really have to pay attention to understand what they're talking about. Anyone that says otherwise did not pay attention. Watching with subtitles is absolutely 100% required on first time watch. Second time maybe not but still feels necessary.

2. The cinematics, musical score, setting, production, and all technical aspects in this film are pretty close to flawless; though some of those earlier parts didn't need so much audible contrast. At least the dialogue was clear and understandable versus Tenet.

3. The story was pretty gripping, in my opinion. I can see why some people found the third act to be ""dragging"" but I found it to be a good conclusion on why Oppenheimer was being deposed in the first place. It framed his life and work for the plot.

4. As for the moral dilemmas - I'll save that for another time. For now I would say this is easily one of the best movies of 2023. The nature of the film doesn't really seem to justify watching in Imax though. Overall I'd give it a 9.5/10.",2023-11-11 04:20:46
"Maybe I'm not smart enough to get, but the Strauss plot just seemed unnecessary. I couldn't tell what Oppenheimer was thinking when half the time he is advocating for the bomb and the other half he is the voice of morality.

Mostly, it's just too long.",2024-03-29 21:04:22
"6pm showing in 70mm film. It’s top tier Nolan. Somehow extremely gripping with pure scenes of dialog which only he can do. If you go in expecting a lot of explosions, be forewarned this is like JFK and other courtroom dramas. Expertly done. 

But it. Is. LONG. At 2.5 hrs checking watch. And it feels it. No clapping at the end of my screening. I think general audiences will struggle with it. 

2 things:

1. If I hear Roger Robb ask another question, I will scream. Maybe that’s the point? 

2. And I want Einstein to pop up randomly in all future movies.

"The one thing I was a bit hazy on, in retrospect, was the impetus for Strauss' animosity toward Oppenheimer. 

I *think* the film was suggesting that Strauss initially wanted to ""collect"" Oppenheimer in his institute as a sort of feather in his own cap, but soured on Oppenheimer when he turned out to be an independent thinker (scientifically and politically.). Coupled with his own insecurity -- his insistence that Oppenheimer turned Einstein against him, and the isotope joke that really stuck with him -- I read it as an egotistical man who wanted Oppenheimer as an achievement but ended up viewing him as an opponent.

...but was it really that petty? And what was the context for the joke that clearly rubbed him so much the wrong way? I wasn't quite sure what the setting for that exchange was; looked like another hearing of sorts?",2023-07-23 14:30:07

I left satisfied that I had seen a solid Christopher Nolan movie and was surprised that I had highly enjoyed and remained engaged with a 3 hour biopic.  I was expecting it to drag a little; it did but still held my attention while it slowed down.

Here's a fun fact from LPOTL: During the Trinity test one of the scientists described the initial flash of light as an all-consuming brightness that overpowered him until he was screaming in his brain for it to stop. He said it felt like eternity--it was 2 seconds. I couldn't help but remember that during the many moments of extreme, unbearable music that went on \*just\* long enough, and would not be shocked to learn that it was a conscious choice to mimic that sensation.",2023-07-24 23:32:53

"Really great film. First time watching any film in IMAX and phew, great experience. Every actor did justice to their role, loved Rami Malek attacking Strauss.

"Here is the context of the “mermaid” quote from Dr. Rabi in the kangaroo court hearing, taken from the real-life transcript:

**MR. MARKS**: “Dr. Rabi, Mr. Robb asked you whether you had spoken to Chairman Strauss on behalf of Dr. Oppenheimer. Did you mean to suggest in your reply -- in your reply to him you said you did among other things -- did you mean to suggest that you had done that to Dr. Oppenheimer's instigation?”

**DR. RABI**: “No, I had no communication from Dr. Oppenheimer before these charges were filed, or since, except that I called him once to just say that I believed in him, with no further discussion. Another time I called on him and his attorney at the suggastion of Mr. Strauss. I never hid my opinion from Mr. Strauss that I thought that this whole proceeding was a most unfortunate one.”

**DR. EVANS**: “What was that?”

**DR. RABI**: “That the suspension of the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer was a very unfortunate thing and should not have been done. In other words, there he was; he is a consultant, and if you don't want to consult the guy, you don't consult him, period. Why you have to then proceed to suspend clearance and go through all this sort of thing, he is only there when called, and that is all there was to it. So it didn't seem to me the sort of thing that called for this kind of proceeding at all against a man who had accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has accomplished. There is a real positive record, the way I expressed it to a friend of mine. We have an A-bomb and a whole series of it, and we have a whole series of Super bombs and what more do you want, mermaids? This is just a tremendous achievement. If the end of that road is this kind of hearing, which can't help but be humiliating, I thought it was a pretty bad show. I still think so.”",2023-08-05 01:11:03

"Amazing movie, i mostly have one big issue and it's how mostly for the first hour it is loaded with fast paced dialogue, so many character introductions that when these names come up later in the final act you have to do these mental gymnastics focusing on who are they talking about, obviously it concerns only some of them, but still the movie does not let itself breathe for like half of its runtime. On the other hand i understand that they had to condense these events because if not there goes the 4 hour movie. Other than that i really enjoyed it, wasn't underwhelmed by the bomb test, lots of great scenes, performances and a powerful ending. And i think it was nice to see how Nolan pulled off this more of a personal, complex story especially after his last underwhelming (for his standard) conceptual attempt of Tenet",2023-12-23 01:18:01

"Saw it last night - no IMAX sadly :( Have to say I’m a little let down. I’m a massive Nolan fan but it felt too long with too many grey haired dudes whose names I couldn’t keep track of talking a lot. The moments where Nolan got to really flex his muscles when Oppy was trippin out were unbelievably intense and awesome. Bit disappointed by the explosion scene too - sorta was hoping for something more but not exactly sure what? Visually stunning, but an hour too long for the story it told",2023-07-27 01:51:58
"•	3 hours of almost pure dialogue and you don’t get bored. Fast-paced and intense.

•	Cilian nails the contorted/twisted and mysterious nature of Oppenheimer very well. Was difficult to get a read on him sometimes.

•	Damon was amazing, tbh he always is. It’s difficult to separate him as a person from him on the screen more than other actors but he was great. Thought he was very funny and produced laugh out loud moments, my favourites being his deadpan “right, build him a town” and “we will have him killed.”

•	Score was amazing but that’s almost to be expected now with Nolan films

•	Blunt has a habit of stealing the limelight whenever she’s in a scene. Best one was where she wasn’t falling for the interrogator’s bullshit and stood up for herself/Oppy.

•	Scene with Cilian shagging on the interrogation chair with the woman staring at Blunt was pretty shocking. Not seen something like that in a Nolan before.

•	Bomb scene emotions: WTF why is there no sound?! Goddamn this is eerie as hell. Holy shit, there’s the sound – I need new pants. Whole cinema was packed but completely silent for this which added to it. 

•	Nolan knows the importance of the movie ending and this last scene was one of the better ones. Puts Einstein in colour then Cilian drops the bombshell at the end.

•	Didn’t know much about Oppy so had no idea where the movie would go after Hiroshima but the Downey Jnr storyline/twist was very good.

•	Gary Oldman cameo was great

•	Random thing I learned, the experiment lecturer in the room next to Oppy at the start (Josh Hartnett) turned down Nolan’s offer of being Batman. 

•	Enjoyed the marbles filling up in the bowl imagery of the bomb being ready

•	Harrowing scene where he gave the speech after the bombs were dropped in the raucous crowd one of the best ones.",2023-07-27 10:06:59
"I loved a lot and disliked a lot

Pros: 
It was acted brilliantly. Cillian looking completely defeated as someone (can’t remember who) walked out of the interview room was great. 

the test’s buildup. The choice to delay the explosion 30 seconds was a brilliant one

The scenes with truman, the army deciding where to drop the bomb and cillian giving a speech were all magnificent.

cons

the test was really visually underwhelming. It looked like they’d blown up a little bit of dynamite not an atomic blast. should’ve gone CGI.

non linear nature of the film was hard to keep up with and i found it unnecessary 

Also found the political and security clearance element of the film to be a bit flat, not enough weight was put on oppenheimer not getting cleared for the audience to care. 

the Strauss storyline and his motivations were not made clear enough to the average viewer.

7/10 would recommend if you liked ww2 american politics and Nolan",2023-07-28 00:10:42

"This was the first movie I ever had to walk away and think about how I felt about it.

My immediate reaction was to wonder why there wasn't much shown or mentioned in terms of the Japanese people and what it did to them, but after sleeping on it it kind of all hit me.

Every significant character in this film is only viewing the events as they pertain to and affect themselves. Obviously this culminates with the mutually assured destruction motif of Strauss & Oppenheimer's careers going up in smoke. If anything had been added, such as an in memoriam, or some other nod to the dead it would have been vulgar. It would have seemed like insult to injury.

The only consideration is ""can we build this"" and ""can we beat the soviets"", never ""what does this do to the world?""

Even Oppenheimer believes in the false dichotomy - ""a peace the world has never seen...""

Again - it bothered me that something wasn't said but now I understand why it wasn't - because it just actually wasn't ever said or thought of at the time, and that's that the peace Oppenheimer is describing is not actually peace; it's Pax-Americana. Pax-Americana is not peace. It's managed peace under the threat of Imperialistic violence. The conditions for war are still there, but now there's a man with a big stick who won't let you fight it. That's not peace. No one says this because no one was even *thinking it at the time,* which is the entire point of the film. Everyone, including the US, sees themselves at the center, only viewing every event through the lens of how it affects *me personally,* and what *my place* in history will be. 

Other than that I just didn't get the tits, but great film!",2023-08-05 17:34:57
"From Hibakusha, 

My husband and two children were lost in the atomic bombing.
I am Shige Hiratsuka, who was exposed to the atomic bomb in Hiroshima.As a live witness to the misery and anger, I would like to speak out.My family consisted of my husband, myself and two children…, a family of four.
On August 6, Showa 20 (1945), just after 8 am, we had just finished breakfast. As my husband was reading the morning paper, and I was cleaning up the breakfast dishes, our two children played nearby.
Suddenly, what seemed like a streak of lightning lit the sky, followed by a thunderous noise. The house collapsed around us, and we were trapped.

As my husband and I were trying with all our might to escape, we heard, ""Help me! Help me!"" Our next door neighbor's wife was calling for help. I called out to her, ""As soon as we get free, we will come to help you!""

When we finally escaped from our fallen house, the first thing we saw was the total destruction of the city of Hiroshima. No houses or other buildings were visible. They had all disappeared. Fires were evident here and there. In my shock and fear, my only thought was escape. And, in my fear and rush to escape, I forgot the promise to help our neighbor's wife. My thoughts swirled around finding our children.

Where are our children?
As we called out our children's names, we heard, ""Help me, Mother! Help me, Mother!"", coming from a distance of about 2 or 3 meters away. I rushed in that direction. It was my own 6 year old daughter, Kazuko. I began calling for my husband who was at that time barely able to move. ""Come quickly!"" I screamed.
At that time my husband was bleeding from the shoulder and was badly injured. He was so weak that he was barely able to walk.
Our daughter was screaming out, ""Mother, my legs hurt, my legs hurt! My legs are trapped. Help me to get them free!""
I struggled to free her, but no matter how hard I pulled, her legs remained trapped. She was covered from the chest down by debris from the walls of the house and by dirt. It was impossible to free her.

As I continued to pull on her, the fires were fast approaching. I could see and hear and smell the fires. I was hot and unable to breathe, and could no longer continue my struggle. At that moment, I knew that if I stayed I would die. Dying was not a choice I was willing to make. I could not imagine being burned to death.

I said a prayer for my children.
""Kazu-chan, I am sorry. I am a bad mother. Please forgive me. Kazu-chan, I know you don't want to die, either, but your Mother does not have courage to face the fire. Kazu-chan, forgive me, forgive me!"" I said as I turned and walked toward the area that was free of fire. I took my husband's hand to help him escape with me, but as we moved away, our hearts were left behind with our daughter.

As we escaped, we didn't realize that we were stepping and falling over dead bodies. As I stumbled and fell on those bodies, I was not affected by a feeling of creepiness. I just felt a deep sadness. As we continued our escape, we realized that we had made it to the riverside of Yokokawa.",2023-08-12 03:36:06
"Got to see this in 70mm Imax and Jesus Christ it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I'd forgotten how great it is just to see close-ups of faces projected on the biggest screen possible. 

Some of the courtroom/hearing scenes looked as if they were filmed in the mid 70s. Absolutely gorgeous to look at.

And the sound was just unbelievable. I got a jolt through my entire body everytime an explosion went off. And to build up to Trinity and then drop us into complete silence gave me chills.

The scene afterwards where Oppenheimer tries to give a rousing speech and is haunted by Hiroshima was one of the most disturbing and powerful scenes I can remember. Truly like being in a nightmare, especially the way screams bled and bombs began bleeding into the soundtrack. Truly haunting.

I thought all the cast was great. Murphy's never been better, it was great to see Downey Jr given a meaty acting role for once, Damon has settled into the gruff old man phase of his career, Blunt really stole the last hour, and I loved all the brief cameos from big stars.

Only downsides: The first hour was a bit shapeless and dragged at times, Pugh was very good but her character felt like she needed one or two more scenes to really land, some of the dialogue is very heavy handed (they get away with it because it's so fast and often technical, but a lot of this film is verbal exposition). 

But they are small issues in an incredible 3 hour film that I could have easily sat and watched for another hour at least. Excellent, excellent film.",2023-08-12 10:27:37

"Oppenheimer made me want to go back to school to get a PhD in physics and write equations in my room for 4 years straight while Ludwig's soundtrack plays on repeat. 

Ludwig Goransson’s track played nearly the entire movie and had me sweating the entire time with its sheer intensity. His testosterone-fueled, aggressive tracks mixed traditional orchestra with synths while quieter orchestral motifs enhanced the emotional connections. Ludwig was so committed that he started writing 3 months before filming began and continued throughout production. In ""Can you hear the Music,"" Ludwig changes the tempo 21 times so drastically and aggressively that the track was deemed unplayable, the musicians in the full orchestra required a click played in their headphones before every tempo change, and it took 3 days until the entire song was finally recorded in one take. 

The editing matched Ludwig's level of intensity and focus. Nolan kept slamming scene after scene without giving us a second to breathe. This was phenomenal, focused, nonlinear editing. The entire movie was composed of thematic clusters of linked montages and vignettes which flowed naturally and felt like a dream. The brief cuts to particles vibrating, atoms splitting, bombs exploding, and stars collapsing were incredible visuals to complement the physics concepts discussed. The feverish pace was complemented by the music perfectly.",2023-08-21 19:44:16

"Writing just to get some thoughts out... I didn't like it. I think my expectations are partially to blame, to be fair. I thought this was going to be about Los Alamos  and the creation of the bomb. That ended up being a relatively small part of the movie (the only part I really enjoyed). I thought the editing in the beginning was really odd. It felt like one long transitional montage. The dialog was hard to hear. There was music playing THE ENTIRE MOVIE. I usually love Nolan movie scores, but this was just weird. There would be a scene with two people talking quietly in a room, and there's loud dramatic ominous tones playing the entire time over it. It was distracting and confusing. The drama of the communism accusations never really grabbed me. I think they did a good job of portraying a haunted man, but it wasn't riveting at any point for me. When you were expecting a dope atomic bomb movie and instead you get a weird artsy movie about a tormented guy for over 3 hours... I don't know. Pretty disappointed. I'm surprised it was so unanimously praised.",2023-12-10 16:04:25

"More I think about it the ""Can you hear the music, Robert?"" sequence might be my favorite scene in the whole film and one of my favorites in Nolan's filmography. It's Nolan going full tone-poem. Watching Oppenheimer study abroad inter-cut with shots from the quantum world, as this ethereal and dream-like score plays. Ludwig Göransson score during this montage is his best of the entire film. I love the tempo of the scene. The way it seems to pulsate as Oppenheimer shatters glasses in the corner of his room. It's such a moody scene. There's this kind of romanticism to it. The abstract portrait Oppenheimer stares at seemingly a reflection of himself.  It's somehow very much like Nolan yet almost completely different than any of the other scenes he's directed. I love it so much.",2023-07-23 20:28:00

"The real story and the viewers pov is that of Robert Downey Jrs.

I felt like the essential question of the film was determining whether Oppenheimer was truly against the development of nuclear bombs and the Hydrogen bomb because of their destructive capabilities. Or whether he was against it because he was jealous that he didn't come up with the idea for the hydrogen bomb.

The entire movie is moreso about the judgment of his character rather than his achievement. 

Did he really care to see the world burn? Or did he just want to see it done by his own hands?

That was what the movie was about imo. And we come to that essential question via the last couple scenes in the movie with Downey jr's character determining oppie's motivation and oppie's last scene with Einstein that Nolan made up.",2023-07-24 12:29:23

"Movie really didn't work for me, and that isn't a surprise as I couldn't finish tenet. 

The editing was frantic most of the time, and needlessly so. The story being told primarily out of chronological order was an odd choice given the type of story they are telling. It feels like at least an hour or more of the movie could have been removed without it having much impact. 

The confirmation of RDJ's character wasn't necessary and watching them put Oppenheimer on trial for keeping his security clearance didn't feel as climatic as it likely intended to. It also didn't need to be as remotely long as it was.

Choosing not to show any of the aftermath of the bomb drops was a bad choice in my opinion. Having them simply talked about in some throwaway lines really didn't do it justice. 

Also the only two performances that stood out were RDJ and Matt Damon. Not that anyone else was bad, just a bit one note. That seems especially true for Murphy, given how much praise he received I expected a bit more.

I think this could have been a great movie if Nolan stopped being Nolan a bit while filming it.",2023-07-25 14:05:54

Also, the only actual ""sex/penetration"" only lasts for like 5 seconds total.

I'm really surprised this movie has an R rating. It got an R rating solely for showing breasts??? I feel like in Europe with its more liberal stance towards sex and nudity, this movie easily could be rated PG.

"Watched the movie yesterday. Not a fan of Hollywood modern movies and pretty much watched it to spend a night away from home. Well, oun intended, i was blown away.

Perfectly written, with enough suspenceand clever placement of ""present"" and flashback scenes, since as someone who doesn't really know the whole story just the basics like project Manhattan or the Los Alamos, i found it gripping, wondering who is the good and who is the bad character. 

And this is what I loved the most. All characters are kinda on the bad side, even Oppenheimer. Most dialogue was important, no fillers, giving us a perspective of each one's motivation, way of thinking and the reason behind decisions made. The movie felt like a 90s/00s thriller, with fewer action, and the whole action was on the way the characters interacted. Of course the acting was really great and the visuals where on point. 

Bottom line i loved the movie, the way morality is a sidekick up until the end and the tension was obvious without having loud altercations between the characters, or over the top action. I will watch again soon and i will sure notice more interesting things and little details. Only downside was Einstein's appearance, which felt like he was some Balkan fisherman, and the scenes he was in, were not so interesting",2023-09-05 11:06:57

"Is it just me, but I felt like the focus of the movie was completely wrong? Like the personal quarrel of Strauss is a far far less interesting conflict than anything relating to the building of atomic bomb, yet the movie was exclusively focusing on it. I would have liked to see more of the science, more moral dilemma, more about how the bomb was built and what it took. The Strauss character and his beef with Oppenheimer felt like a C-story that Nolan focused far too much on. Would have liked to see more scenes with scientists and Teller. The movie had way too many supporting characters who only appear for a scene or two. The more abstract scenes and the internal struggle part fel more interesting than seeing the same board room meeting again. Nolan always had an exposition problem, but now he turned his entire movie into exposition and I don't feel like that solved anything.",2023-07-24 17:59:45

The intro scene with the Prometheus quote, and the finale were gripping, as well as the test scene. I thought the Sanskrit sex scene was silly, I also didn’t like the fast edits and cuts. It was faster paced than a typical Nolan film, but I understand why it had to be, otherwise it would’ve been five hours long.",2023-07-25 19:56:52
This is one of Nolan’s movies that I think was *hurt* by the non-linearity of the story. Felt forced in just because Nolan feels obligated to do so.,2023-08-07 16:14:20
"I don't get the importance of the sex scenes, tbh. Did it have any value to the plot at all?",2023-12-11 02:31:22
"Completely blown away by the movie. Avoided all the traps I thought it'd fall into, and went way further than I thought.

I recently went through both The Making of the Atomic Bomb, American Prometheus (and some Feynman books for good measure), and holy wow did they get so much right. So much dialogue is taken exactly out of actual quotes, and any artistic liberties / events shuffled around more or less still capture the history (e.g. it wasn't Kitty that refused to shake Teller's hand, but Robert Christy, at some other event). Even got Feynman and his friggin bongos. I almost feel like you're missing out if you haven't gotten more background with the books before going into the movie, like being to able to point out individual scientists and other characters and what role they played in making the bomb and the hearings.",2023-07-21 05:47:41

"Aside from a slight dip of momentum at perhaps the 70% mark (a bit after the test), the film felt overall well-paced. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Performances were excellent all-around. It was actually Matt Damon and Alden Ehrenreich that surprised the most. The former being so ubiquitous but he managed to quickly disappear into the role of Groves, an at times jocular but mostly no-b.s. personality that demonstrates managerial competence. The latter making the most of this post-Solo opportunity and selling the evolution of his alarmed understanding of Strauss's actual motivations.

Movie was also a relatively ""light"" R. The scenes with Jean are few and not that explicit. The scene with him reading the quote to her during intimacy is not as absurd as it sounded, mainly because he himself is apparently wondering ""is she really doing this?"" as it starts before cutting to the next scene. His imagined effects of the bomb were not very vividly shown either. That and an F-word iirc from Kitty and that's about it for rating purposes.

Finally, the bomb sequence was exquisitely presented but was treated as the mid-point of greater political machinations (and H-bombs) that came before and after. Looking forward to seeing it again.",2023-07-22 23:57:02

"Another absolute stunner from Christopher Nolan! The only annoying thing was the fact that some dialogues are so difficult to hear! I watched it yesterday and found certain parts challenging to comprehend - not just the discussions about neutrons and protons!

Sound effects and soundtrack were beautiful and amazing, but I always feel a bit slightly ""disregarded"" when I can't clearly hear the dialogue in a film. 

It's a masterpiece and a 9/10, but I just ask for clearer audio on dialogues on Nolan's movies hahah",2023-07-23 16:22:28

Does anyone have any thoughts on how Oppenheimer was brought down by his own countrymen after such an achievement. Felt to me as if Nolan was hammering home how the American government don't want there to be any real superstars out there and that at the end of the day the government are always the top dogs,2023-07-26 22:02:20
"I saw it in IMAX and was mostly able to make out the dialogue.

The one scene I couldn't get that I really wanted to was when Oppenheimer (and the more menschy Jewish guy, I think) met Heisenberg.

Did Heisenberg say or insinuate something sinister? It felt like he did (this being Germany shortly before the Nazi takeover) but I couldn't make it out.

I just got that Oppenheimer was homesick and wanted to go back to New Mexico.",2023-07-26 22:31:43

"The movie was gorgeous in 70mm IMAX but I'm pretty sure it gave me hearing loss. I finished it 4h ago and I'm still nursing a headache. Way too loud in my theater, and yet at the same time, half of the dialogue was unintelligible. For a lot of the movie I only got the ""vibe"" of the Oppenheimer hearings and scenes with Strauss, but hardly had any idea what they were actually talking about.

It also felt like a very Nolan film. The man really hates to tell a story in sequence. Most of the characters are exposition vessels. But the imagery, the depiction of anxiety, the scenes with Einstein, Oppenheimer's inner conflict are all very well rendered.",2023-08-02 22:33:14
"Lucky enough to live a short drive from one of the handful of places showing it in 70mm and managed to go yesterday morning. It was my first time seeing the film so I don't know how it actually compares to a standard showing, but when I think about other filmgoing experiences I've had, I really think seeing it in a massive format added something to the experience. At least for me. Yeah, it's a lot of people sitting around rooms talking, but I was completely taken in. It grabbed my attention long before Los Alamos and I was so thoroughly enthralled that by the time it ended I honestly wasn't expecting it to be over and was amazed that three hours had gone by. (The fact that the movie jumps around a lot and seemingly has a near-constant score probably helps keep the sense of momentum on this front) It's been a day and so much of it still sticks with me.",2023-08-03 01:18:16

One of the best films I've ever seen. Have watched it twice and can't wait to see it again on Bluray/digital.,2023-08-18 12:03:11
"So the good: top notch acting, great dialogue, and the themes of creating the bomb and the fallout after that also the complex character study of Oppenheimer himself.

The bad: Still sound mixing issues and dialogue was difficult to hear over the music at times, trinity test was massively underwhelming, I think I'm no longer a fan of Nolan's nonlinear stroy gimmick it was more frustrating to me than adding to the movie.

Overall I'd give it an 8/10",2023-09-10 13:29:40
"The ending not only leaves you with a profound sense of wonder at what the filmmakers achieved with the narrative and technical aspects, but also with a concern that the trauma Oppenheimer experienced in view of the impact of the work he pioneered can be much much worse with each passing day now that there thousands of nuclear weapons in existence.

&#x200B;

Apart from that, I think the really tragic thing in this movie was the way Einstein's predicition came to pass in the end.  And Murphy staring at the pond after his talk with him suggests that somehwere at the back of his mind, he always knew that what his colleague said was true. 

Never felt like going for a break while watching it, which for a 3-hour movie feels strange. Others might say that the film works despite majority of it being people sitting around in small rooms talking but I say I came here precisely for that. It was like watching a faithful adaptation of Asimov's *Foundation.* 

For me, a 9/10.",2023-11-17 21:38:19
"I've been meaning to post a comment on here for a while but damn what a movie...

Almost everything about it was great especially in the cinematography, music and acting departments the quality in those three aspects was off the charts.

I really liked that they took a more personal approach delving into Oppenheimer's life and the toll these events took on him and those around them it really put me in their shoes and allowed me to really understand their perspectives, it also made the actual bombings feel almost more impactful since simply just hearing about it would be how most people around the world learned of them.

As for criticisms/issues I have they are very few;  
\- I would've liked to see the characters a bit more fleshed out since I couldn't really connect with some of them.

\- I think towards the end there are a few points that felt a bit slow but even then I don't really take much of an issue with that since I completely understand why they were slower and couldn't have been paced any faster.

\- My biggest criticism is definitely the actual test explosion, or at least how it looked visually. I get Nolan isn't a huge fan of CGI but I feel like using it here would've made the scene better because the actual explosion felt kinda underwhelming and with it being part of one of the movie's most pivotal moments it sort of detracts from the movie a bit imo. Everything else about the test sequence scene(s) was great though

Those are basically all of my notable critiques.

Overall Oppenheimer is a damn fine piece of cinema and one of my favourite movies of the year! 9/10!",2023-12-07 00:17:29
"Saw this right after Barbie and it was just amazing. The scene after the bomb was dropped on hiroshima, when oppenheimer is succumb to the enormous guilt and thoughts of the lives taken by the bomb is just astounding.

"I hear everyone saying they were bored after the Trinity explosion, but some of the best acting in the film occured after that. Oppenheimer's life was very complex and he was extremely vilified after Trinity, so there was no real way to sugarcoat that entire aspect of his life. He pretty much spent his entire life after Trinity trying to absolve himself from what happened, so I'm not sure what people were expecting after the blast happened in the movie.",2023-07-21 20:12:50
"Can't stand how omnipresent the score is in this, as it is in most Nolan films I guess. It's a great score but man turn it down during some dialogue lmao",2023-07-22 13:03:26
"This movie is a testament to the importance of and artistry behind sound design.

I don’t think a scene in a drama has ever made me feel as disgusted as the people cheering and celebrating after learning a bomb they helped create murdered so so many innocent people. I’ve seen comments of people upset that the Japanese people affected by the atrocities weren’t featured, but I think it’s almost more powerful to show that the only way Oppenheimer was made to feel remorse was to imagine the impact he had in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on his own people. Oppenheimer never saw the direct consequences of his actions in Japan. To my knowledge he never even visited Hiroshima or Nagasaki. 

Also to see that would have been too much even for a movie like this. 

I do agree that there could have been a place in the movie for the local Hispano populations of New Mexico and the devastation the testing in Los Alamos caused.

Overall I was a huge fan of the cinematography (which felt especially refreshing for me after watching the recent Mission Impossible), visual effects, sound design, and soundtrack. 

The ending felt poignant and the movie was as horrifying and unsettling as a movie like this needs to be",2023-07-22 15:07:55

Simultaneously a cinematic masterpiece and a depressing introspection of mankind's propensity for destruction. I need a drink.,2023-07-22 22:01:45
"I'm always a little hesitant to contribute to huge movie threads like this one that already has 8K comments, but might as well add my two cents for posterity.

This film is an absolute technical masterpiece, but strangely I don't feel it quite lived up to the hype, at least the hype I had built up in my own mind. Nolan is obviously a master and made sure that everyone involved with his film is the absolute best at what they do. Along with the direction, it had fantastic acting from everyone (shout-out to Benny Safdie), Oscar-worthy cinematography from Hoyte, another great score from Ludwig, solid VFX, and almost perfect editing. 

Like many other modern movies, I felt it was a touch too long. The third act felt more like an epilogue and it started to drag when the kangaroo court and Strauss confirmation hearing was being wrapped up. If the run time was condensed to around 2:30 or even 2:40, I think it would've made a world of difference. 

I think Nolan did a great job of balancing who Oppenheimer was as a person with the significance of what he was called to do. I also really liked how he constantly kept asking the moral questions behind the Manhattan Project without lecturing the audience (at least until the very end, and even then only a bit). I personally would've liked to hear more of the science and the technical struggles that went on. As an analogue, I really liked the scenes in Hidden Figures and First Man when we saw about how challenges presented themselves and how the team overcame them.

Regardless of my mostly minor gripes, this movie delivered in almost every way and left me very satisfied.  I'd put this Nolan entry squarely in the middle of the pack of his oeuvre.   8/10",2023-07-22 22:51:54
GARY FUCKING OLDMAN,2023-07-23 18:26:06
I did NOT realize Harry Truman was played by Gary Oldman until checking the cast,2023-07-23 21:30:44
Well my Barbenheimer weekend is complete. And holy shit. Oppenheimer. I’ve never had a 3 hour movie fly by like that. The pacing and underscoring were incredible. Just so so good.,2023-07-23 22:22:33
"For such a long film with almost zero breathing room when it comes to a constant barrage of narrative information, I left the theatre baffled by how little information there is when it comes to character motivation.

Why did Teller turn on Oppenheimer when it was Oppenheimer who stood up for him in front of the other scientists, repeatedly? Why did Borden accept the role in producing that accusatory letter when he himself wasn't shown being involved with the whole affair previously (what's in it for him)? Is Strauss' motivation (and hence the whole third act) really just a result of that single radioisotope event? (Strauss even went as far as recruiting Oppenheimer initially, so clearly he admired him?)

This is all from just viewing the film itself. I'm sure you could get better understanding from actually reading up the history but — that defeats the point of a biopic, no?",2023-07-24 00:52:44
"This movie was just a little too long for me considering how ridiculously uncomfortable the IMAX theater seats were holy hell like leaning against metal the whole time.

Everything was awesome but I was a bit disappointed in the actual nuclear test. There were quite  a few scenes that looked very good but almost all the shots used looked like completely different blasts. There was a wide shot where it was clear it was a very small explosion and another where the fireball was really weird and skinny. I don't know the whole editing showcase of that scene felt really off and I personally think that CGI would have been a better alternative. It simply didn't look like the Trinity test at all and it's not like it would have been impossible to recreate considering the nature of that nuclear explosion.

Other than that and some really strange sex scenes it was awesome.",2023-07-25 00:53:36
"Did anyone not like it?   


I personally did not like the non-linear structure of the film.  The way that Nolan tried to spin Strauss's betrayal as suspense was lackluster and off-putting . Firstly, the structure really just made the trial lack build-up. Practically, the last ten minutes or so is where things unfold haphazardly. Almost trying to piece together a cop-out climactic surprise villain ending. Then 'thematic' suspense  is just off-putting for what it was trying to do, create a complex view of Oppenheimer. By the end, he was just doing Spielberg's school of Heroes vs Villain. Strauss, very bad man. Oppenheimer, complex but mostly good. Its too simplified for comfort. The use of time could have been more effective in showing the change that the film aims to show with Oppenheimer's view of the bomb to be honest. 

It had more success in telling the pre-trial Oppenheimer. I think its much more successful in creating the enigma of Oppenheimer. You could see him weak, uncompromising, a bit psychotic, and just a tad bit hypocritical. I felt that some portion can be edited down clearly, especially the Communist period or the pre-Alamo days, which was while important in the trial, does not really hold any weight once told verbally. It is what it is, people he had knew. The relationship between his wife and him could have been the better choice to focus on.  The three hours is not entirely necessary for the film to be honest.   


Otherwise, the  film is marvelous and well-crafted. I think Cillian, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Safdie were noteworthy in the film. The story could definitely had be tweaked. 3/5.",2023-07-25 06:13:39
"OVERALL SO GOOD!!

My fav parts:

* Score was fantastic and did an amazing job building up and creating the feeling of anxiety and dread that this movie succeeded at instilling me with
* The Lewis Strauss reveal

My least fav parts:

* Small nitpick but was Oppy his real-life nickname? Something about it throws me off so bad every time I hear it
* The Bhagavad Gita quote. This disappointed me because I didn't expect to be said while he was literally boinking, and only for the ""now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"". I was expecting the full excerpt to be said and done in a moment of reflection rather than a pseudo-serious sex scene. My naive brain thought they might've actually shown the real video but that probably wouldn't happen. Nonetheless, the Bhagavad Gita scene was a bit tasteless for my preference.

9/10 film for me! Maybe even 9.5! Maybe even 10!",2023-07-26 02:57:28
"After seeing it again im more frustrated with people saying it should have explored more of the impact on Japan and the people. This was an Oppenheimer biopic not a WW2 movie. 

The whole point was not the consequences of the nuclear bomb that went off in Japan but the consequences of nuclear bombs just existing. And I think they explored that perfectly. Incredible ending and it's still 5/5 for me.",2023-07-28 20:50:47

"Saw this last night and loved it. I'm neither a fan or hater of Nolan, but I do like his movies, so I knew I would at least like this one, but it really hit all the right buttons for me. I was honestly surprised at how much I loved it, I went in thinking ""okay, incredibly stacked cast but it's three hours long and from what I hear, lots of talking, I'm prepared to be impressed but bored"" and by the time it was over I was thinking ""that was incredible and I can't wait to watch it again."" I went on cheap night at my local theatre, it was packed, lots of weird energy, people fidgeting, being really loud for the first 15-20 minutes, but within a half hour the whole theatre was silent, and I didn't see one person walk out or even go to the washroom, on the way out everyone was talking about now much they loved it, just overhearing those conversations is one of the things I love about going to the movies, sharing those moments with strangers.  

Performances were all top notch, Cillian was incredible, shoe in for at least a best actor nomination (still too early to call that) and it was so nice to see Robert Downey Jr. doing interesting work again, not knocking the MCU, but it feels like he's been Iron Man for the last decade or so, and he really nailed his role. Benny Safdie was a nice surprise too, loved him in Good Time. Emily Blunt was really great too, no weak links in the cast in my opinion.  

Still wrapping my head around it all and reading reviews from more eloquent folks, and even some very valid criticism, any film that starts discussion is good in my books.",2023-08-10 02:00:52

Even though Strauss has personal vendetta against Oppenheimer, I believe it was tried to be portrayed as true when he says Oppenheimer would build the bomb without thinking again knowing everything, to be the most important man.

"Someone in my viewing giggled at the “stripes were embedded in their skin from their clothing” (I’m paraphrasing). I thought it was a disgusting thing to laugh at and makes me wish that they showed the after effects of the bombs in Japan. I’m glad they didn’t have a scene of the bombing itself, but it would be interesting to have more of the after effects shown to truly portray the horror of the bomb and to shut up those who laugh at it.",2023-07-23 13:09:59
Loved the movie. Please can someone explain why the last 3rd of film was important ie the trial- that wasnt a trial- to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance. Was it losing that security clearance really so terribly devastating to Oppenheimer ? More devastating than witnessing the horror he had unleashed? I really struggle to understand the directors intention. Did it give our emotions a bit of a pause before the anguish of the final scene with Einstein? So may lives ruined by Mcarthyism that Oppenheimer losing his clearance was not exceptional.,2023-07-23 16:22:08
"sorry if this has been discussed and I just missed it, but the part during the break in the security hearing where oppenheimer and Rabi are in the hall and Oppenheimer is eating the orange, what happened in the interaction with Ernest Lawrence? I didn’t understand that.",2023-07-23 16:54:50
What I'm learning is that Alden Ehrenreich thrives in 1950s period pieces about McCarthyism and the Red Scare.,2023-07-23 17:04:42

"I have to rewatch it. I enjoyed it but I feel like I missed a lot. The constant cutting back and forth between time periods, plethora of actors, accents, characters…it was really hard to follow for me. Plus, the dialogue was hard to hear sometimes. The background was so loud.

Good movie, though",2023-07-23 22:34:11

"I find it really interesting how Oppenheimer was probably inspired in his work by art, with the scene of the Picasso painting, probably under the desire that his work would be seen or compared to art.

Only to realise that throughout the film his work was used for destruction and death.",2023-07-24 07:23:55
"Rarely have I seen a movie where I’m still thinking about it incessantly the next day - the amount of research I’ve done on Oppenheimer, nuclear weapons, and the decision making surrounding dropping them. It’s crazy to think the bombs were built to drop on the Nazis, but Japan just held out longer. I’ve seen criticisms here about how the film rushed through scenes and didn’t provide enough exposition, but I love how Nolan had enough faith in his audience to not walk them through basic WW2 history and provide a detailed account on one of the most important events in history, the guy that made it happen, and the morality layers surrounding it. Both a beautiful cinematic experience and an important history lesson.",2023-07-24 13:49:33
"Overall, I thought the movie was excellent and powerful. The ending where it’s revealed what was said between Einstein and Oppenheimer was chilling. My nitpicks would be that I thought the film should have shown less of the Strauss hearings and more of the Manhattan Project. In a movie with so much dialogue, I’m surprised they didn’t show the demon core incident that occurred during the Manhattan Project. It was a frightening event that cost the lives of multiple scientists. 

I thought the sound design was excellent and most of the actors nailed their roles. The one other nitpick is the Trinity bomb test - I thought it was a little underwhelming. Hell, I even thought the bomb in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull looked better in some aspects. Even though there isn’t much footage of the original Trinity explosion, there is still so much other existing footage of nuclear tests preserved in great quality. In fact, there is excellent footage of the first Soviet nuclear explosion which was of a similar design and yield to the Trinity bomb. 

I appreciate they achieved the Trinity test without CGI, but maybe they could’ve touched it up with a little CGI and made it something special. Plus, I don’t remember seeing a shockwave, which is an identifiable part of a nuclear blast. In general, I thought there should’ve been more shots and angles of the test(maybe an aerial view). 

Anyway, I really liked the movie. It’s not an especially fun movie, but it’s an important movie that is still relevant to this very day. The threat of nuclear war has never gone away, so it’s something we still and will likely always live with. 

My Rating: 9/10",2023-07-24 21:20:53

"Saw it for a second time tonight, this time in 35mm at my local indie theater. First time I saw it was on xenon IMAX on a screen like 8 times larger, but vastly preferred the 35mm print. The colors, especially in the explosions, was so much more vibrant, and on the whole seemed sharper.

 It was pretty cool that the projectionist came down and introduced herself to everyone and talked a bit about how they had to modify the projection room to accept the 1 hour reels compared to the normal 20 minute reels they usually get, and the fun fact that we got the very last 35mm print made of the film!

Shout out to The Roxy in Missoula! Grateful to have a theater that's committed to keeping analog projectors going and training in-house projectionists.",2023-07-26 07:17:08

"Anyone else get a ""There Will Be Blood"" vibe from the Mahatten project scenes? That's why I'm kind of baffled at the complaints about this film. It's a specific type of movie that's been made before. It's unique to Nolans work sure but not cinema in general.",2023-07-27 15:15:05
"Some of the scenes like the speech in the auditorium, picking which cities to bomb, the Truman scene, they still make me feel like I'm about to be sick thinking back to them. 

I was familiar with Oppenheimer's life roughly to the extent the movie presents it, so nothing was a surprise, I have strong opinions regarding the subject matter, but the way the movie captures the gravity of the story had me reflect on it on a much deeper level.

Yes, there's bizarre technical and editing decisions, but overall I think everything works. Not sure if I can properly judge it yet. Maybe in about a couple of days, maybe never. If a movie's job is to make you feel things you haven't yet, it's done its job and maybe that's enough. 

Should not be seen on the same day as Barbie for anyone still wondering if they should honor the meme, both movies deserve to be seen on their own days. Bring earplugs to Oppenheimer just in case, the dialogue is way too harsh at times in IMAX (but The Batman and Dune weren't much better for me, so I'm giving Nolan a pass for once).",2023-07-27 15:55:34

"Can anyone explain they managed to have 2 more atomic bombs that they dropped on Japan made so soon after the Trinity test?

They made a point with bowls and marbles how hard and long of a process it is to get enough enriched uranium and plutonium to make a single bomb for Trinity test. They have been gathering materials for that one for years.

Mistake or did i miss something? Thanks.",2023-07-28 05:41:42
"I saw this movie last night (loved it) and I’m currently bed-bound with fever, nausea, fatigue and loss of appetite.

The obvious conclusion is that seeing this movie in IMAX has given me radiation sickness.

Nolan is a genius. Are there any lengths he won’t go to for cinematic immersion?",2023-07-28 18:25:20
"I was actually entranced with the movie for the most part and it was visually and emotionaly stimulating.

I think the first 1/3 of the movie had me trying to keep pace, it was a little overwhelming trying to keep track of the many characters we were bouncing to and fro, the timeline was a bit of a struggle but it got better at the end.

I think my lack of knowledge had me confused for specific aspects of the film. I didn't really know about the hydrogen bomb and the Robert Downey Jr trial aspect or couldn't keep up with it. This film definitely made me interested to read up more and the moral complications of the subject at hand was fascinating.",2023-07-31 15:18:45
"Walked out of the theater a few hours ago and can't stop thinking about it. My perspective may be a bit affected by having finished the book just last week. Overall, I thought it was an extraordinary capturing of an indescribably complicated, brilliant person. He was a mountain of contradictions -- loyal to a fault to his friends and devoted to his wife but chronically unfaithful, ethically driven yet morally ambivalent, passionate when advocating for anything or anyone but himself, expressing an intensely shy demeanor combined with remarkable charisma that inspired others, sophisticated in his thinking and then profoundly naive, sometimes downright inexplicable, in his actions.  There is only so much a movie can portray of such a remarkable life, even so, I believe it did an excellent job of not only showing the person, how context and politics and values informed decisions that were made, and the rapid evolution of physics during those times.

I will definitely see it again. I'm certain there is a lot I missed due to how deftly some of the critical moments were portrayed such as the one with Colonel Pash. I do think more could have been done with the personal aftermath of the security clearance hearings. I also think the focus on his off/on relationship with Jean Tatlock, while relevant to his alleged communist ties and his unfaithful nature, ultimately sacrificed too much screen time when we could have learned the same things and more by understanding his relationship with Kitty who also had strong communist ties and with whom he spent 27 years.",2023-08-03 00:44:38
Question- how did David hill know that it was Lewis Strauss who was reason behind oppie not getting his security clearance and how was his testimony enough for US senate to not to appoint him as the secretary of commerce?,2023-08-05 21:04:15
just watched the movie and...its alright. Not the best from Nolan and not one of the best movies made but it shows a decent view into Manhattan project and whole political view from Oppenheimer perspective. Now onto the subject where the movie lacked the most and what i expected to see... The bomb. Only once do we see the detonation of atomic bomb and it was during the experiment. The Hiroshima bomb detonation from someones perspective never happened and that is a big miss. Not even the plane view or public perspective. I'm not talking about something like terminator 2 nuclear apocalypse but something in that direction would have had more devastating effect on audience to actually see and realize the horror that happened. Its a movie and the fact that we only heard about it on radio and later on we see few perspectives from people celebrating to people puking from the effect of what the bomb did just did not feel enough in my opinion. From that point on it went into political views and to be real with you i didn't care much about it,2023-11-22 19:37:01
"I’m not really a fan of Nolan because of his sound design and editing, but if there was a film that the style worked it is this one. This is easily one of his top 3 films for me along with memento and the prestige.

Best picture winner over all the other nominees? I’m not sure. There were great performances throughout and the pacing and dialogue didn’t really suffer till the last hour after the clear climax being the trinity test and the bombs being dropped in Japan.

Great lines at the end- “maybe they were talking about something more important” and “I believe we did.”",2024-03-17 17:28:26
"Strauss' main motivation being revenge for Oppenheimer humiliating him made their whole conflict seem trivial.The humiliation should have been the final straw that pushed Strauss over the edge, not basically his whole motivation.

Oppenheimer's rejection of Judaism/marrying a gentile/Hinduism, his narcissism and self importance, awful conduct in his personal life, all these would have greatly enhanced his conflict with Strauss. 

They're were plenty of other ways Nolan could have taken it and he went for the weakest one.

Also that Kennedy, John F Kennedy line was corny as hell",2023-07-21 18:10:16

"It was decent. Certainly not the worst thing I've seen, but not terribly memorable to be honest. It felt like one of those generic biopic/WW2 thrillers we get every couple years, like The Imitation Game or The Darkest Hour. The Academy loves these movies.

I think it was a mistake to give so much screen time to the Strauss/hearing stuff, especially so early on. It just felt like it was weighing down what could have been a tight, sharp story about Oppenheimer's early life and the Manhattan Project. Maybe have one scene where we see his clearance has been revoked to make the point about how America chews up and spits out people to serve its own ends. It's a good point to make, but you don't need sooo many scenes about it. It just makes the movie feel flabby.

There's a really solid 40 mins or so right in the middle where the film gets focused and linear as they lead up to the trinity test. That's when the film is strongest. But the rest is edited so quickly that you don't get to know or care about any of these people, and the nonlinear editing just feels like a gimmick to make people think the movie is really dynamic and exciting. 

The score is great, but jesus it just keeps going! It just goes and goes and goes over every scene and every line of dialogue. That combined with the fast editing makes the whole movie feel like a long movie trailer. Every bit of tension in this movie is created by the music.

I don't know, I just didn't feel like I took anything special away from this movie. James Cameron scared the absolute fuck out of us with that nuke scene in Terminator 2, that still haunts my thoughts to this day. I didn't think this movie even came close to that kind of dread. So then what's the point? To highlight McCarthyism? I don't know.",2023-07-24 23:35:41
"Movie was great technically but I feel like the story didn't benefit from being told out of order at all. The whole Strauss plotline isn't really related to the main conflict of Oppenheimer's opposition to the further development of the hydrogen bomb and his antagonistic intention is some childish teenage vendetta, which undercuts the heavy subject matter.

Teller would've been a far better primary antagonist and there's no need to do the whole twist reveal at the end. Teller was portrayed to have always been interested in pushing the technology to its limits, and that he was opposed with Oppenheimer in their views.",2023-07-30 12:18:12
"I think this has to be in the top 3 for Nolan films for me.

For a 3 hour dialogue heavy film where the majority of the scenes are men in rooms just talking it did not feel like a slog whatsoever.

"Truly a masterpiece. Contrary to what some people say, I believe the film was quite fast-paced. A bit too fast-paced as I found it hard to keep up with things in the story. Everything came nicely together in the end though. 

The cast was absolutely perfect and I loved every performance. Cillian Murphy and RDJ deserve an Oscar nomination, their performances were masterful. Benny Safdie, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt also performed amazingly. 

The build-up to the Trinity test was LITERALLY BREATHTAKING and the nuke itself was also really well done. But the last two minutes impacted me the most. Seeing Oppenheimer’s vision of the future, and the fact that we are closer to nuclear war than ever before, just terrified me. And the way it was shot, together with Ludwig’s music and Cillian’s traumatized eyes made it even scarier. The film also serves as a warning for what could happen, let’s hope Oppenheimer’s vision won’t come true any time soon.",2023-08-15 18:30:07
"I didn't hate it, but parts of the movie felt like a montage and others like reading a transcript. Biopics fall into this trap of becoming life-action wikipedia pages and Oppenheimer did that a little, though not entirely. The trinity test was the ""docking scene"" of the film though and it was great seeing it in the theater. And most of it was actually audible! (Though during one scene someone in the theater did ask ""What did she say"" because Emily Blunt whispered something in her British accent.)

Also, it was cool to see Senator Pat Leahy (who cameod in almost every live-action Batman movie and was the longest-serving Democrat in the Senate when he retired earlier this year) get Special Thanks in the credits. I wonder if he helped with the Senate scenes.

Edit: Correction about Leahy.",2023-07-21 02:27:11
"Just watched it. SOme thoughts

3. I dont know the point of the movie. I dont think it added any value to film.

4. It was well made, as can be expected from Nolan. But it wasnt for me.

Edit: 24 hours later I reached this conclusion:

Nolan, and others, may have found Oppenheimer's story a very compelling one, but the movie maybe did not capture what he found so compelling. I am not able to figure out what his motivation for making this movie was. I feel the movie was straight-forward like Dunkirk and unlike other films like Inception or Tenet.

Jean especially was just funny to me. A minute talk, fuck, sanskrit dirty talk. She had 5 minutes of screen time and half of it had her breasts out.

I watched in a regular theatre. I don't think I would have survived the IMAX version.

Don't get me wrong, it was fantastic. I hope Oppenheimer wins multiple awards for both Sound and Visual FX, but I have never felt so attacked by a movie. Its not a feast for the senses, its a war.

I love the layered story telling aspect in theory: stacking the three eras on top of each other and cutting between them, letting them do cool things like the interview x sex scene where we see the POV shot from the sofa of Oppenheimer naked in his chair being straddled while answering questions but it did feel a bit jarring at first to be snapping between them, even with the B/W filter to distinguish Strauss' scenes

the Trinity detonation itself was a superb use of suspense as everyone holds thier breath to wait to enter the atomic age. I felt nolan did a fantastic job of showing the 'holy shit' factor of what an atomic test, never mind the first one would have been like to experience

"There were several places where I was actually thinking during the movie ""This would be better if there was silence in the background"". If the music is too much that it takes you out of the movie experience and you're actually thinking about the way the movie was made and audio of the movie - it's a problem. 

Loved the movie, but there were times like that where I was just taken out of the experience because of the music. It didn't add to it, it took away from it. I was expecting silence, but I got the music. Their dialog was minimized, the impact was minimized. Not everything needs to have a musical background. 

That's less about the movie and more of a Christopher Nolan movie making complaint. The movie itself was very excellent. I've read a lot in the past about the subject (I'm probably on some list somewhere...), and this movie was just the bees knees. Like a 3 hour long great book to movie. Loved the political stuff, loved the science stuff (even though it was minimal), loved the characters. 

My two complaints aren't about the story or the movie itself. It's the audio and the cast. It felt more like a Nolan ""I'm so big, I can get anyone I want in my movies"" BS big head thing instead of a ""these people are the best to play this role"". Many of those people didn't need to be there. They did well (I disagree with some that say Damon wasn't good playing Groves, I thought he did well). Just no reason for it to be THEM playing the role. Their expertise, their master skill, brought nothing to the role. Almost like making your star playing the tree in the school play. Just a waste of a resource. They did excellent in their roles, but the roles weren't there to really showcase what they can do. They were there only because he wanted it to be a ""filled with all the big names"" movie. That's what it felt like to me, anyway. He could have just had a lot of people come to him and ask to be in it, I don't know... 

The sex scene for the famous quote, though? Come on, Nolan. That was very weak and felt immature. Really minimized the impact of it all and any background context. I rolled my eyes at that scene.",2023-07-24 16:25:49

"I just watched it on IMAX (the regular one, not 70mm). I’ve heard some people complaining about the story being hard to follow and some dialogue being inaudible, so naturally I prepared myself a bit by reading stuff on wiki about Oppenheimer to familiarize myself.

For context, English is my second language, and currently I am in Taiwan, so the theatre only have Chinese (my third language) sub available. Mind you my English is better than my Chinese, so I decided to just watch it and pretend the sub is not there.

Anyways here is my take: This movie is a nightmare to follow if you are watching it without subtitle (This is partially my fault, should’ve expected it). I am ashamed to say I only know 1 person by their name. Strauss. I am excluding famous scientists like Bohr, Heisenberg, etc. For the others I just call them as Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, etc. I also made up some names, like the hydrogen guy. The combination of overlapping music, quick transitions, the sheer amount of characters, and the pacing are all just too overwhelming for me.

I will have to watch this again with subtitle in order to give a true rating, as for now it is 7/10 for me.",2023-07-27 21:14:24

"At first I was confused why they didn’t show either Hiroshima or Nagasaki. We get Oppenheimer’s terrible visions of destruction during his speech after only hearing Truman on the radio. But if you think about it, Oppenheimer wouldn’t have needed to see any footage of the bombings. He MADE the bombs, he already KNEW the second he heard about it the level of destruction it caused.",2023-08-03 02:37:15
"Now that I've seen it for myself I am desperate to know how the movie was shot, particularly how Oppenheimer's visualisations of physics were achieved in-camera. Has there been anything about this already?",2023-08-05 22:21:40

Just saw it for National Cinema Day and I was struck by the one-liners and comic relief. I couldn’t help think I would love to see a comedy directed by Nolan just to see what he would do,2023-08-28 17:03:20
"was reminiscing  hearing the ""can you hear the music"" track in the cinema for the first time, hope i never forget that memory.

2023 was special in film",2024-03-13 20:10:48
"Just back from seeing this. I thought I was going to love it; I'm a big fan of well-done historical realism, 'competence porn' is my favourite type of film, it was ticking all my cinema boxes.

But I left feeling underwhelmed. Given it was 3hrs long there was so much I wanted to have seen that they didn't cover. I surprisingly wasn't very invested in any of it. I was confused, particularly by all the time-jumping all over the place (I don't know why Nolan felt the need to tell the story that way).

But the weirdest thing was they didn't show them doing any of the 'brainy stuff'. All these scientists, the greatest minds of the day, doing things no one has ever done before, and they didn't show any of it. The Imitation Game was much better. Hidden Figures (though obviously tonally different) was better. When they all cheered after the Trinity test worked, it fell a bit flat because I had no idea how much work they'd put in because they didn't show it.

And I didn't have any sense of the war going on at the same time, and the drive to get the bomb made to end the war. Plus no sense of the discussions that must have happened when Hitler killed himself and Germany surrendered, before they finished it. That must have been a huge shift in momentum, but it was glossed over. 

It just felt like a 3hr film shouldn't need to gloss over huge issues like this. Honestly it felt like it even glossed over Oppenheimer's realisation of how bad the bomb was. The speech scene was really well done, but that was it. And the speech would have been right after the successful bombing; he wouldn't have known the effects it would have on people at that point? It's such a crucial part of the Oppenheimer story and yet I didn't get any sense of it... only his communist contacts and how they revoked his clearance. It felt a really odd place to put the focus of the film. 

And for a story that turned out to be more about Oppenheimer's career path than his scientific brilliance, what happened after he lost his clearance? Why was he given a medal in the end? When did he die? How did he feel about the arms race when he died? Not even a bit of text at the end to tell us this stuff?",2023-07-23 21:28:35
"I'll be honest I was a little disappointed, but honestly not suprized. The movie was less about the actual development of the A-bob and more about Oppenheimer defending himself against communist accusations. I would have been more intrigued if we saw more detailed of them coming up with how to build the thing over the years, but really it's a bunch of talking and next thing we know they are sealing up the gaget and it's ready to fire.",2023-07-21 04:14:16
"One scene that really struck me with its artistic choice was when they were asking Oppenheimer about his affair with Jean, and all of a sudden we see him sitting in the room naked. What a powerful visual for how he felt in that moment... His private life being put out there for all to see and judge him.",2023-07-28 16:14:33
"I loved it but I didn't really understand what was going on with the Strauss character. He's not in the timeline before the Trinity test and then afterwards is unhappy because Oppenheimer humiliated him in a hearing. Then does something complicated to cause Oppenheimer to be examined in that table hearing, then gets found out because another character we haven't seen much of reveals his plan in the black and white hearing but without providing evidence?

I don't understand what was going on with that. I got up to pee once and assume I must have missed something. I also had a few annoying people around me in the theater which took me out of the movie on occasion. Because I didn't understand that plot thread the last third of the film dragged for me. Can anyone explain what the hell was going on with the character? I know it was to establish whether Oppenheimer was a communist sympathizer and whether he should keep his clearance but who was Strauss, what exactly did he do to cause the hearings and what was the significance of the large black and white hearing where Strauss was being questioned?",2023-07-21 17:06:25
Did anyone else feel the non linear narrative was at times excessive and slightly jarring and detracted from what was essentially a good movie?,2023-07-22 09:28:11
"One thing that I really liked about 'Oppenheimer' that I think deserves more praise is the usage of the A-Bomb in the film. 

Entering into the movie, you'd think that you'd see a cinematic reliving of the Hiroshima or Nagisaki bombings and its effects on Japanese citizens. Naturally, doing so would help the audience realize the severity of the bombs creation. However, not for a split second of film was there any such thing. Sure, the bombings and the damage it had done were briefly mentioned, but never did we truly see the bomb actually being used. All we saw was the bomb go off during the Trinity test. 

It being a ""test"", which is means it is not at the expense of human life, creates a sense of assurance within the audience. The previous concerns with the bomb setting off a continuous reaction that could ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world are completely mitigated. As people in the current, where the bomb clearly did not lead to the end of the world, this concern carries deadweight for us. The movie also made sure to demonstrate all the safety precautions and preparations made for to the test. The culmination of all these factors were meant to create a bomb that the audience could characterize as safe, dare I say harmless. 

Then the bomb goes off. A shroom cloud of fire and smoke. Tremendous, and visually stunning. The delayed sound of the explosion, which whether anticipated or not, resonated through all in the theater. It was epic to say the least. And whether you stared in awe or fear, you were shocked, speechless, and completely stiff. I could not only hear, but feel the silence of the audience.

In the entirety of 'Oppenheimer' we only saw one bomb. This bomb did not level any buildings. This bomb did not destroy a city. This bomb did not take any human life. This bomb did not leave behind burnt bodies or the shadows of disintegrated humans. This bomb did not harm a single soul. And yet we all left the theater understanding the impact and catastrophic severity of this bombs creation.

That's just insane.

Everything else the movie did well others have already acknowledged. From the cast, to the soundtrack, to the visuals, etc. But one thing I felt needed more recognition was the usage of the bomb itself in the movie.",2023-07-23 06:14:57
"I personally found the movie very relatable as i, too, would throw it all away for Florence Pugh",2023-07-23 21:44:59
"Think quite a lot of people don't realise what a historical drama is, a good chunk of my viewing walked out, some well before the bomb scene. It certainly could do with some trimming, but the core concepts are done fantastically well",2023-07-24 23:10:55
"This movie was amazing in every way. As someone who works in STEM academia, it was wildly fascinating seeing the moral quandaries faced by Opps, young academics, physicists. It brought a tear to my eye actually. 

I only wish it focused more on moral questions he faced as Oppenheimer reminds me that history repeats itself. I think about Fritz Haber, the Jewish chemist who created a nitrogen chemical process to cure famine. Germany ended up being like, “hey he’s a genius, let’s ask him to create chlorine gas in WW1 to kill American enemies!” and he did. 

Fast forward to WW2 where Hitler ended up using Haber’s creation to kills millions of Jews in gas chambers. Haber’s wife ended up killing herself as a result. And he never forgave himself. 

These moral and ethical questions in science with government involvement is so fascinating to me because I think scientists (einstein, opps, haber, etc) fell victim to their own genius - how far can I go, how far can I discover, innovate. And by then, it’s too late.",2023-07-30 00:52:26
That ending is continuing to ring in my head a day after watching the movie.,2023-08-01 22:37:30
"Review by director [Oliver Stone](https://twitter.com/TheOliverStone/status/1686407445529116672?t=dqoeAq4fMR8W0pY9-VYBKQ&s=19):

>Saturday, I sat through 3 hours of Oppenheimer, gripped by Chris Nolan’s narrative. His screenplay is layered & fascinating. Familiar with the book by Kai Bird & Martin J. Sherwin, I once turned the project down because I couldn’t find my way to its essence. Nolan has found it.

>His direction is mind-boggling & eye-popping as he takes reams of incident and cycles it into an exciting torrent of action inside all the talk. Each actor is a surprise to me, **especially Cillian Murphy**, whose exaggerated eyes here feel normal playing a genius like Oppenheimer.


>Oppenheimer is a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate. Bravothe movie packs in the essence of the tragedy of Oppenheimer, a man historically in the middle of an impossible situation, though one, as Nolan shows, partly of his own making.",2023-08-01 23:45:12
Christopher Nolan finally learned how to deliver exposition without it sounding out of place and forced (mostly).  All the complicated conversations felt much more natural then many of the exchanges that happened in Tenet.,2023-08-05 02:09:37
"the pacing and frequency of cuts started to become confusing very quickly, especially cutting randomly between many different time periods. I think it would have benefitted from more simple nested framing. 

i.e.   Strauss hearing recounting the story of how he set up: \[ Oppenheimer's hearing recounting the story of \[Oppenheimer's life and the Manhattan project\]\]

&#x200B;

I though many good scenes were cut back to and from too rapidly which diminished them.  like many scenes with Oppie recruiting scientists, planning out the project, etc. 

&#x200B;

Also, I couldn't help but feel the Trinity test was underwhelming. I understand his desire to not use CGI, but maybe a little enhancement could have been helpful to showcase the world-changing scale of the bomb? as shown it didn't seem that much bigger than a conventional explosion.",2023-08-06 19:44:58
"Unlike it’s subject matter this film fizzled out. Way too bloated with filler material (the whole girlfriend/mistress dynamic is dull and drags the film). The explosion viewed in imax was spectacular though and is the films high point and climax. Everything else is anti climactic after this and the film loses steam, partly due to ‘thrill fatigue’ setting in. Movie tried too hard to be epic otherwise and just leaves something to be desired. But due to stellar effects and the gravity of the subject matter, this movie gets somewhat redeemed and I give it a 7.3/10. 

Overall, it seems over rated as fan boys gloss over some of the glaring weaknesses of the film. I suspect it will be nominated for many Oscars though",2023-08-07 04:28:22
"Saw it in 70mm IMAX and I thought that the build up and tension of the Trinity test, along with the gymnasium scene and the speech - that whole 20-30ish minutes was brilliant from a pacing and audio-visual perspective.

I can't help but think if the Einstein convo and end shot was right after that, how much more impactful that would have been.

The Strauss thing and the hearings ultimately felt a little too bloated, and I think the audience needs to shift themselves tonally into something more of a different genre, in the vein of a political thriller, for like an hour or something. To me, that was less compelling at that point in the movie.

Imagine holding on to the feeling of horror and existential dread and have it crescendo into the credits. Good movie, but there were definitely elements that dragged it.",2023-08-08 19:11:26
"Well, you definitely get your money's worth seeing it on $4 national cinema day lol. It does feel long. Don't really see the need to shell out the IMAX money for this one though. I didn't like Nolan's last two movies but this one was solid, so I guess I got one foot back on the nolan train. Murphy will probably get his oscar but I didnt really need to see his balls or know how Pugh was convinced to go nude for it, but anyway. It did feel almost like two movies between the first 2/3s and the whole hearing thing in the last act. Was a bit melodramatic considering it was all about... getting security clearance renewed?",2023-08-27 20:10:11
"Oppenheimer eats a fried egg sandwich. The music says, ""Oh my god, the pathos of life!"" Oppenheimer walks down a street, the music says, ""Behold the majesty of creation!"" Oppenheimer wipes his ass, the music says, ""Oh the sweet bitterness of love!""

I know all films have music intended to manipulate the viewers' emotions, but I couldn't handle this. Gave up after 40 mins.",2023-09-20 07:03:03
"Did every scene with Einstein happen in real life?

The one where he suddenly appeared out of nowhere behind the car in the middle of the night looks like something out of a comedy movie. It caught me off guard.

I can believe the other scenes, but that one? Really?",2023-07-21 14:47:25

"Three hours felt like 1:30. Very well directed, the premise was not so much to be amazed by the visuals, but rather understand the role each person played in this project. 

It felt like reading a book. 

Also RDJ did such a great job, I was amazed at his difference in acting along with his accent.",2023-07-21 21:20:32
"The movie was quite good but I can't say anything blew me away. Maybe I expected a bit stronger anti war message. I think the part that had to do with the bomb was greatly executed but the rest was just decent.

Feels like there was some weird editing with a tonne of jump cuts like I'm watching a music video, I guess thats the only way to make those endless hearings entertaining.

Talking about dialogues I feel like Nolan just doesn't write great dialogue, the lines just sound a bit robotic.

Movie could've been shortened by half an hour at least imo.

Id give it something like 7,5/10. With some more efficient editing it could've been a 8,5/10.",2023-07-21 22:52:51
"The silence as the bomb went off was an exceptional choice. 

Masterful movie all around. RDJ truly shines.",2023-07-21 23:52:45
"Just saw it in IMAX 15/70. My thoughts:

Positives:
- It's probably Christopher Nolan's best film, but not his most entertaining. I would say that's Inception. Objectively it's a great piece of film-making. 
- Cillian Murphy carries the whole thing and his performance is awesome. Some of his American accent sounded like Robin Williams, but that just might be me. 
- It's really well-edited and ""tight"" if that makes sense. Nicely paced. Some of panning shots of New Mexico were beautiful. 

Negatives:
- The relationship with Emily Blunt's character ""Kitty"" was a little half-baked. Here's this guy as a ""known"" womanizer as the film puts it and all of a sudden he decides to marry a woman he meets at a party for reasons unknown. And to top it off, she sticks with him through multiple affairs for again unknown reasons and even supports him. 
- The actual explosion was a big let down. A lot of marketing implied it was spectacular blah blah blah. Well, for being something so terrifying that carried through the entire film, it looked a fourth of July demo gone wrong. If you watch 4K slow motion videos of the actual Trinity test on YT, it's really scary. I didn't feel that in the movie. 
- It wasn't necessarily clear who some of the supporting scientists were or what they were working on specifically. Probably not relevant since the film is about Oppenheimer, but still some weird choices. Richard Feynman delegated to playing the bongos and nothing more... lol

Neither positive nor negative:
- The image went out 3 times for about 30 seconds to a minute. Super annoying. I'm guessing my theater used a Xenon projector and the current heat in CA caused it to shut off as a fail-safe.
- Sound design, Nolan strikes again with muffled dialogue. Some of the stuff I could barely understand what was being said. Although I never really had an issue with it in his prior films. 
- It looks great in 15/70 IMAX, but before seeing the film I thought I had to absolutely see it in 15/70. Leaving the film, I don't think it's necessary. You'll probably get the same experience in regular digital movie theater formatting. 

Overall a 8.7/10.",2023-07-22 02:31:04
"The movie was much funnier than I would've expected, the scene where Oppenheimer says ""birth control in not under my jurisdiction"" or something like that then the camera pans to his pregnant wife was hilarious",2023-07-22 05:37:23
"Few problems I had:

1. The pacing despite the 3 hour runtime feels very rushed. This isn't a film for the usual action audience of Nolan anyways, so he could've given certain scenes more time.

2. The explosion scene isn't as good visually as hyped, and the film doesn't need IMAX viewing as marketed. The soundtrack is incredible, so viewing it in any theatre with a good sound system will provide the optimum experience.

Otherwise it's definitely one of Nolan's best films. Acting is phenomenal. People should definitely go with some knowledge about the story, especially if you're not American. Some clowns sitting next to me didn't understand anything and were talking continuously.

Overall 8.5/10",2023-07-22 10:45:13
"I enjoyed it, but I didn’t think it was the momentous piece of filmmaking that some critics were hailing it as.

•The editing was great and made the 3 hour runtime fly by for the most part (the last 35 minutes dragged a bit).

•Great acting performances all around.

•Sound drowned out a significant chunk of dialogue.

•Explosion was a bit of a let down, and I know Nolan is a practical effects purist, but a little CGI would’ve definitely helped him out here.

The good certainly outweighs the bad though. The man took a 3 hour historical biopic with no action and turned it into a blockbuster. That’s a testament to his skills as a filmmaker.",2023-07-22 13:20:23
"I really appreciated how ballsy the film was. For one, it's a major blockbuster where the majority of the movie is people talking in rooms. Secondly, there was so much hype about the bomb and when it finally is detonated after an incredibly tense buildup, it's absolute silence. I found that to be really impactful. I also loved how ambiguous Oppenheimer's character is throughout the movie. I can see people hating that half the movie is dedicated to the ""trials"" but I felt that it was a great lens to explore the various contradictions of Oppenheimer, without ever providing an answer. The suspicions leveled by the govt are under unfair circumstances and they are fueled by manic McCarthyism but it was fascinating to imagine all the different motives he may have had, his communist agenda which is never really confirmed or denied (in history or in the film) and why he created the weapon in the first place then stood firmly opposed after the inevitable was realized. Also, the scene of him accepting his medal years in the future was profoundly sad. Loved it",2023-07-22 15:44:42
"Just when we thought we had reached armistice, Oppenheimer set off a chain reaction of guys buying fedoras because they think they’re as cool as cilian murphy",2023-07-22 19:23:34
Albert Einstein magically appears seemingly out of thin air no less than two times in this film.,2023-07-23 00:12:09
"The opening scene with the Prometheus anecdote sets up the whole point of this movie.  I went in thinking it would be a  historical epic on the Manhattan project,  using Oppenheimer's role as the driving force of the narrative.  It seems to be more devoted to the human experience of Oppenheimer, and the demons he carried with him publicly and privately.",2023-07-23 00:42:38
I’m gonna go out on a hill and say Emily Blunt should win Best Supporting Actress.,2023-07-23 01:20:55
"I'm glad I didn't see this in Imax because there's not much spectacle in this movie. Felt like 2/3 of this movie is Oppenheimer fighting the communist allegations.   


It's still a good movie, but it wasn't as horrifying or as visually awesome as I was hoping for.",2023-07-23 03:55:16
The final scene with Einstein. Holy shit. With Strauss ominously walking towards them in the background too.,2023-07-23 07:55:19
"So I did indeed see Barbie and Oppenheimer together and I'm just saying that there's a scene in oppenheimer where he's pouring his heart out about his guilt to Emily blunt and she's pretending to be sympathetic and then loses patience with him, that would literally fit in that scene in Barbie movie where the kens are pouring out their hearts to the Barbies. Physicist ken.


Also he literally had Jean Tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend. He loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things, people call him a dilletante, womanizer and insecure, neurotic.

There's even an early scene in the movie where he's pursuing Jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off.

Just saying the dude would have fit right in Kendom",2023-07-23 09:38:14
"Watched in IMAX, I feel like some of the dialogue was muffled? Like the actors were mumbling? Would have been nice to have subtitles. 

Anyone have this or was it just me? Most of the time it was fine just the odd few times.",2023-07-23 10:47:13
"So it was definitely better than tenet for me however time jumps weren't that great. The movie's pacing was unbalanced and uneven as hell. Probably I'm gonna get down voted because of this but the imitation game was a better WW2 genius races against Nazis movie to me. The characters felt more real and sincere. I felt more for them, I was fearful for them etc. 

The cast was great even though so many actors were kinda underused. Even cillian could've done more than this. Dialogue was okay (at least we could hear them lol) but I could not build the connection with the characters that well as everything kinda lost their importance after like 5 minutes 

Also the characters were quite one dimensional. Florence's character: she's a kommie and she hates flowers. That's about it. His brother a kommie and had a gf. His wife, well she had some husbands and she had some problems with him and their children but we are not that interested with these. Even the man himself wasn't that developed. Still this is miles better than whatever the tenet's characters were supposed to be. Still. 

Rdj was great. Matt Damon was fun. 

Sound design. For fuck sake man I'm a musician and I found myself in quite the loud places but nothing raped my ears as much as this movie did. Literally there are some scenes that the volume slider is like at 150 percent. And the explosion should be like this yeah absolutely but this happens throughout the movie and it's fucking deafening. The music was good the explosion was great. Showing the man's psychological struggle through music was also great. But come on chill out a bit. 

 That courtroom sex scene with Florence looking at Emily's eyes was weird and unnecessary as feck lol.

The last, old Oppenheimer make up looked kinda funky. 

Rami's character is getting: ""well I guess it's just a cameo"" to: ""well I see!"" was fun but meanwhile lots of other actors got kinda cameo-y roles while I was quite excited to see more from them. 


I feel like for now it's 7-7.5/10 but I will be rewatching it and maybe some stuff will get better the second time around.",2023-07-23 13:16:16
"This movie really highlighted my biggest qualm with Nolan which is if 90% of the movie is expositional dialogue why would you have the score so blaringly loud in the mix? I couldn't parce together half of what anybody was saying because the score overtook every voice. 

If you walked into this movie not knowing a thing about this story I would suspect you left not knowing much more. 

The most entertaining part to me was when it turned into a court room drama at the end and I could actually discern what people were saying. 

All in all, I'm pretty blown away with the reviews being so praiseful. I don't think this is even a top 3 Nolan movie.",2023-07-23 14:10:31

"I thought the sound mixing was supposed to be solid for this but I had such a hard time understanding dialogue for most of the movie.

Also was tough on a first watch when a lot of important dialogue was referring to characters off screen by their name, but there are so many characters it is hard to get straight who they are even talking about.",2023-07-23 23:45:48
It was impressive that they were able to fit the whole story into 3 hours. The Los Alomos Trinity Test storyline and Oppenheimer communism trial storyline felt like they could've been two entirely individual movies.,2023-07-24 01:27:18

And so recently my god. It’s incredible",2023-07-24 03:17:17
"Something I'm not seeing many people talk about is the sound design. The way the crowd's feet rumbling every time Oppenheimer begins to doubt the morality of what he's doing, long before we actually find out what that sound means, for it to transform into probably the most chilling scene of the movie was brilliant. It's the literal embodiment of a crowd of people cheering over the mass murder of the Japanese people

There are lots of fantastic sound design elements in the film but that motif was by far the most profound",2023-07-24 03:58:10
"I feel for Josh Peck, a man who may have signed up for this very small role specifically because he thought he would get to say Kenneth Bainbridge's famous line ""now we are all sons of bitches"" only to be denied the opportunity to deliver that baller sentence.

In all seriousness, this was amazing.",2023-07-24 06:30:27
I absolutely loved the Social Network stuff that happened in the 3rd act. IMO the real bomb scene was in that hearing room,2023-07-24 07:12:52
I loved the part where Oppenheimer has to say “*and* Nagasaki.” No one ever remembers Nagasaki.,2023-07-24 14:24:51
"This was a 3 hour movie that sailed along for one reason; the score. Without it, the movie would have felt longer and a chore to sit through. The music never stopped, it ebbed and flowed with the story beats and for the most part drove the story with its direction. It isn't overwhelming, it doesn't have any overbearing motifs like a score to Lord of the Rings or Star Wars - it is simply in the background driving the story. And its breathtaking.  
  
Then there's the sound design; the sound effects added to the movie. Specifically something comes to mind is the stomping of feet on bleachers that occurs repeatedly in soundbites through the film. We don't fully understand what the sound is until almost the very end (we learn that it is the crowd cheering for Oppenheimer after a successful test of the bomb), but its shown at odd moments throughout the film before that reveal - and it is open to interpretation. I interpret it to be the audio representation of Oppenheimer's moral dilemma and PTSD of creating a weapon of mass destruction. This simple sound bite expands the depth of Oppenheimers character in a way that dialogue or anything else simply can not. The sound of cheering and stomping bleachers to the idea of killing thousands of people and ""ending the world"" is seared into his brain and psyche - to come out at moments of dread.  
  
Never have I seen a movie incorporate sound in its storytelling better than this. Its a masterpiece.",2023-07-24 17:26:12
"The silent delay before the explosion scared the shit out of my theater. I also like how they didn’t ham up Oppenheimer as this big infallible hero and showed he was a person with flaws. 

I saw Barbie before this one and they’re both really good. I expect to see both films nominated for big awards this coming season.",2023-07-24 18:28:00

While I did like that they ended the movie with the Einstein conversation, the constant time jumps didn't really make it easier to follow the story and contributed to the whole thing feeling rushed.",2023-07-25 00:49:55
"Am I the only one that had a hard time hearing some critical dialogue because of the weird audio mix in this movie? It's nowhere near as bad as Tenet, but especially the scenes with music I couldn't make out wtf was being said.

I couldn't even hear THE THING that the whole movie was leading up to, what he said to Einstein.

The people next to me didn't know either. Maybe it was the IMAX mix, I don't know.

(Amazing movie otherwise, the sound design itself was phenomenal.)",2023-07-25 04:28:08
"When there is no CGI in a blockbuster, the end credits are crazy fast, turns out.",2023-07-25 05:00:45
"I was pleasantly surprised by the pacing, 3 hours actually felt like a reasonable length of time for this movie (and it so often isn't). 

Emily Blunt and RDJ were great and it was nice to see Matt Damon portray a soldier/military type who doesn't just say ""explain it in English"" to the scientists. 

The best part by far was the musical score, particularly re-using the feet stomping multiple times to build tension. I thought it was soldiers marching at first, but then it turned out to be the celebration after the successful test.",2023-07-26 05:35:07
"I really liked this movie, but was anyone else underwhelmed on the supposed big screen experience? They said see this on the biggest screen possible and I’m not really sure why after watching it. Fucking great movie though.",2023-07-26 12:09:52
"I think it would've been better if the events were shown in chronological order (except the last scene), I was a bit lost in time, or he could've at least flashed a year number at the start of the security clearance hearing and strauss hearing, but still a masterpiece, ending gave me chills",2023-07-26 18:47:07
"I really enjoyed this movie! I'm going to get a few downvotes for this, but it's not perfect, and I'm going to disagree that it's his Magnum Opus. Nor is this film a masterpiece. For me, Nolan's best films are a three-way tie between Inception, Insomnia, and The Prestige. With that said, here are my thoughts:

Pros: 

- I absolutely LOVE the acting in this film. My personal standouts were Cillian's subtle performance, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, RDJ and his conniving little ass as Strauss, and my personal two favourites from Benny Safdie and Josh Harnett! Quick little shoutout to Matthew Modine, who is great in general. 

- The visuals. I was lucky to see the film in 70mm, and it was breathtaking. I loved the raindrops and chain reactions, I loved the Trinity test explosion, I loved the way everything just looked so... beautiful, for my lack of a better word. 

- The Trinity test tension. This is some spectacular filmmaking here. Everyone in the theatre was at the edge of their seat. 

-  The soundtrack. I'm a big Ludwig fan, and while some think he's a copy of Zimmer in these Nolan films, I think there's a further hint of modernity and balance in his tracks. I found it quite well done. 


Cons: 

- Female character depth. No I'm not calling Nolan a sexist, he's had plenty of awesome female characters in the past. It was just this film for me. I found Florence Pugh's character really lacked in development. She's naked in 90% of her scenes, and it doesn't add to the story. Kitty Oppenheimer in real life WAS A CHARACTER. She was super interesting, and somehow the film managed to make her pretty boring. I loved Emily Blunt's performance talking back at Jason Clarke and being sharp as a tack in that scene. Yet, there's more to be desired when your two main female characters are ones where one is portrayed as a psychological mess who killed herself and was the other woman, and the other who was the protagonist's wife and portrayed as a messy drunk. These women were interesting DESPITE those things being part of who they were. A more honest and nuanced showing of this would've been better. 

- Narrative structure. This is a film where Nolan's nonlinear storytelling is unnecessary. It doesn't add anything to the film for the audience. I'd prefer the film to be chronological, as it's way more accessible to the audience. Especially in a biopic. You can still present the points of view, and Strauss' arc, I think can actually be strengthened by doing this. Part of the pacing issues here are largely to do with this. Time jumps without being specific about when they're happening aren't ""respecting your audience,"" to me, they're just annoying to piece together. 

- Odd cameos. While I love most of the cast, I actually dislike some of the cameos, they take away from the actual character they're meant to be. I didn't see Truman, I just saw Gary Oldman. While a talented, star-studded cast is one thing, ""oh look that's ____!"" takes away from being in the film. 

- The exposition. An unfortunate, tired Nolanism. Man, the writing is so damn good, but he forgets to show and not tell, and this time it was frustrating and quite distracting. 

Anyways, those are my thoughts, and while I was underwhelmed by some of it, I still enjoyed my time at the theatre, and I really have to commend a filmmaker who is still taking risks, putting passion into his projects and doing it in a BIG WAY. For that alone, Nolan gets my respect. 7.5-8/10.",2023-07-26 21:58:06
"Just saw it in 70mm IMAX and it was great. I noticed the aspect ratio kept changing between every scene but the film quality was great.

Also someone in my theater ripped a huge ass fart at the 1 second mark before the trinity explosion.",2023-07-27 01:06:19
"I was so immersed into the movie that when they were lifting and arming the bomb at the trinity test site, I was unnerved and uncomfortable. Being that close to something and knowing what it's capable of, it sent shivers down my spine. I can only imagine what it was like for the actual scientists that day.",2023-07-27 01:32:36
The complaints in this thread about not seeing the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on screen remind me a lot of the complaints First Man got about not showing the flag planting,2023-07-27 16:37:13
"What a quick three hours! Never wish I had captions more for a movie than this one with how quickly the dialogue and scenes cut time to time as well as the background sound being too loud at times sort of like Tenet. 

Gonna need some time to digest this one but really excited to rewatch this incredible movie once it comes out on digital. Highlights were definitely the bomb test and Oppenheimer's speech which made me feel so uneasy.",2023-07-28 01:37:58
"I thought it was good, but slightly disappointing. Pretty different from what I thought it was gonna be with the trailers since it focused so much on Strauss’ congressional hearing and Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing etc. and less on the actual Manhattan project. I don’t think Nolan does his best work with working on biographical/historical material. He tries to fit so much into three hours that it starts to lose focus. 7.5/10.",2023-07-28 06:30:18
Reading through the comments it seems many disagree but personally I thought the second half of the movie was much more intense than the first one save for the countdown sequence. Either way every minute captivated me and every actor pulled of a fantastic performance.,2023-07-29 01:19:21
[deleted],2023-07-29 22:37:20
"The issue for me was there was too much to cover. 

The movie was too broad.


I felt like I didn't also get a sense for the time period. Kind of wish there were just quiet scences not so much tempo 

Soo much happened that it was hard to reflect. 

I kinda wanted to be guided more.",2023-07-30 11:00:06
One of my favorite parts was when Einstein asked Oppenheimer who’s notes they were on the possibility of a chain reaction and when Oppenheimer said Teller Einstein just said “So thats where we are” lol Teller was really ahead of his time,2023-08-03 16:59:47
"NOLAN'S BACK, BABY",2023-08-04 04:04:58
"Just saw this in 70 mm IMAX. Its weird because the boom is a minor part of the movie, really. He probably should have either CGI’d it, commissioned 15 kilotons of tnt, or just asked the government if he could set off a small A-bomb. 

That being said, the imax experience and sound really made this into a thrilling, suspenseful, experience.

At the end, there was no clapping, no people getting up, just complete silence for a minute. I’ve never seen that before in a theater. I believe it was the contemplation of the magnitude of harnessing the power of atomic physics to create an unstoppable race to make weapons of mass destruction. 

I’m glad Nolan made this movie but I’m waiting for a updated version of Hiroshima, to really show what the destructive power of these weapons are.",2023-08-06 00:56:21
"Great acting, great score. The point of the b/w vs. color scenes was not clear to me. The explosion in total silence was brilliant, and I think the best scene was the speech after the test.

Shame about the accents though. All actors portraying non-native speakers of English seemed to gone for fantasy or ""generic foreigner"" accents. One could even have hired e.g. a Danish actor for playing Bohr etc.",2023-08-06 06:28:46
Nothing productive to add besides Einstein just strolling around in nature most of the movie and doing his own thing was so comical to me that I almost laughed when he showed up the last (timeline wise) time seemingly out of nowhere.,2023-08-06 17:32:48

"Christopher Nolan really did it again. I have not watched a lot of biopics that kept me interested 3 hours in, and this was one. Reminds me of Aviator.",2023-08-12 07:35:16
"I saw it in 70mm IMAX just now and it looked great, visually a very appealing movie. Overall a great movie with fantastic acting, though I felt the movie felt a bit oddly paced after the detonation scene. I also wished they talked or even showed more about how the bomb effected Japan. There was just one scene where they described what happened to the victims and it was fairly short, I feel that could have been explored more.",2023-08-14 02:21:06
"If anyone is waffling whether to see this in imax or not, DO IT, 110% worth it.

Imax tix were hard to come by around here, I had to resort to see an 8:15am movie.

This is a movie that makes you feel very small - this is not a criticism, but a testimony to the power of it.   I walked out stunned.",2023-08-14 19:39:24

"Saw it again this week, this time on imax 70 mm.

Mind blowing for sure but the most intense shot was the line of nuclear missiles being revealed in the last scene. Combined with the music, that was bone chilling.",2023-09-08 16:34:19
This movie was great until the end when they all looked like johnny knoxville in bad grandpa,2023-11-16 21:03:35
"I didn’t like it… and Nolan is slowly moving towards overrated with every film he does. Fantastic artist with great nuance for visual/sound design, but this and Tenet has moments where he goes too abstract with his direction. I celebrate his fearlessness, but fearlessness alone doesn’t always culminate into great artistry.

The development of the atomic bomb is one of the greatest marvels in science history, but Oppenheimer’s story isn’t what made the Atomic Bomb interesting; The stars aligning for the US to use it, and establish themselves as a global superpower is the more interesting story. The US bullying him was the most interesting element of the film, but this didn’t have the drama and urgency that warranted this story being told.",2023-11-23 04:20:17
Incredible film - one gripe I had was that it was a bit hard to capture all of the dialogue especially the Albert Einstein scenes. I'll rewatch this again with subtitle when it's available for rental.,2023-07-21 04:03:09

"What an absolutely INCREDIBLE movie.  One thing I took away from it, and specifically from our main character (Murphy btw...  jaw dropping acting) is how all JRO wanted to do was work and create from  his amazing talents with how he understood the world.   Like an artist who just needs to paint.  He and his mind were above the fray of the world.  Unfortunately the world dragged him down and ultimately consumed him.  An incredible opportunity that he could not pass up ultimately gave him heavy cancerous guilt.  One we cannot even imagine.   Nolan brilliantly keeps every single event including the trinity test just below the most important one.  JRO",2023-07-21 19:49:21
"Just got home from from seeing it. I appreciate the scale and the intention of what Nolan was trying to do (as ever) Murphy is superb throughout, and the explosion scene is one the more memorable cinema experiences in recent memory. Real on the edge of your seat stuff.

Not that I really disliked any thing about, but it suffers from trying to be too multifaceted for its own good. There's three, maybe four, really good movies you could expand upon throughout, but Nolan's trying to tell them all at once to the point that I was left reeling at times. It doesn't spend enough time with its characters to get the gravitas of the moments like the reveal of Strauss leaking the documents or Florence Pugh's death, and towards the end I was desperate for it to just slow down. Absolutely worth watching for its peaks and a must to see it in the cinema but it also reiterates the issues that are now recurring in Nolan's movies.",2023-07-21 23:00:05
"Wow. After the first 30 minutes the time flew by for me. Absolutely incredible. My theater was LOUD, and they used that silence in an incredible way. And that first scream when things go silent in the auditorium, i just had chills",2023-07-21 23:29:48

I had to walk home after this one. I couldn't do the Barbenheimer thing man I should have watched Barbie first. Cillian you are one amazing actor.

"I loved it. Loved everything about it, and cannot wait to see it again. I think there's going to be a few acting awards for RDJ, Cillian and Emily Blunt.",2023-07-22 15:41:47
"I'm just wanting to point out how incredibly effective Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack was. The trinity test and final interrogation between Oppy and Robb were so fucking tense thanks to his score (among incredible acting, directing, etc). To think he got his start on the TV show Community to producing Childish Gambino's albums to scoring this incredible soundtrack. He's easily one of the best and multi-talented individuals in music today",2023-07-22 18:39:16
"The film was good and the cast was incredible. Not a movie for everyone though. Having a really good understanding of who is being portrayed in the movie and a good grasp of the history of what happened will go a long way. You don't go to this movie to turn off your brain. I think its easy to overlook the scale and realness of how this changed the world forever because we have a lot of movies now days that aren't based in reality. This was the most powerful weapon ever built. The dilemma of making the choices that led to these events, what would happen if they didn't succeed first, dropping the bombs... makes you take a step back and see how this has impacted humanity",2023-07-22 20:03:24
"I went to see it in one of the only few theaters with a 70mm IMAX screen, only to be disappointed that I booked a 70mm viewing, not an IMAX 70mm viewing. Well, I watched it anyway. I agree with the comments that I would have rather seen a glorious CGI atomic explosion during the Trinity test, and not that fireball. I'm also puzzled by the 'Nolan' s best' reviews. I mean, it's a great movie. Not better than Inception. It's one of the best movies this year. Maybe the best movie this year? The complicated topic was handled quite well. But it was too political for most of the final hour. I was planning on rewatching it next month if I can find an open spot in the IMAX 70mm screen, but having seen it, I agree that it's not quite rewatchable. I did see that on a non-IMAX screen, the Trinity test scene was horribly cut off and felt very amputated.

To sum it up, Nolan might be the master of practical effects, but there are times when he should have used CGI, and the Trinity test was one of those moments.",2023-07-22 20:27:45
"Casting and all the performances are so good, everyone stole the screen time . Especially the ones that weren’t talked about prior to release.  David Klumholtz plays Isidor Rabi as the concerned “father figure” friend. Benny Safdie plays Edward Teller as the smart , easily bored and already moving on to the next big thing guy . The one scene with US secretary of war not wanting to bomb Kyoto because he vacationed there. Alden next to RDJ were some of the best scenes of the movie. 

As a lifelong fan of history of science, it was fun to see some of the greatest physicists of their time portrayed or mentioned casually like Szilard or Fermi.",2023-07-22 23:23:36
"Can someone explain to me how they took so long to get the plutonium and uranium for the Trinity Test and then seemingly instantly have enough for 2 more bombs for Japan?  
Maybe there was a bigger time-skip than i thought but it seemed so weird to me that they spend over an hour of the movie to make the bomb for the test and then like 10 minutes to make two more bombs (in another form factor too).",2023-07-23 01:05:28
"Absolutely brilliant movie. I loved the intricacy of the film and complex detailed stotyline. But in my opinion, the trial drama in the last bit of the movie went on far too long. It really felt like Christopher was just trying to meet a minimum time requirement. It felt like the trial lasted at least a third of the movie itself. Other than that, fantastic film. Worth my money!",2023-07-23 02:03:52
"For anyone that knew Fuchs was the spy going in, did you catch that any time they switched from the dinner scene to Los Alamos, they mentioned Fuchs immediately after. “Fuchs get your head down” was used twice after mentioning a spy in the Manhattan project.",2023-07-23 02:29:12

"Watching the Veritasium video is absolutely critical before watching the movie. Unless you have some knowledge about nuclear energy and weapons development, some events in the movie will appear random and disconnected (ex: a sequence depicting a huge black box in a basement, that happens to be the first man-made nuclear reactor, but the movie gives absolutely zero hints for the layman). Even for a nuclear geek the movie pace is simply excruciating.",2023-07-23 09:02:55
"I am on the fence on this movie

I think the performances were standout, and the technical filmmaking aspects like set design, costuming, crowd work, and visuals are all great

But, the delivery at times was quite… I won’t say confusing, but I will say jarring. It took perhaps a good hour to find its pacing - the first hour had to set up its two points of view, but having to go between two sets of character pov’s, flash forwards, flashbacks, etc it was a lot to take in

Some strange editing choices, especially during dialogue moments - not a lot of room to breathe in some instances. I noticed several times characters would talk and the camera would cut to them for no longer than half a second before cutting away - and some dialogue scenes during the first hour felt as though they had been trimmed down so much to bring the film runtime down. 

There is a lot to be gained from the film - the message is clear. I would say, anyone without some knowledge on the topics of Oppenheimer’s life and work could find this film a bit hard to follow…though I am glad Nolan didn’t dumb down the dialogue. No “English, please!” devices to get the audience informed on what was happening in a more surmised, simplistic fashion

Definitely a great film, but some flaws in my eyes",2023-07-23 10:33:46
I love the bit where Oppenheimer gets a “suiting up” sequence.,2023-07-23 12:37:15
"Rewatched it and it's still good. Once you have an idea exactly what is served, you have adjusted expectations which are somewhat met. You can also see the flaws better. The first half is too unfocused, it jumps from scene to scene and doesn't let you fully settle. Things settle when Damon comes in. Even though the trial at the end is important to Oppenheimer's story.. Strauss didn't deserve so much screentime. Second half is when movie magic happens. Third act goes hero-villain mode which could have been trimmed. 

Not a masterpiece. A decent watch still.",2023-07-23 12:48:32
"I thought it was brilliant. I was extremely hyped by the prospect of seeing this explosion on an IMAX screen but left feeling a bit grossed out in myself for being that shallow. Personally, I didn't want to see Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  I think that was kind of the point of the film... the spectacle drew me in, but the story leading up to and following Trinity really captured the life of Oppenheimer. 

Wouldn't have minded CGI for the bomb, though...",2023-07-23 21:08:27
"Saw this movie in 70 MM IMAX and Oppenheimer’s
head was a good 100 feet tall, he was big enough he could have eaten the greatest son of the atom bomb, Godzilla.",2023-07-23 21:55:46
Small thing I loved was when Strauss called himself a lowly shoe salesman late in the movie when in the earlier scene with Oppenheimer he doesn't use lowly when referring to having been a shoe salesman.,2023-07-23 23:02:53
"I love the way Nolan uses actors. Not many have the pull he has but using Oldman, Malek & Affleck in such minor but vital roles is ingenious. He doesn’t need to build up the importance of their character at all (wouldn’t have the time). We just automatically pay attention to them.",2023-07-23 23:54:04
"This movie is a near perfect representation of the book American Prometheus (which it was meant to be based on)

After thinking about this movie, I feel like there is a better 2 hour movie hidden in here.

I think the latter storyline could have been cut down to make a tighter film.

It's 3 hours of dude's in suits going at it over this. You'll love it if that's your thing. I know it's mine fr. The temporality it's a bit annoying because it keeps switching between 3 different moments and it's all over the place when it does. Perfect movie to take your dad.",2023-07-24 17:58:14

There were a lot of things I was hoping to see (>!CP-1!<, for instance).  I fear that a lot of people with no real idea about the specific history of the project would have a hard time following the story and recognizing certain aspects, especially given the pace.

The movie is doing quite well so far, so, credit to Nolan for making a tough subject so watchable.  My only recommendation for people going into it would be dig into the history.  It's some really neat stuff, and really pays off when watching the movie!",2023-07-24 18:19:58
"I just watched Oppenheimer yesterday and liked it pretty much. I know this is a movie illustrating these events in Oppenheimer's perspective and I know he felt remorse from it but what do you guys think the message was on the whole bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki? To me it kind of felt like it was taunting America's arrogance and calling out America's contradictory actions in the scenes where they were planning the bombings with all the military officials (the part where Henry Stimson says let's spare Kyoto because it has historical significance and he liked his honeymoon there) and the scene where Oppenheimer meets Truman. Although it is mentioned in the movie that nuking Japan did save more lives than if they were to not have nuked them.

I'm not saying I felt bad or uncomfortable because of this, I'm Korean after all and I think the bombings were necessary, but I just wanted to know what Americans felt about the movie. Was it portraying Japan as a total victim?",2023-07-24 20:26:16
"Plot question to help me clear up the time line:


Is the series of events in chronological order: >!Bomb testing completed and dropped on japan -> Strauss invites Oppenheimer to princeton -> Oppenheimer advocates for no nukes -> Oppenheimer humiliates Strauss at a conference-> The scene where Oppenheimer, Straus, and other officials discuss that Russia now has nuclear testing (the scene with the round table and the flower decoration in the center) -> Oppenheimer loses clearance -> Strauss is not confirmed to being a Cabinet member!<",2023-07-24 21:55:15
"Overall, decent film.  Some issues with the movie is that it felt too montage-y to me.  It jumped to a completely different scene every 30 seconds-minute or so in the first 1.5 of the film.  It felt overwhelming, I needed some parts to slow down so the film could just breathe and relax but I guess I get it as they're racing against time to create the bomb first?  The score was beautiful but there was too much of it and too loud especially over some parts of dialogue, like when Oppi and Jason Clarkes character.  It was funny because they were screaming at each other and I still couldn't hear them clearly because of the music.  Maybe it was just how the IMAX audio was mixed.",2023-07-25 14:11:54
"The movie gets better as it goes on, during the making of the test and gives better insight into what kind of situations Oppenheimer dealt with, while his team of scientists worked on the science of the project. I think that at times, it was difficult to grasp on certain decisions the characters made like Kitty not leaving her husband after facing humiliation in front of hearing committee, Oppenheimer still wanting to make bomb; knowing Nazis had stopped and that the bomb could start a nuclear weapons race among the countries. As the movie follows real life story of flawed and conflicted characters, at the same time, it only seemed only way possible to present the facts in the way they happened, without trying to provide logic into the decisions characters made.

The trinity test in the movie was really accurate, don’t know why people have been bashing that, just because they expected to be like the hydrogen bomb explosion. Although the movie was bloated beyond measure, it still managed to get all the details of his earlier, mid and life during the hearings encapsulated in 3hrs. It got confusing at times, due to shifts in Oppenheimer and Staruss’s perspectives being intertwined and exhausting near the end, but still, it was quite satisfactory. 7.5/10",2023-07-25 17:22:37

"Very powerful movie as it should’ve been, I feel like Nolan did a great job handling such a heavy and important moment in our history. It had its signature Nolan timeline bounces and personally I felt like it was a bit much at times, but other than that I thought it was great. Everyone’s performances were fantastic, any moment where Oppenheimer is experiencing a sort of out of body/anxiety riddled moment was completely unnerving and riveting. The complete silence during the testing explosion honestly filled me with a lot of emotion, really raw shit.",2023-07-26 00:34:42

Bohr (Branagh) returning was nice. I liked him knowing that he wasn’t needed and the team was plenty capable,2023-07-26 14:27:56
What is the significance of the Tolmans? I know Oppenheimer had an affair with her. Through research I learned she also worked for Bush and Groves. It seems to be an interesting story to develop but she got so little screen time.,2023-07-27 04:33:17

"Movie was aight, about what I expected. Might go again to rewatch. Nolan should try to adapt Slaughterhouse five tho. Nolan made the subject matter as entertaining as anyone could with the non-linear editing. I just think he is too creative to limit himself to a biopic. Felt like the whole ending with Straus didn’t have the impact it should have. Probably the best overall acting I’ve ever seen in a movie. Great editing. Score is questionable, felt like I heard those same synth noises from Tenet.",2023-07-28 04:28:20

"Nuclear weapon, the most cruel weapon used in a human history, was not just cruel; it is indescribable, unordinary form of massacre. Many took months til they die in unbelievable intense sufferings, there are still people who are still suffering TODAY from the lifelong lasting torturing effect. It was not instant. People do not know anything about how far more sufferings it has caused than just an instant kill. In Vietnam, people are still suffering from pesticides that have been causing birth defects TODAY. You should really visit Hiroshima's nuclear museum and see for yourself.

Hiding this movie from the Japanese audience is very coward and neglectful, avoiding critics from the Japanese audience.

It seems it is extremely insensible that the US makes this movie that could be taken as glorifying the use of the nuclear weapon. Making light of such events that have such profound and lasting impacts on individuals and communities can cause severe pain and offense to those who have connections to them. The producers obviously know this hiding this movie from Japan and still want to make this. No one has ever ""glorified"" the war in the past in such manner.

It seems it tries to depict its ""superiority"" by contrasting reproducing in infidelity v.s. killing humans, which were also very offensive. It feels being harassed, being forced to watch a sexual scene unexpectedly.

**No war can be justified, it is a massive mass brainwash and lies from dictatorships still happening around the world.**

US knew the Pearl Harbor and they invited Japan to China for a free railroad. UK brought Opium to colonize China.Who armed Japan with all the Western armors and clothes to begin with when there are indigenous Samurai and Kimonos with only swords. Do you think nothing pressured Japan to be colonized during 333 years of colonization of Asia by the Western countries. America deceived Japan into believing that America will protect Japan against the aggression of Britain when they received a fake permission to force open and militarize Japan, a closed country that never been to abroad. Politicians are assassinated if they oppose militarization. Russia forcing to draft the indigenous asian people to the war service today, US took over Russia in WWI. What is sponsoring Covid facility, ISIS, and all the “evil axis” in the back?

US ""create a reason"" to start a war even when there is NOTHING. US created Hollywood to make propaganda ""Battle of China"", ""International Military Tribunal for the Far East,"" which were ""fictional stories"" where Japan attacks China and use it as fake footages of the Nanjing massacre. US brainwashed China's Honghuzi and Kuo Ming Tang KMT to hate Japan, and used Azuma Shiro to falsely testify that Japan did a cruel act in China and spread it everywhere. US photoshopped the footages in China to overly exaggerate the incident to a significantly larger scale.

◆◆◆ Do US want to repeat the same WW2 Atrocities in the future?? ◆◆◆

People in the world don't know the enormous atrocities against Japan by the Allies ❢❢❢

Between 1944 and 1945, Allied forces massacred more than one million Japanese civilians with indiscriminate bombing, a clear violation of the laws of war. For example, the Great Tokyo Air Raid on March 10, 1945 killed more than 100,000 civilians and injured more than one million in a single day. In the same month, the cities of Osaka, Nagoya, and Kobe were hit by similar heavy air raids.From April to August 1945, thousands of civilians were also killed in violent airstrikes in Fukushima, Kanagawa, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Ibaraki, Kagoshima, Hamamatsu, Fukuoka, Shizuoka, Kure, Nagasaki, Okayama, Kumamoto, Takamatsu, Tokushima, Chiba, Kofu, Wakayama, Sendai, Utsunomiya, Iwate, Hokkaido, Chiba, Aomori, Niigata, Toyama and other local cities.

Finally, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, incinerating and blowing away hundreds of thousands of people in an instant. Not enough time to think was given between the 2 bombings. Hundreds of thousands of people who went to the rescue in Hiroshima and Nagasaki also died a few months after being exposed to radiation. Still other survivors also died of cancer and leukemia years later.

Even in the midst of these atomic bombings, thousands of Japanese civilians died in heavy U.S. airstrikes in Aichi, Fukuoka, Iwate, Yamaguchi, Saitama, Gunma, and Akita.",2023-10-20 08:10:17
Why does Nolan insist on using music for almost every scene?,2023-08-11 19:06:04
"I wish I could have watched this movie properly. My 70mm imax screening was a complete shitshow. Right from the beginning, the audio was de-synced from the video and would cut out for 10 seconds every 30 seconds into the movie.

Eventually they said they wouldn't be able to fix it for this showing and that they would be lucky to get it fixed for the evening show today and that they were cancelling the screening.

I'm getting a refund and will re-book a few weeks down the line when hopefully they'll have everything figured out, but it would have been nice to see this tonight.",2023-07-21 02:24:34
"What a fantastic movie. Cillian and crew killed it. It felt Memento-esque in a way with the story structure, and I loved that. I only wish I had a better grasp of the historical and political context to appreciate it even more. Some pretty good moral and ethical questions for the viewer to ponder too. Can’t wait to see it again!",2023-07-21 02:31:59
"A small detail I appreciated: they accurately depicted the speed of sound. I always hated movies where the flash of lightning and its thunder occurred concurrently. Especially with that classic cartoon lightning sound, you know which one I'm talking about",2023-07-21 22:49:39
"The gym scene was truly incredible, but the cheering and applause after the trinity test was absolutely haunting.",2023-07-21 23:02:51
"IMO, I feel quite conflicted about this film. I really liked how the story was sewn together but there were a couple of choices I didn’t quite understand. Mainly it was the sound. I wasn’t watching it at IMAX but at times the sound effects got so loud it got uncomfortable (the extremely loud stomping by the crowd in the basketball court for example). I was contemplating leaving the movie midway due to this. There was also a constant non-stop background music throughout the film. It was to build tension but I started getting fatigued by all the nonstop constant tension build up. The dialogue also felt very tamed and it made connection to the characters a little difficult especially by midway of the movie.",2023-07-22 02:36:32
"Great movie, I'll give it a 9/10

The cons:

*Pacing was too fast, all highlight no filler. Really didn't let some moments sink in. 

*Excessive soundtrack, I prefer movies where you let silence speak. The nuke scene was perfect to me for that reason.

* Makeup and hair wasn't doing it for me

The pluses:

*Cillian killed the role, really had you rooting for him.

*Not an RDJ fan, but he made it easy to hate his character. 

*Most of the ensemble cast knocked it out of the park.

*Source material is 10/10, and the interpretation was perfect. Loved all the historical namedrops.

*Compelling story that seamlessly wove a handful of threads.

*Cinematography 9/10.

*Felt short for a 3 hr movie.

One of Nolan's better works, curious to see who gets the Oscar Nods. Best picture? Cillian best actor? RDJ best Supporting? Loved it and would recommend to anyone who can enjoy a dialogue heavy film for 3 hours",2023-07-22 09:24:29
"Visceral, cerebral, emotive, and left me and everyone else who shuffled out of the theatre with in a daze with a sense of dread in the pits of our stomachs. This is Nolan's masterpiece. 

The whole film just feels like it's building and building to something massive and that's helped with the very quick, intense and masterful editing between 3 timelines (because of course it does, it's a Nolan movie...). I love how the score is just played throughout like 98% of the film. The music is just as much a character as Oppenheimer himself is and it sets the tone so clearly. It's a really beautiful score. The Cinematography and practical effects are amazing too and it was nice to actually see something that wasn't cgi for once, it's been so long! Along with the editing it's kind of like actor wack-o-mole throughout the runtime as new actors keep popping in out and of the movie each giving stunning performances even when they only have a few lines. One actor in particular who came near the end of the movie I think should be nominated for an Oscar and they were really on screen for maybe 2 minutes? Shout out to Josh Harnett too, glad to see him back and killing it. 

Cillian Murphy is the real star here and fantastic in the title role and I think deserves recognition for his part. This is not just a movie about the man who man the atom bomb, but also about the guilt the comes there after. Murphy effortlessly glides through the timelines in this movie and makes each new iteration of Oppenheimer feel different & nuanced but the same. It's subtle but really hard to achieve I think. 

The final hour for sure drags ever so slightly after the middle climatic scene, but the movie won me back in the end. And it's there to really showcase that feeling of guilt that so prevalent to the thesis of the film. The biggest flaw is how Nolan still writes women but there is a v memorable and gnarly scene involving Pugh and Blunt that I felt was powerful and kind of bad ass for Nolan to do, didn't know he had it in em. 

It's probably one of the most well-crafted bio flicks I've ever seen and one that'll be in my mind for a long time. The power, money, and influence that went into the creation of the most devastating weapons in mankind and the deaths that resulted from it is horrifying. I really want to give grave of the fireflies a rewatch to see this all from the Japanese perspective. Would be a great double feature I think. 

Let's enjoy this great time to be a movie lover.

"I missed out on the trinity test cuz I almost shit my pants. I was trying to hold it in but I started getting the bubble guts. Thank God for Dolby Digital bass drowning it out, but I felt like as the score got more intense so did the feeling of almost shitting my pants. Once Josh Peck put the key in I had to run from the middle of the aisle to the bathroom. I dropped my own bomb, and got back in my seat right as Benny Safdie was smiling at the sky. I have to go back and watch it again but everything else I saw was amazing",2023-07-24 01:01:03
"I thought this movie was good. I liked it. This is gonna sound paradoxical but I felt the overall film was too fast and too slow at the same time. Many other people feel the same as me that there were just too many characters, with so much dialogue and such a short introduction. Then there was the transition between black and white and colour. This could've been easily explained but instead we just saw 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. I loved the development of the bomb, testing etc. I know there's gonna be people who say this film is a masterpiece and that's fine, each to their own. Just don't come at me for saying I didn't enjoy it.",2023-07-24 04:02:06
"The scene of him addressing the crowd was enthralling, this was one conflicted individual. A deeply conflicted Oppenheimer worrying about Japan underneath but then outwardly finishing off his speech with ""if only we could've done it to the Germans!"" or something like that was just moving af.

I would've liked to have seen some coverage of his early life growing up in the upper west side in a German Jewish family. This was not your typical early 20th century American Jewish upbringing like that of Isi Rabi's was. There was a quick reference to that between the two early in the movie, and only a brief mention of his father, but Robert's childhood would've influenced the man he ultimately becomes quite a bit and it's a bit disappointing that Nolan didn't explore a young Robert at all. Overall i liked it tho, 9/10.",2023-07-24 05:34:47
"Call me dense, but I didn't really get the point or message of the movie.

Was it about the horrors of a nuclear bomb? Didn't really deliver that home for me.

Was it about Oppenheimer's life? It jumped around so much, and every scene felt like little snippets/anecdotes of his life that I really didn't connect with him at any level. Just seems like a brilliant scientist with a shitty personal life.

I think the most effective message it delivered to me was how dumb McCarthyism got and the paranoia that was prevalent in the 50s",2023-07-24 09:01:44
"All i could think about was how intense the postproduction must have been. 

There was music playing for probably about 2 hours and 45 minutes of the 3 hours. And it was cut quicker than any other movie I’d ever seen. Felt like each scene was only 2-3 minutes in a 3 fucking hour movie. A script like that is a ridiculous achievement. 

It felt like the only time i could breath was when the trial bomb went off",2023-07-26 14:14:26

"The countdown to the explosion and the explosion itself was an incredible experience. Everyone knew what's gonna happen, yet everyone seemed totally invested in it. My heart was pounding. No thriller ever gave me as much thrill as this movie did with its soundtrack and presentation. I also think it was generally very mature and on point. Somehow made a fast-paced 3-hour movie that I wished would go on for longer. Brilliant.",2023-07-28 21:00:13
"I loved it. Especially how breakneck the pace was. I've never seen a biopic that felt like such an action suspense thriller.

"I loved the pacing of the movie until the trials.
They felt a little dragged out.

But the atmosphere was something else. It was so intense waiting for the bomb tests etc.

We literally sat there holding our ears when waiting for the trinity test lol.
It’s one of the movies that I will never watch again at home, because it relied so heavily on the audio experience and will never work at home. Also the music was great.",2023-08-09 09:32:19
"I'm really hesitant to watch this in the movie theater as Interstellar and Tenet were really hard for me to watch because of the sound.

It's insanely frustrating for me to know there is important dialog that I can't hear because of the loud music or just the audio volume is really low.

If it's bad, I will wait till it's out in some form of streaming service with subtitles instead of being annoyed for 3 hours in the theater.",2023-08-11 18:14:26
"Just finished a second watching. Did anyone else notice all the pianos? I don’t mean in the score, like in the actual movie. I counted five:

in his classroom in Berkeley

in the house where the communist party meeting was when he meets Jean

in one of the meeting rooms in Los Alamos

in the room where Dr Hill tries to get Oppenheimer to sign the petition before he meets the War Secretary) in Washington

in his house at the end, when Kitty is trying to get him to fight back against the hearing

What’s it all about? I’m sure at the time it was common (as it still is) to have a piano in the house, but the other ones are kind of odd. Apparently Oppenheimer didn’t like music much either so it’s all a bit weird. Any theories?",2023-08-16 19:29:16
"I watched it yesterday and i found that the Storyline with the interrogation was drawn out a bit too much, especially at the end but other than that i thought it was a pretty great movie. The editing was pretty genius, and they gave a neat portrayal of Oppenheimer, in so far that you get a good Idea of the Kind of Person that He was.",2023-08-26 07:43:12
"Finally got to see it last night, we loved it and were knocked back on our heels by it for a good long while afterwards.

One thing we agreed is we’d love to see a Kitty Oppenheimer movie. Fascinating individual as portrayed.",2023-09-03 14:43:23
"It really didn't do anything for me. I think you had to already have known his story very well. All the politics etc.
I didnt. All I knew was that he was a brilliant physicist who led the team that developed the bomb.
For me it just would have been better if it ended when they dropped the bombs.
All the after it politics? Not interested. 
Actually? I dont think i ever made it to the end.

The first half of it was decent....then it just chopped & changed & went on and on and on for what to me was no great reason?!? I still cant work out why the Pollie played by Robert Downey Jnr hated him so much and when he went from offering. Oppenheimer a great job to hating his guts??!!",2024-02-29 07:36:47
"Great movie - made a list of things I loved about it.
1. Extensive dialogue scenes - You feel like you are in the room with the actors. Wonderful for history buffs who really want to delve deep into the context of all these amazing figures.
2. Cut scenes. Added a layer of complexity to the movie. Kind of like you had to solve a puzzle with how convoluted some of these were.
3. Little action. It's refreshing that this movie didn't have much action or over the top moments. It's not an action movie at the end of the day, it's a drama.
4. Excellent for falling asleep. A lot of people are calling this movie boring but I think it has a lot of rewatchability if you are having trouble falling asleep at 2am in the morning.",2023-07-21 13:16:20

"The delayed sound of the bomb and the delayed sounds of the crowds cheers being used as a way to represent the delayed consequences of the creation of this technology… 

The crowds stomps being used as a horror theme to score the scenes earlier in the movie and build the tension as we barrel toward this inevitable ending. 

Just a masterclass from Nolan.",2023-08-06 22:54:21
"I felt like the conflict with Strauss was not as engaging as the movie wanted it to be. Strauss's character was supposedly petty and evil, but we weren't really allowed to see that pettiness until it was revealed in a clumsy, in your face way (IT WAS STRAUSS ALL ALONG...uhhh okay what)...and the whole interrogation to remove Oppie's security clearance took too long. I felt like the movie lagged a bit toward the end. I enjoyed the scene with Truman and I would have liked to feel more of the blowback toward Oppie from the whole political apparatus prior to the removal of his clearance. This movie didn't feel very balanced. Also yeah as another commenter said, I needed more Pugh, and I am curious about whether the real life Jean's alleged homosexuality was in the book because I think her character was oversimplified here, and I would have loved to see a more complex portrayal. Overall I enjoyed it, it's hard not to enjoy that streak of genius that is in all of Nolan's work, but I was slightly disappointed.

Edit: I'll also add that the Oppie pro atom bomb speech was powerful but this movie deserved more of a vision of Hiroshima. Follow one person who was bombed and died in the following days.",2023-08-12 15:42:56
"I saw this in fake IMAX a couple days ago but it filled the whole screen so probably like 16:9 which is nice. We don't have a real IMAX where I live and the closest one is more than 14 hours drive away. I don't think I can watch this movie in 2.35:1 scope. Scope is such a horrible format. This movie looked incredible filling up the whole screen.

As to the actual contents of the film. I've been thinking about this movie damn near constantly since I saw it. It's just been living in my head. This is, by far, Christopher Nolan's best film and I believe it to be the best film of the decade so far. Now that I've thought about it, everything about this film worked so well for me. This movie was the quickest 3 hours ever for me and I honestly wish it went on for more. I could have easily watched another hour of that. 

I loved how aggressively edited this movie was. It expects quite a lot of the viewer and it throws them around like a ragdoll but I was still able to follow along. The disturbing perspective pov shots are quite damning to the characters. The intense cacophony of noise while Oppenheimer is losing his mental stability, the way nervousness and anxiety are portrayed with the selective sounds passing through the rumbling and vibrations as his world is depicted as literally vibrating behind him. It's so good. 

I liked the commitment to being very historically accurate. Some of the dialogue, especially during the closed investigation scenes was word for word pulled from transcripts. The attention to small pieces of history that no one else knows about like the line ""God doesn't play with dice."" that is flippantly thrown out by a character near the beginning of the film. That was a whole issue that Einstein had with Quantum Mechanics and caused him to reject it for so long as well as become rejected, himself, by the leaders of the new sciences. General Relativity and QM couldn't be reconciled back then. I only know of all of this because I grew up watching NOVA episodes about physics like Fabric of the Cosmos. I loved seeing it referenced in the movie and I'm wondering how few caught the importance of that line. For reference, Einstein argued that Quantum Mechanics didn't make any sense because of it's inability to be predicted and its trends towards chance. Another physicist, one whose name I have forgotten and who was on the QM side, responded to Einstein saying something like ""Don't tell God what he can do."" I like that they included the bits about Pile 1 under the stands. That's another thing few people know about. 

I actually quite liked how it basically turned into a whole different movie for the last hour. People minimize the importance of what was happening by saying stuff like ""It was boring. It was just about a stupid security clearance."" In reality, that security clearance represented both Oppenheimer's ability to continue influencing the U.S.' nuclear programs and having pull as well as representing his reputation. The revoking of his clearance was a disaster for him in real life and was an attack on his reputation. This is also the part of the movie with the best acting. Robert Downey Jr. deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of Strauss. His facial movements and micro speeches to his aids were incredible. His portrayed of a seemingly softer personality/politician/spiteful and vindictive, and his mix of being soft and also rugged and powerful was one of the best parts of the movie.

Something else I liked about the film was its peculiar story structure. At first I thought it was just a quintessential Nolan nonlinear trope but I noticed something about the way the film was structured. The way the story about the bomb itself was presented was very reminiscent of religious texts like the Bible. I know this is a reach but the film references things like the Bhagavad Gita, the fact that so many of the story's main players were Jewish, and the references to Greek Mythology, I couldn't help but see religious symbolism in the structure of the film. The reality of the bomb is almost symbolically prophesied throughout the first hour of the film as characters make references to things that will occur by happenstance later, like the very real coincidence that Oppenheimer loved the desert southwest and physics and wished he could combine them both. He actually did say that. The small creepy reminders of the future of the bomb are spread out in the first hour similar to how subversive signs of the messiah are spread throughout the Old Testament like the ram with its head caught in a thorn bush to be sacrificed in Genesis 22. I feel like that had to be intentionally done with the story. And don't even start on the blatant water droplet symbolism. 

This is not the same Christopher Nolan as before. This is a new version of him that hasn't been seen before. His last movie, Tenet, was the most Nolany of Nolan films it could possibly have been. This is completely different. This is such a weird film from him with so many elements and approaches he hasn't done before really. 

Also, the ending couldn't have been better. The reveal of the actual nature of what Oppenheimer said to Einstein, the haunting visions of fire, rows of ICBMs, the new successor of the V2, the Earth being consumed. It was such haunting ending and it couldn't have been better.",2023-08-18 22:33:04

"Cilian and RDJ were awesome, really enjoyed Matt Damon in it as well. Wish Josh Peck or Jack Quaid had more scenes lol. Oppenheimer was The Social Network on crack, so many time jumps. I'm a huge science, history, movie, and politics guy. But I thought the movie was good, not GREAT. Just didn't scratch the movie itch. Loved the whole ensemble they got for this film, the music was amazing. The build up for the testing of the bomb was intense. Favorite part of the film was definitely the last hour when they are all in the room questioning Oppenheimer's allegiance to the US.

People expecting a war drama with some action are gonna be wildly disappointed cause this was all Politics. Half my theater was asleep, but this was during the midnight showing.

Understood like 80% of the dialogue, 10% I'm bad with accents, 10% typical Nolan. It's a lot better than TENET which I only understood like 50% of the dialogue in the theater.

Florence Pugh interesting to say the least in her scenes lol.

The only problem I had with the film was how little context I had while watching it.Nolan should have better explained who's who and why they do what they do.The scene with Einstein and Oppenheimer is going to stay with me for ages.,2023-07-21 14:49:57
I have several things I wanna say but I'm gonna start by saying it's fun seeing Alden Ehrenreich on the screen (Lucasfilms did him dirty) and he and RDJ played so well off each other.,2023-07-21 16:27:12
"Really superb in so many ways.

Although, as someone who is relatively uneducated on Oppenheimer and WW2 history, I did struggle to keep track of all the characters, and I was a bit confused during the black and white scenes.

With that said, the cinematography and acting was really something!

Personal pet peeve, but our imax sound was too loud at some points. I understand the artistic intent, but I literally winced with pain in my ears more than once.",2023-07-22 04:31:41
"""Maybe they spoke about something more important""

"I watched this yesterday and am coming to see what people thought 

BUT, I still can’t get over the sick as intro card. I don’t even remember the full quote but as a total casual who didn’t know Prometheus or anything, having that dark line over the nuclear bomb in the back was a great way to start",2023-07-22 05:37:31
"I think it was a good movie

I agree that they could have gone into the Physics part in detail, but I get that the average layperson may not understand all the Physics behind this, so they kept it short and simple

I was actually impressed that they spent a good deal of the runtime on Oppenheimer grappling with the guilt of putting his hands on something so catastrophic. It was amazing that Christopher Nolan showed the humane side of Oppenheimer, and not just a war-raging Physicist.

The ending was also so good. I absolutely loved the way he described how the events are going to shape the world we live in today",2023-07-22 21:54:12
Not gonna lie if I was Oppenheimer I would also go to sleep with crushing guilt every night for the rest of my life for choosing an alcoholic Emily Blunt over a commie Florence Pugh.,2023-07-22 23:05:00
"I thought this would be a straight biopic, a movie in chronological order but Christopher Nolan being Christopher Nolan decided to make it a small puzzle box (just like Dunkirk). I kind of struggled on the first few minutes trying to determine the order of the scenes and fortunately I caught the grasp of it, although I'm pretty sure I'm still wrong with quite a few things.

I have enjoyed every minute of it especially the whole Los Alamos thing. The highlight of the movie is definitely the Trinity Test. The buildup, the score, the sound effects, and the suspense, it all came beautifully. 

I understand now why people say the movie could have ended few minutes after the trinity test. I think the movie could have ended on the scene where they carried Oppenheimer and celebrating the success of the Trinity Test. Freeze the frame there, play some dramatic music, transition to black screen with texts and images telling the aftermath of the bombs (just like how the last episode of Chernobyl ended).

But honestly, I'm so glad we got 1 more hour and a huge fraction of it is courtroom drama. I really love courtroom dramas and I think Oppenheimer did it well. I understand how some people found the last hour boring after all it's hard to top the whole Los Alamos sequence.

Overall, I really love the movie. It's my first time watching in an IMAX theater and I'm glad my first Imax movie is Oppenheimer. I'm still lost on some details because I missed some dialogue due to sound mixing and the characters speaking fast. I guess I've got to find a copy of American Prometheus now just to understand the whole context of the film.",2023-07-23 08:57:09
"It's undoubtedly a great movie, but I do think the hype around it set my expectations too high. 

Unlike most movies it's actually the best right near the end, the start of it didn't really hook me. I especially thought the opening with the loud music and flashy science particles was a bit tacky. The film overall could use some more quieter moments, it would have made the impact of the bomb stand out more and have more impact.

Nonetheless everything else was fantastic. Acting was amazing, Oppenheimer's character was fascinating to watch, especially since the movie doesn't make him into a complete hero but shows him for the incredible but flawed man he was. The dialogue was also excellently written. 
Overall an 8/10. Definitely has a few faults, but it's positives more than make up for it.",2023-07-23 18:42:04
"Honestly the one problem I had with this film was the footage of the trinity test really didn't look like a nuke. After that fantastic buildup sequence and the incredible sound design, it just makes me wonder how amazing that scene would have been if it didn't just look like a standard Hollywood explosion and actually conveyed the scale, horror and destruction that all footage of actual nuclear detonations contain",2023-07-23 22:59:08
"One of the most fast paced movies I've ever seen. It just felt like it was speed running from scene to scene, leaving zero room to breathe.",2023-07-24 01:19:32
Bruh why did  I get goosebumps when Kennedy gets name dropped? Jim Gordon handing Batman Joker's card at the end of Batman Begins type of goosebumps,2023-07-24 05:38:29
"Finally saw it today.  Just some thoughts on the visual effects.

1. I had been braced for a whole year to watch this movie get the explosion/blast completely wrong and have the sound arrive in, whatever, five seconds after the flash.  I am happy to acknowledge that this _manifestly_ did not happen.  In fact, after they went out of their way to show the audience the sound delay for not one but two explosions prior to Trinity, I knew they were going to get this right.  I was very pleased.

2. Mostly.  See, even though the sound arrived after a good half minute (or more like a minute—movie time), there were were a couple of disappointments regardless.  The first was that the _countdown_ to the detonation was classic Hollywood seconds.  Each number counted down at a pace more like two seconds each.  _Ten......... Nine........._  For a movie that took pains to take itself seriously, this unfortunately really stuck out.

3. The other problem was the actual visual effect.  Much brouhaha has been made of the fact that they did not use CGI for this explosion.  But nobody is willing to talk about the fact that this ended up thoroughly betraying the explosion as a practical effect.  It did not look like an atomic test, _full stop._  The imaginary explosion at the very start of the movie (and revealed in the first teaser, for that matter) was, as a result, _a far better effect._  While it is very true that most movie CGI looks fakey because the artists are incapable of matching the believability of practical sets and effects, this is one very _solid_ case in point for using CGI when it's appropriate.  As much as the actual scene in the movie was a triumph, the explosion itself was a ***huge*** letdown.",2023-07-26 00:18:05
"This is the first Nolan movie that I watched in English, with no subtitles (because movie theatre, duh).

I now totally get all the complaints about Nolan's inability/refusal to properly mix the dialogue sound. I kid you not, I must have missed about 40% of the dialogue in the movie, because I just couldn't hear what the characters were saying.

Even the final, most powerful phrase that Oppenheimer said to Einstein was fucking mumbled under his breath, it felt like. Definitely negated the dramatic effect for me.",2023-07-26 20:08:48
I also loved the storm before Trinity test (I only realized it after the movie that its based on reality as well). It’s like Mother Nature trying to stop this horrendous thing from being used.,2023-07-26 20:38:38
[deleted],2023-07-27 03:54:52
"Just saw Oppenheimer and I'm a bit confused on the ending. At the end when we flash back to the pond scene with Einstein and Oppenheimer and he brings up the calculation, the one Oppenheimer brought to a Einstein in the woods, didn't the scene where he brought Einstein the calculation happen after the scene with the pond? I thought Oppenheimer hadn't even joined the program yet when he met with Einstein at the pond, and then much later on was when he brought Einstein the calculation, or am I just confused? In the theater I thought the ending dialogue was a nod at the relativity of time and the way time does not behave the way we expect it to in quantum mechanics but upon googling it I'm not seeing anyone else discussing this and I feel I may have lost something....",2023-08-01 00:55:22

However it’s a really good movie, it’s not for everyone but I believe most can enjoy it. Also the audio mixing is not the best with the dialogue in this movie it’s hard to not hear something important or what’s happening in general.

"I'll give my experience. I saw it at the AMC in NYC, Times Square.  It was the subtitled version, which helped since the sound mixing could have been better at moments.  Regardless the theater was full and it was mostly young people. Like 16-30. Men and women were 50/50. And I even saw some women with pink clothing on so many double dipped. So like some people weeks ago may have thought, Oppenheimer wasn't just a movie for older males, young adults, male or female went to watch it and it made me happy that it appealed to that type of demographics. Even after the movie I saw many friends groups discussing whether dropping the atomic bombs was morally correct which was cool.",2023-07-23 21:15:04

I straight up Googled, ""Can you hear the dialogue in Oppenheimer?"" and the reviews were mixed. The overall consensus seemed to be that you could hear the dialogue better compared to how bad it was in Tenet, but it still wasn't perfect.

"This was definitely one of those Christopher Nolans where you won't expect how the movie was directed & edited. Overall, it was a great film that discusses the life of the person but I sort of felt a bit overwhelmed by the dialogue. But for every actor that came in and delivered their lines, it was very well acted. There's enough story to understand how everyone felt about this situation in a timeline where making nuclear weapons could destroy the world. Very interesting to portray the emotions & reactions of each character.

My only gripe about the film was just the timelines and scene jumping. I know Nolan did this with Dunkirk where the 1st half is scattered then it's all brought back into one sequential timeline at the end. For this movie the Black&White scenes did help. Not a complaint but its a unique way to show the cinematography and story together.",2023-07-31 03:16:42

"Genuinely, well done. Similar to other commenters, this has nothing on Interstellar but this has to be higher on my Nolan films right next to the Dark Knight. The beginning was a rough start, since it was going back and forth I can see people getting lost throughout the first half. Personally, as someone whose second language is English, it was well-paced. If anything, the music sometimes drowned a bit of the dialogue but apart from that, it was grappling my attention from beginning to end. I scratched off half of my nail polish because of the quick pacing (I did jump at a couple of booms).

Edit: A lot of the critiques have been about how Christopher Nolan should've delved more into how compelling Oppenheimer's personal moral dilemmas affected him. If I'm not mistaken, the movie did use ""American Prometheus"" as a reference, and, correct me if I'm wrong, it was a biography by 2 federal agents, not Oppenheimer personally. Though Nolan definitely had to research more on Oppenheimer, I think that the accuracy of American Prometheus is projected. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think it was a great summary of the important events in Oppenheimer's life that led to his justification later in life. I would've loved to see more about why Oppenheimer was at his first school, when he changed career focuses, more on Jean, more on Kitty, and exactly how involved he was with the loyalist at a very dangerous time during Los Alamos. Other than that, I think the film did great by relating the relevancy of the person who made the atomic weapon in the context of the time with the perspective of his field's reactions and concerns around the war matter. 

Was it me or was anyone else led on about Florence Pugh's appearance? I didn't even know Emily Blunt was in the film to begin with because I thought Florence's character was going to have the spotlight (which she did in like 5 scenes compared to Emily Blunt). Everyone was so great, so many familiar faces and unexpected ones made this a cast to remember, personally. Benny Safdie is hot.

Other than that, a great solid movie that is definitely Oscar nominee worthy compared to Barbie (disregarding popularity and more about quality).",2023-07-31 16:15:16
Its a bit too slow in the beginning acts for my tastes but the final act is a brilliant showcase of what Nolan is capable of. That final cross examination scene just before the security clearance verdict cross cutting with Straus's ranting was brilliant.

"Okay, one thing I'm wondering: why the mention of Kennedy near the end? I mean, I get that he was one of the senators who swung against Strauss, but it seems oddly gratuitous.

My personal theory is that it ties in with the ending where Oppenheimer mentions his worry about nuclear annihilation to Einstein. After all, who was president during the Cuban Missile Crisis? I feel like the point that Nolan is getting at is that just as it took people going against what Eisenhower wanted to deny Strauss, so to does it fall to people to avoid the nightmare scenario of nuclear war.",2023-08-20 01:27:39

"I delayed watching Oppenheimer, so I had to watch it at home.

I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.

I walked in expecting a biopic about one of the most important scientific minds in our time, and I got it.

Every scene was important, the tension between the characters was real, and the reveal of Strauss's role was a nice turn in the story.

I enjoyed how the story of a dying star (density begets gravity begets density) was connected to the creation of the bomb and the chain reaction.

The Truman scene was an excellent connection to how Oppenheimer became a pariah, which played out in the security hearing and then the senate.

I wish Kitty was fleshed out more, but damn if Blunt didn't own those scenes.

And yeah, I fan boyed at the introduction of god-level scientists every 10 minutes.

Watching Murphy skirt the lines around the bureaucrats and the scientists gave Oppenheimer such depth. And even though it was an unthinkable evil, the scene planning the actual bombing gave me a new perspective and made me pause.

And then the security hearing a how much I hated Jason Clark.

I could go on.

This is Nolan’s masterpiece. The culmination of everything he’s done. This movie induced so much dread for something you know will happen. I can’t believe this movie is real,2023-07-21 02:52:37
"Oppenheimer reminds me of dining at a Michelin star restaurant. 

You get 15 tiny dishes over many hours: some are life-changing, some are fascinating, and some are just not for you. You leave knowing you experienced something special, but still a little hungry, and not sure if you'd really go again. 

I'd give it a 5/10. Absolutely LOVED the scenes of testing the bomb and Oppenheimer's speech in the gymnasium. The visual and sound effects were 10/10 cinema. The rest of the movie was just too long and a little dull. It's challenging to build suspense when we know the outcome of the bomb/science. I'm hoping Nolan can give us another Inception or Interstellar next because I have little interest in watching this or Tenet again. Hurts as a huge Nolan fan.",2023-08-07 15:49:11
"Personally I came out of this movie a little underwhelmed. My main gripes were the dialogue feeling unnatural, especially towards the beginning of the film. The scene where Oppenheimer reads his, ""I have become death"" quote while in bed with a woman before even starting the Manhattan project stood out especially. But really almost every conversation didnt feel like a real conversation at all, I just kept thinking, people dont talk like this to eachother. It felt like they started with a long list of everything Oppenheimer was known for, then thought about ways they could cram each piece of info into the movie. 

Then there was the visual representations of him having mind blowing revaluations about the universe also causing him great stress. Its like cinematic version of, ""whoa look at how mindblowingly smart am I."" The ending where they mixed in this kind of arthouse feeling by showing the hallucinations really felt out of place.  Really there was quite a bit that just didnt do it for me.

What I did enjoy were the performances. Especially RDJ as Lewis Strauss, he really killed it with that part.",2023-08-09 00:51:57
"What a fantastic movie. It was 3 hours long, but never dragged or felt boring. This is my favorite movie of the year so far. This felt perfect.",2023-07-21 02:24:18

"So, I saw it in imax.  It was very polarizing for me.  The sound effects, the seat shaking booming bass, the music, all amazing and really made all the bomb scenes and tension moments that much more dramatic. 

But I really struggled hearing dialogue, especially with music playing.  Maybe it’s just me and my 46 year old ears but I kept having to ask my son what they said and finally stopped and just watched as I missed some lines.  I look forward to see it again with subtitles.",2023-07-21 23:04:20
"Usually don't like seeing reviews before watching but in this case I'm really *really* glad I did. I knew what I was getting into

Before I thought of it as the atomic bomb movie. The bomb being the climax, the bomb scene being the reason you buy a ticket. Yes its called Oppenheimer, but still hard not to focus solely on the spectacle of the bomb given the trailer + summer blockbuster release + IMAX hype + so much bts talk about how he filmed that scene. etc.

Loved this so much. I was thrilled. But if I had my previous image in mind, this probably would've had a different impact because my mind would be elsewhere. Anticipating something that only comes and goes 2 hours in. 

I think thats what happened to many here, many are clearly disappointed the spectacle of the bomb itself wasn't the point.",2023-07-22 02:03:01
"Idk if anyone else noticed, but it seemed to me that the Color scenes represented Oppenheimer’s perspective while the black & white represented Strauss’.",2023-07-22 07:19:47
"I’ve been going through this thread and many don’t like how anti climatic the bomb test came off. Initially I agreed. However, maybe that wasn’t the climax. I think the real climax was when Oppenheimer gave his speech to the residents of Los Alamos after dropping the bomb on Japan. The residents were clueless to the devastation that just happened. Cheering and applauding. Oppenheimer  was going through a life changing understanding. Picturing every one before him being annihilated by a nuclear bomb. From that point on he made concerted efforts against everything he spent his life to achieve. Maybe my interpretation is wrong, but that scene was really emotional for me. Seeing it in IMAX definitely added emotion to Cillian’s award winning performance.",2023-07-22 19:30:42

"A whole lot of people are going to watch this movie for a meme and then realize that three hours is a really long time

The time jumps in this movie are jarring. I could usually figure out when most scenes were happening but it took a lot of context clues and a decent familiarity with the history of the period that I think a lot of viewers might overlook. Sometimes I was several minutes into a scene before they gave me some idea which storyline it was in. 

There are scenes in this that make the film. The gym scene was amazing. The Truman scene was hilarious. The ending line really worked. On the other hand, this could have been a half hour shorter if they'd cut a good bit of the last hour. The Senate hearings and the security clearance hearings went on and on and on and we got the point long ago. 

Nolan likes reveals too much. There's that name-drop of Kennedy (which doesn't even make sense, Strauss absolutely would have known who Kennedy was at the time that scene takes place) and Einstein earlier in the movie. But he goes so far as to make a big dramatic thing out of revealing what actors are playing what characters. The audience is clearly supposed to go ""OMG it's >!Gary Oldman!<! Wow it's >!Rami Malek!<! Holy crap is that >!Josh from Drake and Josh!<?"" The funniest one for me is that they build up a guy for like a full minute before they show his face and it's just >!Casey Affleck!<.",2023-07-23 08:42:08
"I don’t know why but my favourite scene is when Oppenheimer and Rabi are in Los Alamos while it’s still under construction and Rabi has a moment of vulnerability over what they’re creating. Then when they decide they have to do it, Rabi gets to business and tells Oppenheimer to be himself. 

The music when he’s putting on his hat while staring out the window is so epic and perfect. It just feels amazing.",2023-07-23 16:14:45

I felt like there was never time to settle in to anyone's thoughts or feelings before something else was happening, or some loud music started blaring.  
  
I expect a lot of people will say that the fast pace was the point, that it was meant to illustrate how fast things were moving from his perspective---in fact, I think the rapid pace *lost* some of its illustrative ability in never being contrasted with literally anything slower or calmer.",2023-07-24 03:01:01

"Firstly, Talbot's 'suicide' haunted me, the blink and you'll miss it shot of the gloved hand drowning her head while she screamed and then leaving the shot, was so frightening. I know it's up in the air whether she actually committed suicide or if she was actually murdered because she was a communist with connections to Oppenheimer. But those brief images are just haunting. The sound design was just nightmarish. A lot of this film really did feel like a horror film. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on the nudity? Not like 'those thoughts', and it made sense in the sex scene, 

but when they are sitting across from each other in the room in the chairs. 

I thought it was supposed to mean they saw through each other like 'naked truth' type of thing. Like had they been in bed talking would have been one thing, but they are just having this conversation spaced far a part completely nude in chairs. It was tastefully done and not erotic, though Pugh was gorgeous, but it was just curious to me. Plus we never see Kitty nude and she didn't know of all of Oppenheimer's secrets. So I guess that was the point?",2023-07-26 08:48:18

"Saw it last night

I would say it was good but not great, like most of Nolan's movies; super high production value, great performances, looks great but something felt missing.

I get that the shots were short in order to develop this frenetic pace of the chain reaction of neutrons getting cast off that explode into the long shots but I really dislike short shots so that didn't do much for me.

When I heard Nolan was making an Oppie movie I was worried he was going to miss the most interesting part of his story, which to me is everything that happened after the bomb, but I'm glad that was actually the focus of the movie.

This has been negative sounding for a movie that I enjoyed and thought was good, it's just that every time I see a Nolan movie I think he's one idea away from making something great, and instead just makes good movies -- still leagues ahead of the average movie hitting the theater

I thought it was weird people were criticizing Asteroid City for like parading the super cast as like a look who it is but Oppie definitely had me thinking that in the first 30 minutes. Also this might be the movie that ends the ""nolan right-wing"" stuff",2023-08-09 12:15:23

"Great movie but there was something missing..

Maybe i just had incredible expectations for it and it somehow affect the experience; but compared to to other Cristopher Noal films i missed breathtaking images,  soundtrack, characters.. 
Don't get me wrong i really enjoyed the historical accuracy, the science understanding behind, the acting, the images.. but there was something missing. It didnt make me feel as much as i expected.  I will have to rewatch but not in the same league as interstellar :/",2023-10-18 20:40:26

"Finally watched it. Good to really good movie that could have been great. Acting was great for the most part. RDJ was great for the most part but the end seemed like it was RDJ playing RDJ playing Strauss vs him just playing the roll as he was for the majority of the movie. Throwing Einstein in there for the sake of having that character in it seemed contrived. Yet again they overstate the fear of igniting the atmosphere (just about every other movie does this as well so not that big of a deal). That lame thing in the end when they're asking about the votes and the whole ""that new guy from Mass."" (or whatever it was) when everybody knew who JFK was, given he was a war hero, an obvious frontrunner for the  dem ticket in1960, and Joe Kennedy's son.  Also it just seemed like they flirted with the point that this was the end of scientists being in the forefront of the political debate as well, vs what happened afterwards which is ""just build it or else and we'll worry about the politics""",2023-12-10 23:13:45

"Honestly, I expected to love it, but I kind of disliked it. Performances were stellar, it looked great, the music was great, this is easily Nolan's best dialogue and Oppenheimer is his most fleshed out character.

But I really hate the structure of the movie. There wasn't any reason to keep cutting between the different time periods and I think it mostly added confusion because it's not well established when each one is and what exactly they're talking about. They vaguely mention things that were currently going on in the earlier period but not in any way that felt like it immediately added intrigue. It added frustration. The movie would have been far better if they had played it in chronological order. I'm very tired of Nolan's time altering shenanigans at this point. It worked in Dunkirk because it kept the pace up and eventually paid off with them all intertwining, but there is literally no pay off here to it. There was also a severe lack of clarity given to the passing of time weirdly. They used the glass bowl to show time passing but even then it doesn't give across ""years are passing by"" until Matt Damon says something about it being 4 years of work and the atom bomb is already built.

I also found the movie far too fast paced. I can't really tell you anything about any of the characters because they're not at all fleshed out, which makes them coming back in Act 3 feel weightless and unearned which sucks a lot of the drama out. I'm convinced that's why every character is played by a known actor, otherwise there would be nothing for the audience to grab onto with each one besides maybe Safdie's character I think is called Teller. I think the only character it worked with was Rami Malek, simply because you think he'll be the final nail in the coffin for Oppenheimer and don't know what side he leans on. Cut out all of the pre-professor stuff and use that time to slow the movie down and actually let people understand what the other characters roles were. This is a Biopic, yet it has the same ability to explain to the audience what's going on that Tenet does. This pace would make me annoyed and confused even with a pure action movie.

Speaking as someone who has never read the book or had much exposure to the project beyond the broad essentials, this movie was borderline incomprehensible because of the last two points. I'm sure I'll like it better on a rewatch, but I think that's more of a criticism since that comes from a place of better understanding of what the movie is *trying* to do (and doing independent research to fill in all the gaps the movie leaves out) rather than the rewatch being based on finding new layers and understanding things I couldn't have known until after it was over (like Prestige/Memento)",2023-07-21 19:08:40
"Positives:
* Performances great across the board, mostly Cillian and RDJ
* Intercut effects of Opp thoughts (seeing stars, haunting moral thoughts, gym scene was awesome)
* Tension in first 2 hrs 
* Overall sound design

Negatives:
* Pacing issues, last hour specifically
* Intercutting of 3 different timelines was convoluted and confusing at times
* Trinity test itself was kinda underwhelming, likely due to lack of any CGI made it feel smaller in scale
* Sex scenes were weird and felt out of place
* Unrelenting dialogue which I usually like, just felt hard to connect who was who in 3rd hour without prior knowledge 
* Dialogue sometimes hard to understand, sound mixing sometimes had too much score over dialogue


Curious what other’s thought tho!",2023-07-21 20:43:36
"Just saw it in IMAX.  I loved almost everything about it with a few exceptions:

1. I thought more people would be talking about the choppy dialogue/editing.  It threw off the pacing, going into overdrive during conversations.  It made it hard to follow and scenes weren’t given enough time to fully develop. I wish they slowed down with some scenes especially in the first act. This was my main gripe.  It’s going to be especially harder to follow for the casual viewer with some of the topics discussed.

2.  The bomb was a bit of a letdown.  The buildup was fantastic but it was obvious that they were using the illusion of zoom=big.  I appreciate the dedication to practical effects but they really should’ve blended in some cgi there.  I trust they could make it look authentic.

3. I usually preach about how good the music is in nolan films.  Here was really good too but sometimes the volume really overshadowed some of the dialogue.  

I still would give it a 9/10.  Excellent movie.",2023-07-22 02:52:18

"This movie is the type of movie where you need to know the context and have a bit of understanding of what is going on in order to enjoy it. I saw people leave the theater during the first hour and I can't blame them; the film is very fast paced and doesn't shy away from telling you the story the way it happened, incorporating a lot of terminology used exclusively within the realm of physics and mentioning a lot of events from WW2 and the Red Scare. These are not things the layman theatergoer will enjoy if they don't know or at the very least aren't interested in them.

But if, like me, you're a fan of nuclear physics and its history, then you'll enjoy it a lot. I know I did. Easily a 9/10.",2023-07-24 03:28:09
"Reading the comments here I’m probably far into the minority, but I didn’t really like it.

The pacing made it difficult to emotionally invest in the outcome of any scene. The entire film was a giant montage. The story meandered and wasn’t very coherent (I know Nolan likes to play with time). The visual sequences were underwhelming.

I did however thoroughly love the cast and acting.",2023-07-24 08:35:12

The build up to the test was gripping. The explosion itself didn't live up to the hype, but that's a reflection on me as a moviegoer who grew up on Terminator movies. 


The speech/hallucination sequence where Openheimer addresses his staff was brilliant. It was so powerful that it impacted the rest of the film. The stakes in the dual hearings weren't high enough to overcome the loss of momentum. I just wanted to know what Einstein said ffs. However the payoff was worth the wait and one the best endings in recent memory.",2023-07-27 00:02:36

Multiple groups were talking *during the bomb scene* and tons of people were on their phones throughout. I honestly don't think a lot of people have the attention span for 3 hour historical biopics anymore. I'll probably rewatch it once it gets a streaming release so I can enjoy those moments without the disruptions.

With the way that scene is shot it brought to mind Cosmic Horror, something right out of the pages of a Lovecraft scene. Seeing the fireball rise higher and higher brought images of an Old One awakening from a long slumber. A sight so horrible so alien that even thinking of it drives one to insanity. It was horrifying. Throughout the sequence my hands were gripping my hair in anxiety. And with the way Nolan shoots it, it's as if the movie is telling me ""You were not made to witness this"".",2023-08-01 21:28:06

"I watched this movie in IMAX and I'm in a conundrum. Wonderful *experience*, but I have no big rush in seeing it again and I honestly don't think it'd work outside of theaters. I'm 100% a go see in theaters kinda guy for movies like this, MI, Avatar, ATSV, something that utilizes the theater format to its absolute limits and this quite easily did. On a technical level this film is a genuine 10/10, the sound design, the editing is impeccable.   


But on a personal emotional level... Idk? Should I feel ""less intellectual"" because I didn't come out of the movie really feeling anything else? I loved the movie's technical aspects but I just don't really resonate it with it beyond that like I did with movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once. I try to not see myself as a snob but I also don't see myself as a complete normie either, I loved EEAAO but I personally loved Top Gun Maverick over EEAAO because it did what Oppenheimer did last year, give you an experience that can pretty much only be felt, be truly appreciated in theaters.   


The blast itself also didn't work too well for me. I get the tension building, I get the intention but I guess I wanted an atomic bomb to feel like it'd engulf you, like you couldn't outrun it, like it'd destroy an entire city, which it did but I just don't feel like the scale was conveyed nearly as much as I hoped it would.

I definitely do not hate nor love the film, I feel like it's a very solid 8/10 from me just on the technical feats alone",2023-07-25 08:27:27
"I'm seeing a lot of people disappointed and underwhelmed with the movie. And I'm not sure if it's because of the marketing or what their expectations of it were.

Personally I felt this movie was a mix of The Social Network and Tàr. Part courtroom drama, part psychologcial drama with classic Nolan intercutting between timelines. And for what it's worth I feel it's his best movie yet. 

The Trinity Test really landed for me but I think a lot of people wanted to see the bang but Nolan went for the psychological impact of it all, with the music cutting out and ""I am become Death.."" right before the shockwave and I respect that and it really worked for me. But I can see how that might have underwhelmed someone who was expecting a proper Big Bang mushroom cloud.",2023-07-25 12:35:10
"My main thought is, this is not a “summer blockbuster”.  This feels like a winter Oscar movie type release.",2023-07-26 01:57:51
"I rewatched the movie last night and I was still left totally baffled. I'm definitely recommending a rewatch because it allows you to enjoy the story more after the shock on the first watch. So i just want to write this down somewhere in order to remember this interpretation and try to see other peoples thoughts on it. Im aware that it might end up too long but no pressure in reading it all its just my interpretation of this absolute masterpiece.

Well obviously there are 4 of the most disturbing scenes in the movie. The Trinity testing, Oppenheimers speech after the Hiroshima bombing, interrogation of Oppenheimer in his hearing and the last scene where he discusses the future with Einstein. All of those scenes have something in common. The same build up music is happening each time. We can hear violent violins which absolutely demolished me in IMAX. Then we can hear the loud beats
(Trinity- countdown, 
speech - people banging their feet, 
interrogation - the way they start speaking louder and louder
lake scene - again we hear similar banging as in speech scene representing drops of a bomb arsenal that was shown) 
and in the end of each build up there is obviously a large boom(representing the explosion) and horror of people witnessing it.

So then it struck me.

1. Trinity testing

        We can see Oppenheimers experience of it and the way he repeats the phrase ""Now i am become Death the destroyer of worlds"" indicates that he realized what power they/he unleashed into the world. That also represents the start of his guilt and torcher.

And then suddenly everything changes. From him being the main guy now the military took the bombs away and he needs to wait to see how the military will use them. He knows the destructive capabilities of them. You can see him being troubled waiting in the night of 6th of August. But after the bombing was successful that's just it nobody is in shock or feeling remorse instead people are congratulating him. So idk i felt like when he got praise instead of judgement thats where things went wrong for him.

2. Speech after the Hiroshima bombing 

        Before the speech scene we can actually hear the violin melody again the same as in the Trinity testing. Again the visuals distort and we can see bright flashes of light symbolizing the explosion. We can see Oppenheimer saying the things he doesn't feel at the moment like hes been out of his body and then him screaming in the end of the speech and people clapping which represents the explosion once again. So in a way even though we and Oppie didnt experience the Hiroshima bomb (Little boy) he and us gets to feel it at that moment. 

Even years after Oppenheimer obviously still feels guilty. We see that first in his meeting with the president where he says ""I feel like i have blood on my hands"". Second time we see him feeling guilt is in the midst of the unfair hearing which he voluntarily accepts as some kind of a martyr. At the moment his wife confronts him with sentences ""When will you fight back"" and ""Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you the world would forgive you?"". 


3. The hearing of Oppenheimer representing Nagasaki bomb

     In the hearing Oppenheimer is actually being silent the whole time and refuses to fight back. The climax of the hearing is when Roger Robb (i think) interrogates Oppenheimer himself. The scene starts with the violins playing again. Again the camera distorts and flashes show up. During the whole scene they are actually talking about the moral of the atomic bombing and why Oppenheimer declined to be involved in the development of H-bomb. And in the climax of the tensions both of them start screaming at each other representing the same sound from the A Bomb explosion. So in a way we can actually feel the Nagasaki bomb (Fat man) or the second real bombing that happened from Oppenheimers perspective because he didnt actually get to feel both bombs that he created he only heard of the horrors that they caused. 

4. Build up representing the possible nuclear war apocalypse

    And now we skip the trials all the way to the ending. We can see the ending scene where Oppenheimer talks to Einstein about the chain reaction that they might have started. Nolan shows the whole disturbing arsenal of modern atomic weapons. Earth's atmosphere is collapsing and burning. We see the horror of what might happen if that happens for the ""fourth time"". The violins start building up the tension again. In the middle of their convo we can hear loud bangs that represent the A bombs dropping. In the climax of it all Oppenheimer(Cillian) closes his eyes expecting to hear a loud boom but instead the movie ends and leaves us without actually hearing the fourth explosion. So the last build up represents the tensions in the world and build up towards the apocalyptic nuclear war and absence of the boom represents the hope that humanity isn't dead and that we won't let that happen.

Sorry for this being so long its just that Nolan created a fking masterpiece and i want to understand it better so feel free to add up something or correct me if you think the interpretation is not correct. Also the rewatch was amazing and i would recommend it every time. 10/10 movie for me.",2023-07-26 10:10:24
Cilian murphy was mesmerizing. Rdj evolved from tony stark to Strauss in the monologue .,2023-07-26 17:14:05
Cillian Murphy gave one of the best performances I've ever seen. Very few times I've ever been as stressed about and for a main character than Murphy here. It's fascinating to see Oppenheimer's charisma in his domain (the classroom/lab) and then a place where he's uncomfortable and helpless (the private subcommittee). Murphy just didn't miss the entire movie IMO.,2023-07-27 16:02:03
"I thought there was something really cool about how this movie used the American desert town as a set-piece.  A hastily built town with a lone architect ruling over the whole thing, all so that they could extract as much value as they could from it - literally dropping nuclear waste all over it - and then abandoning the ruins and deciding to “return it to the Indians”.  Not a fully formulated thought but it’s yet another layer to this movie I thought was interesting.",2023-07-29 03:52:47
"I really enjoyed this and will definitely be watching it again, but the pacing in the first act was so jarring. It honestly felt like I was watching a trailer for Oppenheimer and not the movie itself.",2023-07-29 23:54:58
"Overall, I think it's a really interesting picture, and a solid biopic of the man. Cillian Murphy really does the title role justice, and although there is a strong supporting cast, I think only a couple manage to stand out - Downey Jr,  and David Krumholtz. Maybe Josh Hartnett. 

I don't think Emily Blunt's character was particularly well developed, and there were maybe too many characters overall.

The first two thirds are rapid and build a real excitement for the project being undertaken. This is certainly the heart of the movie. However, once the bomb goes off, I think the film loses its way a little.

Very little is done to really show the atrocities of what took place. There is one scene where Oppenheimer addresses a rabid crowd, and it begins to suggest there is a real horror to what has happened. But it also feels that a number of opportunities were lost to really do something with that. 

Also, the final third seems more preoccupied with whether he was a Communist or not as opposed to what the ramifications of dropping the bomb were. Obviously it was a key part, but not quite what I was looking for in that section of the film. And with the black and white segment reaching its conclusion, you can't help but draw parallels with Memento and The Prestige, and think Nolan couldn't help wrap it in a puzzle with a surprising conclusion. But what was the need for the puzzle? What did it matter who was behind it all?  The entire B&W sequence could have been lost, and I genuinely think the film would have been no worse off.",2023-07-30 20:22:43
"Visually, the film was stunning, (As per the usual of Nolan's work). After reading some of these comments, I find it odd that some people are so negatively receptive to a film that doesn't necessarily follow a linear, typical story path. The film was completely unpredictable, and I loved it. Also, the sound accuracy/delay during the explosions' was simply impeccable to hear. And what a great way to begin and end a film!",2023-07-31 08:16:06
Just saw it. Loved it. I just wish they kept the book title American Prometheus instead.,2023-08-02 20:20:03
"First Man (2018) was better than Oppenheimer CMV

So I just finished Chazelles' First Man (2018) and I have to say all in all I think it was a better movie than Oppenheimer. While both are incredible pieces of work and both have their flaws. (If there was one more crash zoom in First Man I would have thrown up). The reason I compare the two movies is that they're both about two of the most famous engineer/scientists of all time and both take place within two decades of each other. Both also I believe discuss some of the most important advancements in science of all time, and both try to capture visually an experience seen by so few.  
  
Both have a fabulous score but the silences used in First man really enhance the score overall. The pacing in First Man felt better also. I would say the performances are on par. I think what's interesting is I would say in Oppenheimer Nolan was able to make extremely captivating dialogue scenes and included some great abstract visuals while Chazelle favored a more basic, faux documentary approach to First Mans cinematography (At times some of the scenes on earth felt like watching an episode of Succession) But where First Man really wins out I think is in those scenes that capture going to space especially the opening scene and the last act.

I saw it in a foreign country so we had subtitles and I tell you, reading the subs, trying to watch the movie and keep up with the story, the different timelines, while it all went what felt like 200 mph, was exhausting. There are a lot of things I didn’t get because of it and I feel like it would have been a much more pleasant watch if it wasn’t so rushed. I really felt exhausted after the end from trying to keep up. The only time we really had a “pause” is for the Trinity Test scene. 

Does anyone feel the same? That being said, I really enjoyed the movie, especially the scene where he gives the speech after the bomb had already went off. Truly haunting",2023-07-21 09:03:02

On top of that, almost every scene surprised me seeing some big name side character that distracted me from the story. Ex: why tf is Josh Peck the one detonating the test bomb.

"""...and if someone builds a bigger ̶b̶o̶m̶b̶ blockbuster""

As typical Nolan delivers and if you love history and science, or just a great movie, this is it.

This better win Best Picture, Best Directory, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (multiple), Best Sound and others. It is such a marvel of entertainment and really delivers on matching the book and history pretty well (minus some of the Soviet spies).

They also did Truman dirty. Truman realized the Soviet Octopus after the [Iranian Crisis of 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_crisis_of_1946), created the CIA in reaction to Soviet intel outgunning the FBI, continued the work of UN, [created NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO#History) and started the [Truman Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine). Russia hates two presidents the most, Truman and Carter. Truman for the Truman Doctrine/CIA/NATO and Carter for the [Carter Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Doctrine).

"It has been a long time since a movie ended and I was at a loss for words, once the credits hit I was more than content with just sitting in silence for a while. Recently at work, my projects have been based on making new things far more than they've been about maintaining existing things, and these aren't dangerous things, it's just software, but this movie should be able to speak to anyone that has been involved in a design and implementation process. What makes this movie worth sticking out is the ways that this bomb shapes people's lives before, during, and after the explosion, and the way that Nolan shows this by mixing these points in time throughout the movie. The sound design was phenomenal, I think the best way to describe parts of it would be weaponized silence, it's rare to get jump scared by things that you can see coming, and somehow in the moment it didn't feel like a cheap move for tension when it happened. I'd say 8/10 overall but I really want to watch this a second and third time at some point and see if that changes.",2023-07-22 07:26:17

"This was a lovely movie.

I really liked the explosion scenes sound design. When they were talking about distance (that the closest observers would be ~10 km away) I was thinking: then the sound should take ~30 s to arrive, but they might do it instantly, so I was very happy when they didn't.

I really liked how they portrayed his inner self. Some of the scenes had me feeling absolutely disgusted.

So great movie 8-)

It did suffer from a common science movie problem though.  The ""sitting in circles around a guy talking"" thing. There is no way he would have given talks or had discussions without a blackboard.",2023-07-22 23:16:59
"I've thought about it more, I think given Nolan's intention of relying on things being in camera and using film, this was an incredible achievement. Sure a larger trinity explosion would have looked cooler but I felt like the fire, seeing the character's reactions, and the actual sound of the explosion helped sell it extremely well.


The character drama was pretty well done. I basically only have small nitpicks. I didn't initially get that Oppenheimer was mocking Strauss at all, I did feel like maybe a little bit extra to sell that plot line or make it a bit clearer would have helped. I know people wanted to see hiroshima and I think it would have been an interesting creative choice if during those sequences where Oppenheimer was in the plane flying by at night, if we had looked out his window and saw the bombing, almost as if he was imagining it and he himself was pulling the trigger. I think thats what they were going for with those scenes, but a bit more to sell it could have been maybe cool. But I just think overall, it was a great movie. Glad i got to see it in 70mm, hope other people try the format if they are going to rewatch it. I might try to make the trek to a 70mm imax theatre if they are showing it in a few weeks since all the seats are sold out",2023-07-22 23:38:50

"Just got back.  What an incredible triumph of film.  It's wild how they combined such a dense and thoughtful movie with such an intense sensory experience.  Just a phenomenal piece of film making.

I give it a rock-solid 9/10, but that point off is subjective for me; I totally understand 10/10 ratings.  My main gripe is the glossing over of the scientific aspects.

My sense has always been that developing the bomb was an unreal, UNREAL intellectual achievement, akin to ants inventing a shovel, but Nolan seems more interested in how the ants danced around each other.  And, I mean, I get it: you can't make a movie of just chalkboard calculations and lectures.  I just found it really hard to be as impressed as I've always been by the scientific success of the project while at the same time being sympathetic for someone's security clearance.  Nolan wrought some really great drama out of a humongous historical event (with help from the book, of course), but in a large way I would have rather seen more, well, nerd shit.

Still.  Total crush job.  They really don't make 'em like that, do they?",2023-07-23 04:15:42
"Just got out. I thought it was Outstanding. 

I liked how the story was told. How it jumped from year to year. I loved the focus on the science community that was developing this idea. But I didn’t think there was too much over-saturation on one aspect. You could probably make a 3 hour film just on one theory. 

The acting was superb- it was GREAT seeing so many familiar faces, even if they were covered up with makeup. This film has its own weight to it- but it did give me a great JFK(by Oliver Stone) feeling in that just about every scene a very well known actor appears. 

Just like in many of Nolan’s films- the use of sound was incredible. When to build soundscapes, when to use silence. I got the chills a few times throughout the movie. 

I know the Oscars are pretty much baloney these days- but this film is definitely the film to beat. And I’m positive Nolan is going to win Best Director. 

Really nice to see an intelligent, well written film in the movie theater again.",2023-07-23 04:27:48
"I have a scene I was confused on. The one about norwegian isotopes or something?

I thought Tokyo and Kyoto weren't targets because of the massive bombing campaigns reducing them to rubble already, but that wasn't mentioned, there was no reference to public opinion on the bombings, only brief mention of the Japanese no surrender resolve.

White technically it is a good film, there was no need for it to be non linear. For the longest time I  didn’t know if the hearing with Jason Clarke was before or after the black and white stuff. 

Also wayyyy too many characters in this movie. And they’re played by mostly famous people and the people in my theatre were like “hey that’s Hughie from the show The Boys! Oh that’s the guy from stranger things!”

Overall I’d still give it a 7.5. It did have some emotional moments. And the last line was amazingly poignant.

"Lots to be said about this movie, but I feel like there's already many great comment in here. 

If anything, all I'll add to the thread is that after watching this type of Nolanesque biopic, I'd genuinely love one to be made about Nikola Tesla. 

From his upbringing to his demise, mixing in his love life, inventions, money issues, etc., his peticular mind and moral compass would be as interesting as Oppenheimer's to dissect. Keeping in mind how the movie was wrote and filmed, I can't help but wonder how the exploration of his relationship with Edison and the conflict of perspective would have unfold in light of what we saw of the Oppenheimer/Strauss relationship which was already quite captivating.

All in all, not Nolan's best but solid nonetheless.",2023-07-25 06:54:35
"Like all Nolan films this one looked great visually with top-notch cinematography and amazing sound design. Best scene in the film for me would definitely have to be the Trinity test. Also, great acting all around which is to be expected from a stellar cast like this.

The only negative I could think of is that sometimes the plot was a bit difficult to keep up with especially for someone such as myself who didn't know much about Oppenheimer or the development of the atomic bomb going into the film. The very high number of characters that were included in the film didn't help either for a casual film fan who was not well versed in this particular aspect of history.

**Overall** ***Oppenheimer*** **(2023) rating: 9/10, a visual and audio feat definitely worth seeing in theaters. The 3 hours didn't seem that long considering how much history was included, though the plot and characters may be difficult to keep track with for casual film fans not familiar with the history surrounding the main protagonist.**",2023-07-25 17:02:04

Like what was the last line he said to Einstein that made him depressed? Because I legit didn't understand what he said it was just muffled mumble. He asked if Albert remembered when he brought the papers about destroying the atmosphere, and he said yes then Oppenheimer said something and Albert walked away.",2023-07-27 21:46:58

That he wanted things to go his way cause he wanted the whole thing to be about him so he can be a martyr? Why wasn't Oppenheimer fighting back? He wanted his whole life to be stripped apart in public, so he could feel better?

Oppie looked really cornered in that scene but that just could be the burden of what happened making him feel guilty, even though that's not what he wanted.

Also what was the humiliation exactly that Oppie did to Strauss (that he made fun of big executives while coming there with him) and was it that bad that it was one of major reasons why he had to go that far against Oppie? Or was it mainly about him not going through with H Bomb?",2023-08-06 10:00:46

For the black/white scenes, was the white balance changing? Sometimes it had a very light tint of blue and other times it had a very light tint of green on my IMAX 70MM film screening at AMC at Universal.

"That was possibly the most terrifying film I've ever seen. >!And not just because of Oppenheimer's final vision, either. It was because of the way petty grievances, unchecked egos and the irony that both Oppenheimer and Strauss suffered the same fatal flaw -- their hubris in the belief that they were the ones who understood the situation and could control everything -- is ultimately what would bring the final vision about.!< I'd love to teach it in my English class if I could.",2023-07-21 13:45:19

Genuinely thought the detonation scene could have been a landmark in cinema history. The build up to the detonation had my heart racing. The ability to convey the inconceivable power and destruction of an atomic bomb detonation without using CGI would have been an enormous achievement, but I just thought it looked like any other explosion - which an atomic bomb explosion isn’t. 

That’s my only gripe with the movie. The rest is incredible.",2023-07-21 22:56:12
"I feel like your experience with the movie strongly depends on what you expect from it and who you are.
If you expect a ""hurr durr big bomb go boom"" action-movie, you'll be disappointed. If you don't care about history, physics or politics, this movie won't be for you. If you watch the movie mainly because you want to see the big explosion of a nuclear bomb, you'll certainly be disappointed. Yes, the movie has some great images, but it's not about those.

This movie is an amazing biopic and a dramatic look into the depths of a man who was harrowed by his own invention. If you don't care about his story, then obviously, this won't be your movie. 

Some scenes didn't feel really organic to me, but they were needed for context for people who don't know Oppenheimers story. 

The movie is not about nuclear bombs, it's about the insides of the man who invented them, and it does an amazing job portraying just that.",2023-07-22 07:05:54

"I've read American Prometheus and this is an issue I had with it as well: the Strauss stuff(and really the communist stuff in general) just isn't that interesting. Like there's really not much at stake there. I understand it must have been a difficult time for Oppenheimer personally, but why should we care? If anything being stripped of his security clearance was great for his legacy as it made him a martyr of the red scare when actually he was out there naming names (including implicating his students and colleagues). Also, even having prior knowledge of the subject it was hard for me to follow everyone's motivations... like who was Rami Malek's character and how is he suddenly so important?

I also don't like the trope of the scientist as some kind of mystic. I remember there was one really cheesy line, I forget it but the gist was ""you've seen into the mysteries of the universe how can you navigate the real world now."" The movie treats studying quantum mechanics as if it's some kind of ayahuasca retreat... it's just math.",2023-07-22 13:52:56

"I might get downvoted for this, but I'm glad they didn't feature the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a couple reasons: 

1. It would have felt *so* exploitative- I saw a lot of people before the release talking about going to the movie *only* because they heard it had practical effects and big explosions, and it wouldn't have done justice to the *real suffering and tragedy* 
2. The movie wasn't about the atomic bomb, it was about Oppenheimer. The way he and the rest of Los Alamos, and the world, found out about the bombings was horrifying in itself - the sudden news and slow realization of the aftermath
3. The Trinity Test already did a great job showing the almost eldritch, otherworldly horror of the atomic bomb - it was the first time the scientists who created it *really* comprehended what they created, the cinematography did a great job of showing how destructive the bomb was - even in the middle of a desert. It leaves the horror of what such a force could do to a major city uncertain and speculative to both the scientists and the audience at that moment",2023-07-23 07:05:00

There were so many cuts with a constant score that the movie felt more like a 3 hour long trailer than a 3 hour long movie. Cilian looks like Oppenheimer but his American accent was not good enough for this level of movie. It was Benedict Cumberbatch in the first Doctor Strange bad.

"The trinity test is one of the greatest moment and will be remembered in cinema history. Everyone was so captivated that there was pin drop silence in a fullhouse theatre no munching popcorn, no squeaky chairs nothing. That truly showcases the beauty of the movie.  It's might sound generic but literally all aspects were great and work together so well collectively to tell the story beautifully the visuals, the music, the cinematography... Best biography I've seen hands downs, being historically accurate while also being so much fun and captivating is truly the beauty of Nolan's direction. I'm not being a fanboy but Nolan deserves all the credit here, most of the story is about a single person and he's the person of focus most of the time yet Nolan manages to keep everyone hooked for every single moment of the 3hours. Even after the movie ended I just sat there till after the end of credits and not because the movie felt incomplete but rather because it's truly complete and you're just sitting there thinking through it knowing what a great time you had and acknowledging that's it the movie has ended.

I feel the critique mostly comes from people who lack some basic understanding of the history of The Trinity project , the war and some basic concepts of the bomb.

Would highly recommend to watch veritasium's [yt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzv84ZdtlE0) about oppenheimer which helps a lot.",2023-08-09 16:01:15
Good film with some fantastic acting though I did think it was a bit overrated.  It suffered from the Nolan problem of every character having the same voice and I was getting bored at the interrogation scenes between the Trinity tests and the end.  Did definitely pick up at the end again though.  It also had the issue with biographical dramas where there's a whole ton of characters and events tossed in that were real and so needed to be there for historical accuracy sake but they hardly get any screentime.  Too many characters that you never get to know here.  Also the bomb explosion was kinda underwhelming even if the Trinity test scene itself was incredible.,2023-08-12 20:23:55
"I'm disappointed by one small fact not one of the Japanese casualty were shown - on more than one occasion they gloss over the numbers, and the manner in which they died.

I would not even put oppehemier in Nolan's top 10.",2023-09-22 07:19:28
"Yeah this film isn't as good as people hyped it up to be. 

The physics part and the bomb construction and Cillian Murphy is good. RDJ is good. The acting is good.

But someone please explain to me why I should care about the Communists, who don't achieve anything in the film? And why its such a huge thing? Also why should I care about Oppenheimer's security clearance?? Especially, when at the end he's still celebrated for his achievements by all his science buddies. 

I think the movie expects you to have deeper knowledge of stuff in comparison to just ""oh that's the guy who made the nuke""

It's such a slug to get through with 3 hours that could have been cut down, so easily. But it isn't.

I wish I could see what others see. But from a first viewing, this just isn't amazing. It's fine.",2023-10-07 23:56:45
"What a mess of a movie. I think I'm officially done with Nolan.

Constant time jumping can't hide the fact that the characters were shallow, the dialogue was exposition and not spoken by real humans, and this movie tried to explore 3 stories and failed to explore any as a result.

I burst out laughing during the third act when it's supposed to be this huge twist that Strauss is a villain. Like at that point in the movie who gives a shit about Strauss?

Woof.",2023-12-25 18:04:57

"So I just saw the movie, and it was pretty fantastic.  
Christopher Nolan is one of the most well-established auteurs working today, and this might be his biggest monumental achievement.  
This is a great character study of the man who made the Atomic Bomb.  
There are so many nuances behind Cillian Murphy's performance, as well as the writing of the performance.  
All of the other actors played their roles effortlessly, and both the editing and score really COMPLEMENT the tone of the film.  
My only real complaint is that the sound mixing was a little distracting at times. But it definitely wasn't as bad as TENET, which was his previous movie.  
  
Overall, I'm giving this a 9 out of 10.",2023-07-21 23:55:08
"I have some mixed feelings about the film. Overall I enjoyed it, but I think the first hour is a little strange, and in the end exhausts you a little bit. Someone else said it, but it feels a little bit like a very long trailer. I understand it needed to be there, otherwise you’re getting thrown straight into Los Alamos, which would be a terrible starting point. 

The 2nd act (mostly Los Alamos) flows much better, but isn’t perfect. Damon’s introduction as Groves seems to streamline the film, and as a result makes it more enjoyable. Cillian also gets a more linear storyline, and as a result shines more.

The 3rd act I feel is the best. RDJ should be looking at a supporting actor nod. He is absolutely convincing as Lewis Strauss, to the point where I was forgetting it was him playing the character. He is vindictive, ambitious, intelligent and spiteful, but he isn’t cartoonishly evil. Brilliant acting. 

Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is outstanding. He successfully portrays this incredibly complex character, and in the end he’s not some paragon of virtue who fought against the establishment, but he’s also not a despicable womaniser and coward who gave in at every opportunity. He’s both, and he’s much more compelling for it. 

For the rest of the “side” characters, I don’t think anyone put in a bad performance. Blunt, Affleck, Damon, Clarke, Malek, Oldman and whoever else were all brilliant.

Also, I think a reading of *American Prometheus* massively helps in understanding all the different characters. Oppenheimer, Chevalier, Lawrence, Tatlock, Kitty, Fermi, Einstein, Strauss, Feynman, Rabi, Tolman, Szilard, Groves, Pash, Bohr, Bethe, Robb, Serber, Bush, Borden, etc. These are all names that are really hard to remember in the space of a few hours. Over 600 pages however, they’re much easier to follow. 

Overall I’d say a 7 or 8 out of 10. If it were 2.5 hours or even 2 hours, I think it would be a 10/10, but that’s an admittedly hard task for a biopic about Robert Oppenheimer.",2023-07-22 00:42:28
"I have not read through all the comments yet but one thing I haven't seen is the talk about scorpions. Oppenheimer compares the US & Russia race to scorpions killing themselves and he and Strauss ended up doing that, they both lost security clearance.",2023-07-22 03:39:31

And the best part is the moments leading to the trinity test, the music keep getting more intense with the countdown and everyone’s reaction. And since there’s a lot “jumpscare” with loud sfx many times before, you’re ready for the loudest shit the bomb is going to sound

Only for it happened and its dead silence. Truly an experience",2023-07-22 13:17:39
I don’t think Nolan was able to convey the motivation of Downey Jr’s character to ruin Oppenheimer. Nolan showed it in a very casual way and it was early on in the film when it was jumping around timelines quite a bit. Maybe I just missed it but I didn’t fully grasp it. I can read why but the movie should have done it for me especially since the plot depended on it so much with the ending and payoff.,2023-07-22 20:50:22
"Just left the film and I thought it was tremendous. If you ever get a chance visit the Atomic Museum in Vegas. They start with a description of the destructive capacity of the atomic bomb to set the stage and then walk through all of the developments up through the modern era, placing each step in the context of the original bomb. It’s difficult to grapple with. 

Visiting the Bomb Dome in Hiroshima is also a powerful experience, along with the book Hiroshima by John Hersey.

"I’m wondering why Nolan made Jean so emotionally captivating and not Kitty. I actually didn’t like Kitty at all as a character (not that it wasn’t done well, but rather not sympathetic to her at all). 

The line where she says something like “you don’t get to sin and expect everyone to feel sorry for you having consequences” felt incredibly hypocritical. But maybe that was the point. Kitty appeared to be suffocated by her life with Oppenheimer and miserable (not just the post partum), and that line seemed like it could just as easily be said to her. She cheated on her husband with Oppenheimer, got pregnant, and as far as the movie goes, the only redeeming scene she had for her character was the interrogation. That line just read more as bitter than as truth to me. 

Jean, on the other hand, was very likable *because* of her bad qualities. The use of warm colors in her scenes was intentional; she felt like “home”. And her tossing the flowers in the trash got a laugh from everyone. The only times Oppenheimer was shown being vulnerable was with her, especially when he told her he’d always answer when she calls. They were the only scenes Oppenheimer showed any emotion other than worry. 

So idk. I’m wondering why he decided to tell the story that way.",2023-07-23 05:50:07
"I'd be genuinely curious what people rate this in the Nolan catalogue, for themselves. 

To me, I can think of 4-5 (at minimum) other Nolan movies that I would rewatch over this, if given the opportunity to do so. *Better* movies in his repertoire, I'm not sure, maybe a few (for me - Interstellar, Prestige, etc.).

Does rewatch-ability factor into how great people consider a movie? For example, I don't think I'd ever watch this movie again, but I can admit it was good.",2023-07-23 23:12:40

"Just watched it on a big screen. First impressions are that the first hour of the film felt like it was a big extended trailer for an unseen 20 minute version of the first half. Way, way too much fast editing and over use of music to cram a lot into what should have been a chance to slow character build and ramp up to the second act.

The fast paced editing didn't let up for most of the 2nd hour, but actually worked to provide a sense of urgency and uncertainty for 'the project'. Ironically the time between edits do slow down at the Trinity test scenes (and worked in my opinion).

Much of the third hour kinda worked but I felt like the B+W scenes for Strauss's nomination felt a little forced, like it needed to be there to counteract the Oppenheimer hearing scenes.

Acting was incredible and should have been as even background characters where played by A listers. I'd like to re-watch it to see if my opinion of it gets better over time. But ATM I feel like the recent crop of Nolan films are coasting on his name and by any other director would be seen as good films rather than the genius he is portrayed to be.

"I think the movie was told in layers just leading up to the final scene which was incredibly interesting and impactful. But I feel it suffered precisely because of it. Personally I’d have preferred if they told the story linearly and just cut to that moment with Einstein at the end. This intercutting between timelines and constant music overlapping the dialogue became tiresome in its three hour runtime. Like this felt like a movie of moments, not scenes. 

Definitely not Nolan’s best. He continues his alarming sound-mixing technique even in this movie. It’s a shame. He’s such a talented filmmaker. But he really needs to hire someone better for editing, sound-mixing & screenwriting.",2023-07-22 16:31:26

Princeton. Berkeley. Radiation Labs. Caltech. Rand Corporation. OakRidge. Los Alamos. The Berkeley Cyclotron which brought us Berklium, Californium and Lawrencium.  ETA: Not only did they mention the sites, but much of the film was shot on location on those sites.  It was heartwarming.

The American Presidents of the mid-century who championed policies based on facts and science for early forty years: Roosevelt. Truman. Eisenhower. Kennedy. Johnson.

Did anyone else think that the scene where Oppenheimer dons his outfit with the hat and pipe felt like a scene in a superhero film when the hero finally puts on his costume? Probably just me but damn did that moment feel special.",2023-07-21 03:54:05
"Before seeing it (in regular 70mm) I thought it was really cool that he did the whole film without CGI and fully analog process. After the movie, I fail to see what he really gained by it. Sure, it’s neat… and for 99% of the film it’s a perfectly valid choice that didn’t come with many major drawbacks. But then there’s the actual nuclear explosion, and yeah, he captured the atmosphere of it, but visually it was… underwhelming. It would probably have been better to not show it at all, honestly. Just show the light on people’s faces, their reactions. Seeing that big-but-hardly-nuclear plume that really didn’t appear much bigger than anything I’ve seen on Mythbusters or, hell, Last Week Tonight, just took me out of it and made me feel like they spent so much on looking authentic the whole movie, only to skimp out on the *one* big explosion VFX that the whole film was centered around. Such a weird choice. 

I really don’t think anyone at all would have minded seeing a really well-made, carefully crafted CGI nuclear explosion in the distance. All the other insert effects shots looked great, loved it, but that one scene really did need, and deserve, more.",2023-07-21 20:15:33
"I loved seeing all the physicist I have read about played by actors! Man, Josh hartnett was a perfect Ernest Lawrence and I loved Benny Safdie as Edward Teller: his accent could have been thicker but would have been harder to understand but eyebrows were the best part. 

I'm a huge science nerd who loves physics, I've even been to a nuclear test site in Nevada (Faultless, 1970, 1MT), I really wanted to see more of the engineering side. They didn't even show the massive factories in Oak Ridge and Hanford. Even though I know it's supposed to be a Oppenheimer biopic. From an engineering standpoint the Manhattan project was one of the biggest success stories.

Also if he didn't use any CG, then how did he set Earth's atmosphere on fire in the last scene? That was CG for sure",2023-07-21 20:30:04
The first 1/3 of the film where he's in Cambridge and learning quantum theory were honestly the most emotionally impactful for me. It really felt sublime with the sound and music. The nuclear explosion itself in comparison was kinda of lame.,2023-07-21 20:43:35

"I went saw both Oppenheimer and Barbie today, and I can’t stop thinking of just how good Oppenheimer was. Barbie lived up to my expectations, but Oppenheimer? Easily one of the best movie experiences of my life. Nolan’s ability to pace a 3 hour movie like this, is phenomenal. Even though I shouldn’t be surprised a Nolan film excelled at everything, I still wasn’t prepared for it!

I love the rare occasion I go into a film expecting a lot, and leave it even more impressed. This was one of those times. Acting, writing, sound, directing ect it’s all perfect. Absolutely perfect.",2023-07-23 04:01:01

"As someone who knew literally nothing about Oppenheimer and very little about the history of Manhattan project, I thought the movie while slow, was alright.

The inevitable bombing scene honestly was a disappointment. I’ve seen the real bomb test video, and the real live footage test video without audio felt much bigger and destructive than what I saw in the movie.

The pacing of the movie shifted the moment RDJ was revealed to be the “villain,” and I was caught off guard since I really didn’t know where the movie was going until that moment. From that moment on, I had to digest what I was watching for the last two hours and connect what happened with who, and I was engaged.

On one hand, if I had read about Oppenheimer’s story and knew about the hearing, I would’ve had more contextual knowledge of what was happening. At the time of screening, I still wasn’t exactly sure what kind of position Lewis Strauss had and what his responsibilities were.

But at the same time, if I had known about it, that “plot twist”/“reveal” that RDJ is the antagonist, wouldn’t have caught me off guard and be engaged connecting the dots.

Also, I wish Nolan played more into the anxiety and fear of the effect the bombs had on the world. That crowd scene and the hearing when he was being pressured to explain why he had such morality change was really chilling and wish we had more.",2023-07-23 15:34:36
"People going to see this for the loud explosions and anticipated suspense that comes with the trinity test, are going to be very disappointed.

While I mostly enjoyed the film, I was expecting this to be a full story about Oppenheimer and Trinity test, it’s more of a story about Strauss (RDJ) and Oppenheimer away from Trinity, than it is about Manhattan project.

People are going to get on Nolan again for making the conversation/dialogue (while better than Batman films) difficult to hear at times, because the films score is significantly louder than the dialog.

Now for the IMAX shots, again not the entire movie is shot in IMAX, a lot of it is, but you can see times when the screen is full (IMAX) and when there’s horizontal bars (not IMAX). The cinematography behind this film is amazing. Really incredible shots, and beautiful imagery.

Matt Damon and RDJ both do a great job in this as well. And Emily Blunt’s role wasn’t great but she saves it toward the end. 

All in all, a very good film, but could have been so much more.  4/5.",2023-07-23 19:35:13

It was a good movie but that's about it. I will say it's the shortest 3 hour movie I've ever watched. It didn't feel 3 hours.",2023-07-23 23:56:33
"Really enjoyed the first two hours of the film, however I thought the 3rd act was a little out of place, I wasn’t familiar with who Strauss was and felt it was hard to follow. So Oppenheimer made him look silly and in turn he got his security clearance revoked for the AEC (I still do not know how important this is) so Strauss gets his comeuppance and fails his hearing to become commerce secretary? To me feels reaaaally inconsequential to ushering in the Atomic age. Debating if I should see it a second time as I was really enjoying it until the final hour where I stayed engaged expecting something to match the magnitude of the test but felt a little let down leaving the cinema to be perfectly honest. Score slaps though 7/10",2023-07-24 21:16:07
this movie was amazing its made me think about a lot since ive seen it. i honestly feel a bit depressed. this movie was devastating and extremely important,2023-07-25 02:19:40
"I personally was not disappointment by the test at all - an incredible flash, a pillar of fire, and an enormous delayed BOOM is pretty much how it went - but Nolan's decision to not have any kind of long-distance shot must have been purposeful, and I'm not sure it was the right one.

The sense of scale wasn't really communicated visually, probably out of a desire to keep the film up close and personal.  If that's his reason, I get it, but I can see how people would be frustrated by the result.  I mean, just *one* long-distance shot could have driven home the enormity of it.  Oh well.",2023-07-25 19:20:09

"I really liked it. I’m not a Nolan fanboy, but I liked the pacing, scattered story, and visuals. 

I didn’t go into it with any expectations, or prior knowledge of what it was going to be about other than ‘Oppenheimer’, so I didn’t force disappointment on myself by expecting it to be purely about a bomb instead of a biopic about a man and his life, like a lot of commenters here seem to have done.",2023-07-26 07:35:41
"I didn’t think this was a good movie until I left and started reading other people online completely whiff underatanding the entire film by trying to suss out “here’s what Christopher Nolan is trying to tell is about the cowardice of neutrality..” or “see! This is a movie about how evil and self centered those scientists were!”.

&#x200B;

Like I don’t know what IQ bracket you have to be in to assume that everything has either a right or wrong “message” to it and if it doesn’t it’s just because you havent watched enough “Oppenheimer ending EXPLAINED” YouTube videos. This is a biography that is often directly quoting (though sometimes paraphrasing) what each of these people said during  these moments in history. Sometimes people are hypocritical or hold two views that shouldn’t mesh together but do. Sometimes people have complex thoughts on things that can’t be easily described or put into words. As Oppenheimer says during the first 20 or so minutes it’s paradoxical… but it’s also true.",2023-07-26 12:05:00
"Loved the film. I think the final third could have been edited slightly better or even shortened.

But goodness me, when the bomb went off in Trinity, it felt like the entire theatre just held their breath. The feet stomping in the victory speech as well. Absolutely haunting stuff.

Oppenheimer's final security clearance hearing scene. The build up as Jason Clarke's character keeps grilling Oppenheimer. It was like Oppenheimer was the bomb itself and was about to explode.

And not to mention, that final scene with Einstein. I think a lot of people already realize the threat of nuclear weapons, but I think that scene emphasises it more that at any time, all our lives could be gone just from a single push of a button.

I've also seen some people mentioning that the size of the Trinity Test explosion was small, but I don't think that was the point of the scene. The point was that Oppie and everyone at Trinity started the chain reaction that Einstein and Oppie were talking about. That the path to the end of our world has started and may only escalate until our end. That. That scene was hauntingly beautiful.

I do wish that the film focused more on Trinity and the bomb. But I agree that the security hearings were as important as the bomb.

I will watch it again.",2023-07-27 23:56:45
"I haven’t seen this discussed and not sure what it means but I wanted to point it out. In the beginning of the film, after he poisons his teacher’s apple, he is lying in bed. He has a flash of a woman feeding a horse an apple, I believe this to be his future wife Kitty. He then realized what he had done and goes to get rid of the apple. When he does so, he grabs it and says “worm hole.” I feel like Nolan is having fun here with time, as if he saw a wormhole to his future life which would have never happened if he had ended up poisoning someone.",2023-07-29 14:01:21
One of my favorite aspects was how Nolan used the abstract visuals to get down to the scale of atoms and make them seem huge. Might go see it again before the imax run ends.,2023-07-29 14:38:02
"Not sure if I heard it correctly, but when Kitty asked Oppenheimer if it’s beginning already, he said, “Keep the sheets in.” right? And then when they lost the trial and called Kitty, he said the same thing right?",2023-07-30 13:05:43
"So, I saw it a week ago with my mom. And I will forever be gratefull of her for pulling up an email with two IMAX 70mm tickets at the London Science Museum. I straight up did a Mia Goth smile when she did that. Thanks, mom.

I don't think I've ever been more giddy for something than this. My energy in the minutes leading up was quite high. My mom was a little surprised over this.

Oh, and she got seats in the middle of *the second row*. Quite an experience. With this out of the way...

The entire Trinity Test had me speechless. Just speechless. It was possibly the most intense scene I've seen in a theater. And then it detonates. I was in awe over the entire section of the movie.

Is it because the whole movie is 70mm unlike the rest of them?",2023-08-11 16:39:31

"I’m gonna write out a full in depth review tomorrow but holy shit. Christopher Nolan gets a lot of schtick from movie snobs for making movies without subtext for the mainstream, but this was legit a movie only he could have pulled off. He took quite possibly the greatest and worst event in human history and turned it into a digestible and compelling story that is equal parts personal and grand in scale. Yeah some directors may have better dialogue or cinematography or nuance but no one but Nolan can take something so much bigger than us and make it *for* us the way he can.

Side note, I love how RDJ - after basically making comical amounts money by just walking on set and acting like himself in MCU movies - can just casually drop one of the performances of the year by just being himself still somehow…",2023-07-21 06:48:05
"Beyond anything else, this move put you in his shoes and made you feel the weight of what was happening. How can anyone argue that this was anything less than the most important moment in the history of mankind?

Smart people in movies often do not feel like real people but everything about this one rang true. Yea he was kinda a bad guy in his personal life. Yea, he questioned his loyalty to his country, who would not under the circumstances? It would be irresponsible not to. The neutrality with which this film approached the political dynamics at play was really refreshing. America is not a shining force for good here, there is a hefty dose of reality.
Like Einstein said, if this thing can destroy the world, you would have to tell the Nazis. 


And then that chilling final scene. Yea the world is still here, but for how long?",2023-07-21 06:55:52

"What a heavy movie to digest. I can’t help but think to the opening scenes of the movie where we see Oppenheimer alone having panic attacks at night. I would like to think that’s how his living days were after the war and subsequent surveillance on his life. Having Einstein in the movie as his genius contemporary, being one of the rare individual of genius in a room full of geniuses who fully understands the dread and living with the burden of not just being one of the greatest minds of our generation but having to deal with the consequences of our inventions, despite our personal moral convictions to do what we believe in, at the cost eliminating the enemy of your greatest threat - the same people who you helped",2023-07-22 13:37:05

"Can someone please answer this timeline question for me:

The ending scene where Oppenheimer talks to Einstein about the chain reaction calculations — that implies that this was AFTER the trinity test correct? Because Oppie asked him about that back when they were developing the atom bomb. 

But what’s confusing to me is that.. if that’s the case.. why is this the same scene where RDJ meets Oppie for the first time..?",2023-07-22 18:29:18
"It was definitely a movie that needed enough information of what actually have happened to understand what was going on. If you don't know nearly anything for Oppenheimer's life ( like I did), then maybe you will not get too much into the movie. Maybe you can't expect different  from a biographic move but I had the feeling that considering that was a Nolan movie, and was highly anticipated, it didn't had to go that much into details. Also most of the dialogues were very fast paced and a little hard to follow for someone who is not American.",2023-07-22 20:01:55

Way better than Tenet though. Everyone acted the fuck out of their roles. The last hour could've been a bit shorter.  Great visuals as expected from a Nolan movie. Background score was a bit too much at times, basically runs for like 90% of the movie i think. Overall still a solid movie. Nolan still has that strong pull on the theater audience. IMAX screens in LA are mostly booked out for like next 2-3weeks.",2023-07-23 02:25:03
"It may not be my personal favorite among Nolan's catalog of films, but this is certainly the most complete film and feels like a culmination of everything Nolan has done.

"While not my favorite Nolan film, you still get an eye-opening look at the creation of the nuclear bomb, the events leading up to it, and the person behind it. Overall the highlight for me had to be the execution of the first explosion - the dead silence as you first see it, then the loud, booming sound effects coming in, all synced to everyone's anxious, horrified reactions, were incredibly powerful. The marbles symbolizing both the passage of time by steadily increasing the amount of uranium and plutonium for the bombs was such a great choice, and reminded me so much of Inception.",2023-07-23 23:02:55
"I thought it was pretty good, the cinematography and camera work were very impressive. I was a little disappointed with the pacing at the start but im glad it buffed out after the trinity test.

 As an IR and stem major I could kind of follow along with what was being said but there were things that went over my head. Definitely worth a watch  notheless, the cast did a pretty decent job and the locations were  beautiful. 

I give a 9.5/10

"70mm imax was glorious. I feel the macro full screen shots of the trinity test's fire and sparks could have plyed for 5 minutes in silence and i would have just lapped it up. So beautiful. 

Amazing set of performances. Obviously Murphy and RDJ were amazing, but I feel like not enough people are talking about Emily blunt! 


Unfortunately only saw about 2.5 hrs of the movie. 
Our projector died just after RDJ had finished lying his trap and was walking out of a house telling Oppenheimer he cant protect him. Video cut to black (quite exciting at first)",2023-07-24 08:30:26
"I went in with limited expectations and was very impressed overall.  However, it went way deeper into the postwar issues with Oppenheimer than I thought it would.  It really felt like the central conflict was about Oppenheimer's security clearance, led by a corrupt political machine (ie Mr. Smith Goes to Washington), which just isn't that interesting if you know the actual story going in.  7.5/10",2023-07-24 15:42:47
"I liked this a lot, it's as entertaining as an accurate biopic of anyone can be. The Strauss ""twist"" didn't work for me as I already knew about it, it probably hits harder if it's a surprise I guess. If I were to nit-pick I'd say there should have been more about Oppie and his relationship with his brother, his early travels in Europe (especially his exposure to Proust), his reputation for being a hugely charming man with a physically imposing manner who could convince anyone to do anything. I also think that the ending missed a trick in not emphasizing how physically and mentally messed up he was after the interrogations he was put through. But that's just nitpicking, it's hard to get everything onto the screen in 3 hours and make it entertaining. This was pretty good, I ignored the hype as much as I could and came out happy after watching it. The build up to the bomb test was very good but I'm pretty sure they had the probability of a runaway chain reaction igniting the atmosphere down to a perfect 0% way before the testing began. The musical score owes a hell of a lot to There Will be Blood. It's not a masterpiece but it's well put together. The acting is fine. 7/10 For anyone who loves this movie and wants more I'd recommend American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin which is a 2005 book of investigative journalism into Oppenheimer's life that reads like a thriller and paints a beautiful and sensitive and informative picture of his life and struggles.",2023-07-24 15:59:02
"first half of the movie felt incredibly difficult to keep track of, especially given how muddled the dialogue was (i can't hear without my subtitles!), but the second half had me encapsulated until the end

"This movie was fantastic...however throughout some of the cuts the explosion cuts are like super loud, which is fine..but damn nolan don't make me too deaf. I'm a little mixed on the explosion sounds. I love it at times but I was also kinda annoyed by it a little.

Another thing I wanted to point out that Ludwig Gorrannson has done an ok score, but it felt a bit too similar to Tenet. He should have gone on a more John Williams, Alan Silvestri, Howard shore route using no electronic music.  The violin that his wife did for him was amazing, that being said, If this film was going to take place somewhere between 1920 - 1960, probably make the music less electronic, and more different? I feel like Nolan loves that slow brass mass music that David Julyan and Hans Zimmer have given him in the past he just told Ludwig, to make it like what my composers Hans Zimmer or David Julyan would have done. Oppenheimers theme was great and all, but it was super overused over and over and over.

The film was also Dialogue heavy, and I loved that. That being said at times, my family who were next to me felt it was hard to understand what the characters were talking about or what the scientists were talking about, but that was only for like 35% of the film. So I am pretty mixed to positive on that one.

Overall this was a 10/10 movie.",2023-07-28 21:44:47

"Enjoyed it, not my favourite of Nolan and could have benefitted from a trim, but feel I'll enjoy it more on a repeat viewing sometime. Interesting in trying to balance Oppenheimer's political stance, his ambition as a scientist and 'the call of duty' against Hitler, so to speak, without being black and white or reducing things to goodies and baddies too much. Jason Clarke's character seemed a little overzealous in the context of what they were doing, but hey, maybe the guy was like that in real life.",2023-07-30 15:59:38

"I just saw Oppenheimer for the first time last night and am still processing much of it. Of course with National Cinema Day, $4 tickets can't be passed up.

I bought the two tickets for a friend and I on Saturday evening and made mental plans to watch some Nolan film Sunday morning or afternoon. I ended up deciding on Memento. I haven't watched this film in several years so it felt very fresh. The bold but super innovative choice to tell a story in both chronological and unchronological order and so successfully has not been matched. Like most prominent directors, Nolan is a storyteller first and foremost. He seems to have a mind that wants to experiment with *how* to tell a story. The possibilities are endless.

Re-watching Memento primed me for Oppenheimer. My mind was ready and open to receive new information. Still, I was not prepared for the overwhelming cascade of the abrupt new visual, audio, and waterfall of emotions throughout. It's only been twelve hours but I'm still unpacking...

"" com·part·men·tal·ize ""

That word reappears multiple times.

I think I remember it being mentioned at least three times but the third time it was used I vaguely recollect that it may have been a joke? Comic relief? It's may be negligible but there are apparently more than several moments of comic relief throughout, as I'm learning while reading others' discussions. RDJ had few, of course :), but wow, he played that villain well. Shoulda seen that shift coming but when it did happen, my god... Modern evil personified.",2023-08-28 16:52:02

"I loved it, it isn’t the action packed or CGI atomic bomb movie alot of people where expecting but instead it was a great story with great character development.

I liked the tone and setting of the movie how depressing the whole process was as soon as the project started. The first half makes you feel excited about whats to come, and then the second half of the movie kicks you back into reality and shows you how an ‘idea’ can be terrible, even for science. 

The consequentes will crush your spirit and will make you lose hope in humanity.

You don't really care about the characters or the events.

The people who compared it to The social network hit on the nail. The final act is a whole courtroom drama. Can understand why some people were disappointed with last 45 minutes. But man no one is giving the dialogues the credit it deserves here. It was like Nolan brought out his inner Aaron Sorkins with this film.

"I really liked the film. The comments I've seen about not caring about the Strauss and Oppenheimer dynamic don't make sense to me. The whole point of the story seems to be the development of god-like destructive power against a backdrop of unjustified human belligerence, be it genocidal (like Germany) or petty (like Strauss). Strauss's grudge was *unimportant* yet he and other humans like him (and like all of us) are the ones wielding this *important* destructive power. This is directly pointed out when Strauss and others were speculating about what Oppenheimer and Einstein had discussed.",2023-07-22 00:21:49

1. The scene where Oppenheimer lectures in Dutch was kind of a slap in the face as a native Dutch speaker, I couldn't understand a word. Either don't do it, or do it better.
2. The actual explosion -> loved the soundtrack here, but I expected a bit more in the visuals, I don't feel that it lived up to the hype.
3. I see some people discussing the pace of the movie. I loved it, it really gave that feeling of continuously building up to a certain plot point. Kind of mimicking the rush to get the project done.

Otherwise, a really great movie!",2023-07-22 11:03:31

"I just want to say that above all else, this film left me with a deep longing to know more. A yearning to study these abstract concepts that these brilliant scientists navigated with dexterity and genius.

I regretted not taking my education so seriously as I left the theater. I wish I had seen this movie when I was 14 - it would have set me on a course to study physics and quantum mechanics and things that can change the world.

I wonder if any young man or woman is seeing this film and setting a course for magnificent scientific achievement…I hope so.",2023-07-23 05:42:45

"I feel Nolan could have left an hour of this film on the cutting room floor. It was just too much in my opinion and I love movies. But this was a case of grandiose expectations from the director. I didn’t care for the non linearity, I’m watching a biopic with a lot of different eras and shit ton of characters. It would have been nicer to slow it down and let the audience work it out through a normal timeline. He could have still shifted the Einstein scene at the end to make it more powerful. I simply feel the director could have condensed an hour or so of that movie into two 15 minute scenes and made them connect with the plot much better. It seemed so excessive. I didn’t think Matt Damon was a great fit for the role of the General. Something seemed very off about his performance. 

Overall I think this a 6.5 out of 10. Music was fantastic and perhaps the best part but as per usual for CNs work it was mixed so terribly it was hard to hear any dialogue or any other background noise.",2023-07-23 14:42:43
"Why isn't anyone talking about the scene where Oppenheimer convinces everyone that they should still go ahead with the bomb even though Germany has been defeated?

Deeply insidious scene from him",2023-07-23 15:57:03
"Just watched for a second time in 70mm.  I think it's alot better the second watch.

I'd say the biggest weakness of the film is that it's hard to know what story it's trying to tell on the first watch.  And because you go in without that context, it's easy to be confused by what's going on in some of the early scenes.

Once you understand the context, those early scenes flow well and communicate the message clearly.

I think it could have used a title card maybe to explain a few of the basics for first time watchers, like who Strauss was, and some of the time frames for different scenes.  It wouldn't really detract from any of the scenes but would help people understand what's going on.

Very good movie though.  It's easily my favorite from Nolan.  Knowing what I know about the Manhattan Project (from reading Feynman's book), it seems mostly pretty accurate.

I think the people complaining about not showing Hiroshima/Nagasaki are being stupid.  The movie is about how bad nuclear proliferation is and how terrifying nuclear holocaust is, you can't make a spectacle of the deaths of a hundred thousand when thats your message.

Also, I'm personally glad the movie is softer on American communists while portraying the anti-communists much worse.  I think it's sensible to dislike communists who leaked information to the Soviets, but as Kitty says most communists didn't really support that.  I think it more or less portrays the political situation accurately, with American communists being questionable by sympathetic and the anti-communists as almost lunatics.",2023-07-23 23:17:56
"Honestly I’m still trying to take it all in. This was an incredibly powerful experience, and one I’m thinking about constantly over the last couple of days. This is a movie that makes me want to pull out all the cliches when it comes to describing a truly great film. Tour de force, cinematic masterpiece etc etc. The writing, acting, directing, pacing, music - it all just comes together perfectly. 

That scene in the auditorium after Hiroshima, with Oppenheimer addressing the crowd, might be the best thing Nolan has ever put together. The final scene with Einstein gave me chills. And there’s so many scenes both little and small in between that blew me away. Can’t wait to watch it again.

Also, for a 3 hour movie this seemed to absolutely *fly* by. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that way in a movie this long before. It was that compelling.

Another thing of note…this is a very raw, emotional and human movie in a way that Nolan’s films usually aren’t.",2023-07-24 05:15:27
"The trinity test scene was something else. The absolute silence and eventually the lines from Oppenheimer immediately followed by the blast was so powerful and something I’ve never experienced in a cinema.

Also never experienced such a impressive ending in a movie, the buildup with the music and the lines are just amazing.",2023-07-24 06:12:57
"I can't believe it was 3 hours. It felt like 2 and a half, if that. I absolutely loved it. I suspect I will appreciate it even more on a second viewing.

My only main gripe was the test itself. I just don't think they managed to convey the immense power of the bomb. The scene leading up to it was extremely tense and done so well and then the detonation itself was a step down. I know Nolan wanted it all practical, but I think that scene would have benefitted from some hybrid CGI or something. Just a little. The real test footage looks so much more terrifying.",2023-07-24 13:40:44
"SPOILER !!!




I agree with another comment here, the Lewis Strauss storyline was not as engaging. The last bit of this film could've benefited more from the moral dilemma scenes. I felt they should have sat in them a bit longer (same with the scene where Oppenheimer was mourning Jean). 

The Trinity test is worth the price of admission alone though! HOWEVER....I felt that the actual explosion/mushroom cloud was lacking. I know he's anti-CGI for this film but I felt it could've benefited from it. Even just a touch up. Still, the entire sequence is one of the best movies experiences I've ever had.",2023-07-24 20:36:34
"One thing I always expect from Christopher Nolan movies is the good old-fashioned visual spectacle achieved through practical effects. While some may not care about it, for me, the use of practical effects adds a sense of wonder that CGI often struggles to achieve. Remember Batman flipping a truck in Downtown Gotham, or the gravity-defying fight scene in Inception, where an old movie trick was utilized?

When I heard that Nolan would recreate the Trinity test using practical effects, I couldn't wait to experience the awe and terror of that on the biggest screen available to me. The build-up to the detonation scene was fantastic, with the initial silent flash followed by the actual explosion. It appeared as a good movie explosion, but it lacked the uniqueness I was hoping for – resembling more of a common gasoline explosion or a fast fire rather than the awe-inspiring footage we've seen of the real Trinity test.

The snippets shown in the trailer of the fireball expanding and hitting the desert were missing from the actual scene, only appearing as brief flashes earlier in the movie. Trinity, being the centerpiece of the film, left me feeling somewhat disappointed compared to the impact of real footage. I had anticipated a little more movie magic to simulate the sheer power of an atomic bomb.",2023-07-24 21:05:03
"Unpopular opinion, movie was meh. So many opportunities to be great, but to me was overhyped for what it was. 

You have one of the most interesting topics in the history of the world, an amazing cast, endless budget, and we get 3 hours of mostly closeup dialogue?

Bomb scene was great as was the speech to the frenzied audience. wish they had put more effort into the rest of the movie or cut it by an hour. Seemed like a lazy River of a movie to me. 

Everyone else seems to like it though, so what do I know",2023-07-25 14:06:48
"First, I thoroughly enjoy Nolan films. Interstellar is one of my all-time favorites, as is Dark Knight like many people. But sometimes he misses, like Tenet. Tenet was just okay, really. Nothing wrong with it, it's just an okay film. I think Oppenheimer is in that same group.

I was really hoping it was going to focus more on the Manhattan Project, and some of the lives lost during the creation of the bomb itself. I thought the detonation was a letdown, especially when compared to the actual footage of the Trinity Test. The questioning was focused too much on whether Oppy was affiliated with the Communist Party and I think many parts could have been left out or at least shortened up a bit. Honestly, there were moments where I was just plain bored. 

All that being said, the actor's performances were top notch. Everyone crushed it, and it was refreshing to see RDJ in a drama again where he can really flex his skills. Cillian was on-point. That man can say so much with just his face, especially his eyes, it's incredible. 

Would I recommend this one? Yes, I would never discourage someone from seeing the film. Watch it and see what you think. I think this one just isn't for me, like Tenet wasn't for me. Nothing wrong with it, maybe a little long, but just okay.",2023-07-26 03:24:51
"A movie like this, this long, I have too much to say. More than you’re likely willing to read.

One of those movies that makes you sit back afterwards and feel humbled that we get to consume entertainment at this level. 

Nolan’s jumpy storyboard works a lot better for nonfiction recounting than it does for fictional stories, particularly with the historical context. This was a *very* non-linear movie, yet I found it very easy to follow given it’s ties to real events. I’d like to see Nolan go down this path some more. 

I have a biology degree with minors in chemistry and physics. Hearing names like Fermi and Heisenberg and Bohr spark memories for me, and part of the reason this film is so great to me is the directorial skill executed on both historically important and scientifically fascinating subject matter. With that said, I can see 80% of my friends being so lost and confused that they would leave the theater halfway through. This was much less approachable than Interstellar in that way, but I’m thrilled to have seen it nonetheless. It felt like a little masterpiece made just for me.",2023-07-26 05:44:39
"Haven’t seen a single comment on it yet, but one of the biggest things that stood out to me was the pacing of this movie. From the very first second the film starts it seems like a ticking time bomb up to trinity. What a spectacle. Nolan does NOT miss.",2023-07-30 05:30:26
I finally saw this and it might be my favourite film of the last 10 years. I'm seeing it again next week in IMAX.,2023-07-31 01:19:43
"Just watched the movie. Mesmerizing. I was glued to the screen from start to finish. A mesmerizing performance by Cillian Murphy, the script was tight and the directing/cinematography were also mesmerizing.

I loved most three elements of the film.

First was that they didn't glorify the test atom bomb explosion as could be expected from Nolan's previous works of elaborate action/effects. It was more depicted as an imperfect, wild and untamed force. It was a bit ugly even.

The second was the depiction of the disjointed, irregular and aimless nature of Oppenheimer. (I just lack the vocabulary to explain it.) He was given a goal, an aim, a purpose by general Groves. Before that he was simply highly intelligent, strong-willed and highly energetic person, whose energies he barely contained. Even his Jewish comrades didn't know who he actually was. His whole life was a disjointed mess. It felt like at his core he didn't know who he was. He lacked purpose. I had the impression that the real person Oppenheimer was a deeply disturbed and unhappy man throughout his whole life. Maybe that's false but since this is based on his autobiography, which is considered an accurate and important work, I'm inclined to believe so. Anyone who knows more is welcome to enlighten me.

The final element was the depiction of the political side of the whole ordeal. A group of people in a room made decisions about how many people to die and where. That scene was chilling. I was devastated. The magic of the movie collapsed and I was back in the real world. Damn.

I didn't understand a lot of the political stuff - so many names, parties, etc. I may have to look things up.

Overall, I was left with no words after that brilliant - iconic and beautiful - last shot. No words. Just sat there and looked at the credits and listened to the ominous music. With only a burning furnace of all kinds of emotions in me. I cannot give less than a 10 to this movie. I think that it is Nolan's best movie and perhaps my favorite of his.

\[EDIT: Some nice moments. When Oppenheimer got the apple from Bor's mouth: ""worm holes"". I like how they touched upon the ""feud"" (not sure about the right word) between mathematicians and physicists, which I read upon recently. As a lay person I found those two funny.\]",2023-08-02 20:39:51
"I loved the movie but call me an idiot... I really didn't understand the beef between Strauss and Oppenheimer, as well as the reasoning for the US to question Oppy so much.",2023-08-04 15:12:26
"Chiming in after seeing Opp last night. My history with Nolan is mostly positive and slightly complicated. His editing choices have often felt too fast and choppy to me, but that can sometimes serve the movie well and might not bother me. I despised Tenet though, as it was loud, choppy, confusing, and felt like a mess. It was the one that shook my faith that Nolan could continue pumping out blockbuster hits. Now onto Opp...

I really liked it! The score, the cinematography, the acting are all A1 and I have no complaints. Seriously, the cast is stacked here, and it was awesome to see Robert Downing Jr in a role outside of Marvel again. And a Sadfe brother? Rami Malek?! I was obviously having a blast with the cameos. My favorite scenes are the Trinity test, the security clearance scene where they show him feeling exposed and naked, and Opp's speech after the Hiroshima bombing. 

And while I thought that speech scene was a fantastic way of expressing the duality of the situation (you've accomplished a scientific breakthrough but it's now been used to extinguish thousands of lives), I wanted more of that. After that speech, the remaining act seems to alienate us from Opp, choosing to instead go for twisty reveals by withholding information from the audience. While I think that fits well in this movie, a fast-paced and what seems to be a strict retelling/showcasing of events, I still find myself struggling with the fact that we lose that emotional core by moving away from Opp's internal struggle. 

Early on in the movie, Nolan shows Opp having visions of dread in some really fascinating ways as he hones in on quantum mechanics and it's uncertainty. Like having him in bed, visualizing the atoms spinning at unfathomable speeds and later envisioning stars swallowing themselves infinitely. And later, after his speech, with the background warbling and seeing the audience distort into radioactive aftermath. I would have loved to see that visual design carried into the third act more, having these visions become more grotesque and surreal as he grapples with his participation in the creation of this frighteningly destructive and otherworldly weapon. Those visions are still there and I think they work when they're on screen, but what I really wanted from the movie after that Trinity scene was to spend more time with Opp's psyche and less time with senators. Film could be the best medium to explore that emotional and mental conflict, so it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. 

Overall, I thought this was a great time though and yet another movie from this year I would recommend to almost any avid moviegoer. The editing and focus can be strange (felt like we were getting barraged with 1 minute vignettes every once in a while), but there's still some very impressive filmmaking and composition here that we'll be thinking about long after seeing it. 

3.5/5 ⭐️",2023-08-05 12:08:49
"Loved it overall, the auditorium speech (the deafening stomping, the crying couple and his student throwing up… the feeling of dread was enormous) and the ending scene were all big standouts and haunting as hell. Great great movie, huge rebound from Tenet. It was mostly just dudes in rooms talking but I had this dread throughout the entire thing and it was really well shot and edited, didn’t feel 3 hours long and held the entire theatre’s attention the whole time. Liked seeing RDJ being able to show some chops at the end too even if they did make Strauss almost cartoonishly villainous at points. Also had no idea Casey affleck was in this but his scene was one of the creepiest and more unnerving parts of the movie, can’t imagine how scary it’d be being around one of those wackjob CIA types that could just end you whenever they wanted. 

And the sound for the big bomb not kicking in at first was great, made a person in my theatre scream for their fucking life when it finally happened lmfao",2023-08-07 02:32:43
"I think this movie was perfect example of how not to tell a story. There were three good stories here and none of them really got told. The three stories that could have been told were: The challenges of making the bomb (but I get that, it was done really well in Fat Man and Little Boy), the story about the conflict between the general and Oppenheimer over the need for secrecy while working on the project, the story of who leaked the information to the Russians and how they turned on eachother which resulted in Oppenheimer being hung out to dry.  They kinda touched on that last theme but not really because we really didn't see how it impacted Oppenheimer emotionally or practically. Everything appeared to take place behind closed doors and it was just rather boring as it was portrayed as insignificant.",2023-08-07 15:46:56
"I’m going to need to watch this again with subtitles. I felt the trial scene was very drawn out, and (possibly unpopular opinion) you don’t necessarily need to watch this in IMAX. Yes, the couple scenes with explosions were stunning, but I think this film had far fewer visual effects than most Nolan films that make an IMAX viewing worth it. But I still enjoyed the film! 6.5/10",2023-08-08 01:15:08
My gf didnt like it and I want to die. I was so moved by it.,2023-08-09 04:05:35
I saw it on Tuesday in one of the best theaters in the nation in full IMAX and I'm frustrated by how good some aspects were while others were not.  I don't have the time to get into everything but I can't believe how simple some of the writing is.  And my biggest issue with the movie more than anything else was that the constant swapping from IMAX to letterbox just seemed so arbitrary.  There seemed to be no reason why we'd establish a shot of Oppe and Einstein in IMAX for one second and then simply cut to another angle and it's no longer IMAX.  Just film the whole damn movie in IMAX and make it beautiful or if you can't then come up with some kind of artistic decision around which shots are IMAX and which ones are not.  Even something as simple as exteriors are IMAX and interiors are regular.  Or something more interesting like a certain character is larger than life and is shot in IMAX while other side stories are not.  But the randomness of it was frustrating and it seemed they didn't even attempt to keep a constant color temperature between different shots in the same scene.  Just like Avatar 2 with the flipping from 48 fps to 24 fps doubled back and forth this was a massive distraction and would love to hear it defended or explained to me.,2023-08-10 21:44:20
"It’s really good. But me and both of my friends agreed it would not have suffered by being trimmed by about a half hour. By the third act we were so mentally exhausted by the constant barrage of sweeping orchestral music laid over casual conversation that we were getting headaches.

But yeah, amazing performances all around. Beautifully shot and edited. Score was good just WAY too loud in a lot of places.

I saw it in 70mm true imax (not that liemax crap) and it was a stellar experience, but the movie is 100% too long. I understand and appreciate how big this story is and how much they fit into that three hours, but the last 30 minutes were a bit of a struggle for me. Not because of the quality of the film, but simply because it was over 2.5 hours of staring at a screen and being assaulted mentally. I was actively ready for it to end. That entire investigative hearing could have been trimmed down to just a couple of minutes and gotten the exact same point across. IMO, the movie should have cut back to the conversation with Einstein by the pond right after the scene where Oppie delivers the victory speech to the cheering crowd and starts hallucinating then ended.

Would have landed just as hard. 

RDJ was amazing but I was just starting to clock out mentally that far into the runtime. 

Overall 8/10 though.",2023-08-14 13:26:08

"amazing actors, amazing visuals - as always with nolan.
unnecessary convoluted editing/structure, wooden dialog that leans too heavy into explaining stuff - unfortunaly, it was too much for me, didnt click.
also - i HATED the soundtrack.. no themes, just violin noise terror and stock rythmn - especially in the bomb scene man..",2023-12-10 19:19:49
"Chris Nolan seems to be under the impression that a constant barrage/supply of information that the viewers have to follow like holding a slinky tied to a jet ski makes for a good drama, and it's always been his issue from the very beginning. Characters explaining things to each other in the most ham-fisted, obvious ways, the constant exposition dump that every single one of his movies suffer from. It also doesn't help that Nolan decided to frame the entire movie on one of the least interesting aspects of Oppenheimer's life - that he had some communist ties and that doesnt clear his security clearance. Like who gives a flying donut fuckhole, and no one in the movie really does apart from Strauss who is only using that bit of information to bring Oppie down cause he made him look bad a bit in the past, it's so lame. Like seriously, why the fuck is Strauss such a big part of this movie? Also RDJ did fine but he does not deserve the award hype he is getting. 

  
Also somehow the titular character of Oppenheimer is completely undercooked, there is not enough focus on his moral quandary between the pragmatic aspects of the development of the bomb versus the guilt. Theres plenty of the movie telling us that he should be conflicted, but we barely get to see his inner turmoil through action apart from some cheesy fantasy sequences where they emulate the nuke effect from his pov, like I fucking started laughing when that lady's skin started coming off with its shitty makeup effect. Also Oppie is written to be such an indecisive, spineless bitch - he constantly cheats and cries about it, he's totally for the trinity project until he sees some newsreel footage of the devastating effects of the bomb on the Japanese and then he finally feels bad, like what the fuck did you think would happen Oppie? When Truman scene came on I wished Gary Oldman slapped the shit out of him. Overall, a pretty disappointing lengthy film that definitely has its good parts but I feel like it's one of Chris Nolan's weakest.",2024-01-12 23:50:08
This movie is still amazing when you don’t have people yelling about how “long and overrated” it is. It’s a little difficult to sit through for 3 hours but it doesn’t have any actual filler scenes. And people saying it’s glorifying the bombings really miss the entire point of it lmao. Overall it’s one of the most engaging and thoughtful movies I’ve ever seen.,2024-03-12 15:52:23
"Like, I understand Nolan is all about making cerebral movies but being bombarded with nonstop back-and-forth dialogue which you can't afford to miss is not my idea of an enjoyable movie. It's Nolan on Coke.",2024-03-25 10:04:09
"Really disliked it, style over substance. Florence Pugh with simultaneously the most interesting sketch of a character and one of the most laughable moments I've ever seen in a ""best picture"" with the Bhagavad Gita. No reason for the length. In comparison, Killers of the Flower Moon flew by and was actually interested in telling a story. Awful sound mixing and score, well, maybe not awful but just downright exhausting, drowning every moment of impact when it should have been adding to it. No interest in coherent scenes or structure.  Baffled by the positive reception for such an interesting story with such an interesting assembly of historical figures to be completely butchered, it felt like a film student's experiment.",2024-01-27 14:07:13
"Maybe I just wasn’t paying attention to the marketing but the entire movie I was going “Wait is that Dane DeHaan? Is that Josh Peck?? Is that Jack Quaid??? Alden Ehrenreich??? Rami Malek????”

I know there was a review that said the sound mixing was a lot better than before in regards to understanding the dialogue, maybe it’s cos the characters spoke fast or my hearing sucks but I honestly only heard and understood the dialogue like 70% of the time. Sucks because people are saying it’s his best script yet and I wish I could understand all of it

I’m not familiar with the history of Jean Tatlock so maybe I missed it but were there quick cuts of her death, one of them showing a hand drowning her? Was she killed or did she commit suicide?

I like RDJ but I genuinely wasn’t expecting him to be that good in this movie. He killed it, and being unfamiliar with the history I was genuinely surprised with the twist. Knowing it now his reaction to his humiliation was really well done

I must be a child because I genuinely couldn’t stop giggling when “I am become death” was first said during the sex scene of all things. You could also feel the audience cringe when Blunt looked into Pugh’s eyes in that one scene

Speaking of, the pure silence during the trinity test was wonderful. You could feel everyone being in awe of the visuals. I braced myself for the inevitable sound jumpscare but it still got me

Overall this was a great movie. Wonderful performances and haunting ending. Can’t wait to watch it again (hopefully with English subs this time lol)",2023-07-21 04:50:58

"The movie was spectacular on technical level. I think I went in with too high of expectations. I really felt like there was no need for this movie to be Imax. Not saying what they showed wasn't well done but it tempered my experience. Felt like I was on waiting mode for most of the movie, especially with how they teased Imax scene showing waves and molecules. I would've loved it if they replaced the political focus of the movie to exploring the making of bomb and deeper into oppenohimself. Overall good watch but couldve been better Imo. I need sit with the movie and I think knowing what type of movie it is now, I'll probably appreciate it more on second watch.",2023-07-22 02:42:21

"I feel like this movie was trying to be everything to everyone and ended up being spread so thin that it couldn't say anything. It didn't have time to say much about Oppenheimer's politics, his mental health struggles, stances on nuclear weapons, McCarthyism.... But it sure did want to touch on all of them.

The closest this came to having a theme was the hurt Oppenheimer put people though but even that was spread among like 15 different characters. Pugh is in, what, 10 minutes max out of a 185 minute movie? Strauss is the emotional climax of the movie but he's absent for most of the middle 2/3s. His relationships with Tellis and Lawrence were fascinating and had some amazing performances but they were crammed in with so much other stuff that they felt crammed in.

There's a tremendous amount of fluff that just goes nowhere, for example Robert's brother really didn't need to be in this nor did the first half hour of the movie.",2023-07-23 13:06:06

On the other hand barbie failed to tie all of its sub plots together to bring about a convincing solution for the conflict setup in the first half of the movie. Added to that, the ideas and writing became sloppy and too lazy in the end, which was not helped with the open ending climax.

"The scene in the room with the bleachers was so chilling and I think the stand out moment from the film.

My only critique of the movie is I feel like they were a bit indulgent with showing off Florence Pugh’s body. 

It made sense in the scene where Oppe is being questioned and we visually see him being naked and vulnerable along with his wife’s reaction to hearing him document his affair. 

It just felt like they reduced her character into a sex object instead of a full person.",2023-07-21 16:16:58
"I wanted to love this but I'd say there was about 30 mins of brilliance and the rest left me pretty cold.

There wasn't enough build up with Straus to make the ""reveal"" have any real heft and more generally I didn't feel the stakes of the courtroom stuff considering all the time that was dedicated to it - or indeed any emotional investment into the potential consequences. The jumping between timelines or even just rapid cuts in the same timeline in the third act were tedious at times.

For me, there was so much potential in there for something that was a more straightforward character study of the weight on Oppenheimer's shoulders and the dissonance of being responsible for this terrible and brilliant thing - the bits where they did explore this were the best for me. 

The romances felt really hurried and unnatural to me too....

For very different reasons it reminded me of watching Thor: Love & Thunder where I felt I had reached saturation point with some of Taika Waititi's worst qualities - this really laid bare some of Nolan's for me.",2023-07-21 19:02:38

"This movie is like caviar. I recognize what I'm consuming is quality. Well made, well crafted, well prepared, but I don't love it. 

I love Christopher Nolan, but much like Dunkirk, I find Oppenheimer an incredibly well made movie that's not for me. 

The performances are incredible across the board. This film might have one of the most stacked casts of all time. Seriously, there's so many scenes where a well established actor shows up for what could have been an extra. That aspect is awesome. Cillian Murphy may have just solidified that's he's one of the best actors of this generation.

However, the three hour runtime, occasional forced dialogue, and the fact the movie peaks in the middle, really hurt it for me. The last hour felt like a slog. 

If you like movies like The Ides of March, Charlie Wilson's War, and All The President's Men, I'd highly recommend it.",2023-07-22 05:15:00
"The trinity test was very underwhelming, it was very obvious that instead of seeing a nuke going off miles away we saw a large conventional gas explosion going off a hundred feet away. The decision to go all practical really harmed the impact it could've had. The explosion didn't have any debris being thrown into the air around the base because you can't do that practically without even more obviously giving away the small scale of the explosion (could've at least used VFX to add it in). It was pure fireball in the gasoline mushroom cloud vs a real nuke that pulls up so much of the earth below it into the air.",2023-07-22 08:06:38

"I am a massive Christopher Nolan fan, just saw the movie, a masterpiece indeed, I just wish they spent more time on the science part and building the bomb and cut some of the political stuff at the end, I just couldn't empathize too much with Oppenheimer at the end, all his punishment was to revoke his security clearance? They made it appear that he got exiled or tortured for 30 years in an underground dungeon. It would have been better to focus more on the bomb building, the climax happened too early in the movie. Nevertheless, a solid 9/10 movie, we are lucky to have Nolan in our lifetime.",2023-07-23 02:43:59
"7.5/10.

I went in with huge expectations but the movie honestly didn't click for me. Sure, it was an excellent movie in terms of filmmaking (the cinematography and score definitely stood out), but I felt like Nolan could have done much more with the plot and dialogue. 

A lot of it played out like a courtroom drama with cheesy dialogue (e.g. the Groves line), and the significance of the >!Strauss ""reveal""!< felt forced. Even Oppenheimer's security clearance getting revoked was not a huge turning point for his character given how much of the screentime and attention it got.

I wonder if the movie would have been better with more of Oppenheimer's interactions with Jean and Kitty to portay his cognitive dissonance.",2023-07-25 03:27:49

"I was a bit disappointed in the story. Every bit of it that was about physics and the Manhattan project and the military and the war was quite enjoyable to me. But that was significantly outweighed by the political drama that surrounded it. To me, the choice to anchor the film in the Strauss hearings was a mistake. Sure, they interrogated Oppie about his misgivings and regrets but we didn’t really get enough of his personal struggle with what he was doing and what he unleashed. IMO the interrogation was a clumsy way to tease that out. Some of my disappointment comes from what I should’ve realized by the title. This was a movie about Oppenheimer the man, first and foremost, and the thing he is most famous for, the Manhattan project is almost glossed over. It’s background. I think that was a mistake in storytelling.",2023-07-26 05:40:08
"Am I the only one who feels underwhelmed with the atomic bomb test?

"We watched this right after Barbie.  So many similar themes that it gave me the shivers.    


The themes: Death.  Men with deep insecurities.  How to deal with change.  Political power.    


My favorite scenes:  
1) Truman felt like he had the burden of responsibility as the man who decided to drop the bomb.  So Truman was super annoyed when Oppie (Oppenheimer) felt like he was responsible as the man who headed the project that created the bomb.   Oppie couldn't even conceive that Truman would feel like the responsible one, otherwise he wouldn't have said it the way that he did.    
\- I'm the martyr!  No, I'm the martyr!    


2) Strauss thought that Oppie said something to Einstein to cause Einstein to ignore Strauss that one time long ago.  In the end it was revealed that Oppie had mentioned again to Einstein the possibility of destroying the planet by burning the atmosphere.  So, Strauss wasn't being discussed, Einstein simply had bigger things on his mind.  Even if this didn't happen exactly, it was so true to human nature.  So many ridiculous rivalries start off as petty misunderstandings or from fear and feelings of insecurity or inadequacy.    


3) When Oppie was crying after Jean Tatlock's death.  All womanizers (including Oppie) do what they do because they are trying to compensate for some inadequacy they feel about themselves.  As someone who was never right for Jean, but indulged himself anyways, he felt some measure of responsibility for her death and that led him to feel responsible for the atomic bomb deaths as well.",2023-08-03 09:17:33
"It was good.

Nice mix of the urgent WW2 efforts with the lingering concern of the future risk, different views on martyrdom (Truman was portrayed as a bloated ass (from Oppies POV of course) but he did give Oppenheimer a reality check) the pragmatic policies mixed with the madness 

Minor annoyances:
* The Strauss plot felt like a forced attempt to repeat the vibe from The Prestige of a personal rivalry, some mysteries sprinkled in as a red thread throughout the film followed by a reveal with flashbacks. (Maybe cause one guy was named Borden 😆) The replaying of the Einstein pond scene and ""Isotopes are more useful than a sandwich"" really reminded me of the flashbacks from Prestige 
* The constant over dramatisation - especially in the beginning. Felt ridiculous to see Robert bored in his dorm room and going to museums to the sound of bombastic strings 
* those abstract graphics (why? trying to say ""he has a beautiful mind""?)
* The usual problem with biopics: so many scenes, they were all fine but many felt non essential. Like camping With Josh Hartnett, the worry over the communist killer, many parties",2023-08-04 00:03:08

"Saw the movie yesterday. I was hoping for a little more on why Oppenheimer opposed the H-Bomb, and less on the trial drama. Slightly disappointing how it turned into a typical drama/thriller with a moustache twirling villain at the end.",2023-08-07 09:09:43
"I really enjoyed the movie! Sure, the female characters are underwritten, but no more so than most of the male supporting cast. I thought it was actually quite well paced, I didn't feel like I was sitting in a chair for 3 hours, the story kept it's momentum.

I think my only real criticism of character portrayals would be that the first sex scene really didn't need to be a sex scene, he and Jean had an intimate relationship, but they were more of an emotional/intellectual match than a physical one irl, so having that first scene of them together just being a (still intimate) talking scene with their clothes on I think would have been more representative of the real people. On a similar note, I think one of the sex scenes should've been with his wife, cuz apparently she had to teach him all about how that stuff goes, but it's possible that Emily Blunt just wasn't up for that. 

I could probably nitpick other things, but overall I thought the movie was really well done, and accomplished what it set out to do. I think the unscreen portrayals of these people were very interesting, and seem to have been mostly accurate.
I really appreciate it then bringing attention to the fact that a lot of these scientists working on the bomb or Jewish, and it was initially intended to be used on the Nazis, not Japan. That's a really important piece of context that I think too often goes overlooked.",2023-08-08 14:56:59
"I couldn't understand half the dialogues. I am not a native English speaker but I haven't had the issue so bad with other films I watched in the same IMAX theatre. I think Nolan's use of non-stop background music during all the dialogues and especially when the dialogue is spoken slowly (hushed tones), makes it completely inaudible. 

Did anyone feel the same?",2023-07-22 03:17:37
"I need to see it again but I can’t stop thinking about that Casey Affleck scene.

Genuinely felt like the Farmer/Hans Landa scene from Inglorious Basterds or the basement scene from Zodiac.

Affleck’s interrogation was tense as fuck and there was a foreboding atmosphere that filled the theater. Masterwork by Nolan.",2023-07-22 09:09:56
"A lot of people saying that Oppenheimer trial was not important and his communist stuff was not needed in the movie. Well let me just say that was indeed the most crucial part. Why? Because the impact of his atom bomb directly effected the cold war which is why communism vs American philosophy in the movie directly defied Oppenheimers later life.

People really thinking that USA dropped the bomb to make Japan surrender are dead wrong. After German's surrender it was only matter of when Japan would surrender. While USA was making their own plan Soviet were on the verge of invading Japan. These made it necessary from USA perspective to make Japan surrender quickly. They also wanted to Russia to see the real strength of their power by dropping the bomb. 

Then when nuke happened and WW2 was over  but the main war between USA and Soviet had just begun. After the world war Soviets got their own bomb and hence the new age of fear and anxiety that world was on verge of being destroyed by two different ideology started for more than 50 years. This is the ultimate war that Oppenheimer had to face. He was facing the challenge of his ideology on one side and his home country in another both of whom had the power the destroy the whole world by his creation. Every thing that happens on the trial is pitting his beliefs and his creation with one another. Without that this is just a movie of bomb which would have been forgotten in a week. 

But the movie focuses more on morality, ideology and creativity which will be discussed on who was wrong and right for years to come. The movie was never about the world war 2 or about the atom bomb but rather it was about consequence of those things to Oppenheimer's life.",2023-07-22 14:48:06
It’s wild how breakneck the pacing of this movie is when 98% is people standing around talking.  Loved it!,2023-07-22 20:51:13

"One of the best films I’ve seen. Got to see it on digital Imax. My whole body was clenching when they began the trinity test and they showed everything in silence and when the sound waves from the bomb swept through the cast, the whole theater shaked, I thought that was a genius move. I loved the color grade (reminded me a bit of Kodachrome ),music and the acting was phenomenal!!!",2023-07-24 23:37:37
"Loved the Film - 9.5/10 (Would be a 10 out of 10 but as always Nolan needs to fire his sound guy, I suspect it's due to the amount of dubbing required due to the use of IMAX camera, the score/sound effects were excellent however.

I really got a sense of the duality of Oppenheimers success becoming his own mutually assured destruction.

This film was never about the bomb, it didn't even really need to be shown, it was the human reaction to the most powerful force ever released, every human 15+ alive knows what an atomic bomb going off looks like.

The presentation (70mm IMAX) was also an experience within itself.

This was a Film, not a movie.",2023-07-25 21:05:51
"Am I correct in that this movie, about 10 minutes in, had a caption on-screen that read

\> 1. Fission

And then no other caption ever appeared on-screen again?

It seemed like it was going to be a storytelling device, like his version of chapters of every stage that occurs during an atomic explosion. But I don't seem to recall any other captions throughout the movie. No captions regarding what year they were in, no captions when they went to another area.

So, as for the movie, I think its three distinct stories occuring in three distinct parts of Oppenheimer's life and they should've been edited so that they mostly stay separate. Sorta like the Aaron Sorkin Steve Jobs movie.

I can't make any sense as why some scenes where in black and white. We even have one scene in which they meet at a lavish round table, and some of those shots are in b&w and later on in the movie they are in color. I don't know if its meant to represent ""flashback"" or ""dishonest recollection"" versus ""present-tense"" and ""truthful depiction.""

The scenes involving Oppenheimer's personal life and personal drama are just not handled well. Nolan simply does not know how to do this type of drama adequately.

I want to compare it with how Damien Chazelle is able to create a logical emotional through-line with Neil Armstrong. Of course, its probably because Chazelle doesn't rush through it like Nolan did here. We have scenes in which Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are riding horses, and then 90 seconds later they're kissing each other with dramatic music like as if we've just witnessed a key pivotal relationship moment. It just doesn't connect. Its flat.

The IMAX 70mm viewing...um, I can't really say that its necessary. There's only one key shot in which its perfectly framed for the aspect ratio. And not only that, I'd say that this movie contains a somewhat noticeable level of film grain. 

Trinity bomb test, I think they spent too much time having the camera on the actors instead of showing us what it really feels like to look at a bomb. I was expecting a shot in which they show the entire area being lit up like its the middle of the day.

Final hour actually gets into a pretty good pace and interesting storyline, except I think the climatic moment doesn't really feel impactful, the movie just gets loud at that moment.

I know its a cop-out to say this, but this should've been a 5-hour HBO miniseries.",2023-07-26 04:54:19
"**7/10**

I have watched this twice. 70mm IMAX and in Dolby Cinema. 

Acting and set/costume design are excellent, however dialogue was drowned out by the stupidly loud soundtrack. This would have worked better as a Nolan miniseries. They crammed too much in 3h, and the editing, flashbacks, and color shift were unnecessary. The Senate hearing and the Security Clearance hearing were overly long, and the Trinity explosion was underwhelming compared to the nuclear-related documentaries I have seen. 

Since I was the only who had read American Prometheus in my group, I think Nolan did a poor job explaining all of these different characters and their motivations. Few people could hear the critical dialogue.

The Prestige and Interstellar and Dark Knight remain Nolan’s best movies imo.",2023-07-30 19:53:31
"Loved it.

As someone who shoots occasionally video and primarily photos, I want to address the comments that say shooting in 70mm was pointless. I think a lot of people would say me shooting in 35mm film today is pointless because, sure, I could get a recipe for Protra 800 or something right? But it's not the same. If I'm shooting something, even if its for a client or a friend or job or whatever, there's still a part of me that's going to do it for selfish reasons, those being that I am a huge fan of using another tool.

And that's what IMAX 70mm essentially is right, it's another tool for him to use. If I had the opportunity Nolan had, I would shoot with that camera as fucking as I fucking could. I like the more full frame look.

I don't agree this didn't need to be 70mm imax. Doesn't need to be a crazy action movie or sprawling cityscape for the justification to be in imax 70mm.",2023-08-04 16:59:44
"I get that the movie is supposed to be about the people behind this historical event, but the unending stream of close-ups of characters' faces (whose ensemble grew exponentially with every scene) made me feel dizzy. It was like watching a giant zoom call most of the time.",2023-08-07 08:55:29
"I watched it with my dad in August 1, but neither of us really knew what to make of it as the overall cinema experience was terrible and we both didn’t really know what it was about other than the guy who made the atomic bomb.

Just rewatched it on my own tonight, and oh my god it is the greatest film of all time. I totally get it, and I absolutely love it. It just so epic.",2023-08-18 21:31:28
"Positives: I really liked how the camera work shows Oppenheimer's isolation(?) with close-ups of his face and Dutch angles. The soundtrack was neat. At moments I felt as if I was watching ""Interstellar"". The Trinity test scene is great. Murphy was really good. Nothing extraordinary, but real solid work. Negatives: the movie was really tiring. When the Strauss twist came about I was just like: ""Huh, alright"". I turned it off around the 2 hours 40 minutes mark and I don't really feel like finishing it. As far as I've heard the ending isn't really that satisfying. And now my biggest problem: it is too long. Most, if not all of the McCarthy stuff could be removed without any detriment to the movie. Also it is a bit of a wasted opportunity. Nolan could've focused primarily on Oppenheimer's guilt instead of politics, but welp. I feel like it could have ended with the gym speech scene, where he sees the audience get vaporised by an atomic blast: the screen fades to pure white and we get the end titles. For me it was 3-4/5.",2023-08-26 00:59:28
"I think the general audience consensus on this will be that it’s kind of a masterpiece, but it drags on for too long after the bomb drops. I saw a lot of people in the theatre checking their phones constantly in the last 30 minutes or so, while at least 3 people actually got up and left the theatre (seemingly) for good. 

I think that this film is like a beautiful puzzle wherein the pieces are laid out slowly one-by-one, until we finally complete the picture that is the atomic bomb at the centre. 

Out of the 14 films I’ve seen in theatres this year, it’s easily the best. The only issue I have is that you need to know a lot about the players involved to really understand the importance of the meetings in the film, which may not be the case for all film-goers. 

I’ll probably go see it again before its IMAX run is finished. It’s a lot to process, but it’s very rare for a movie of that length to keep me engaged like Oppenheimer does. If you aren’t into dialogue-centric movies and you’re expecting heavy hitting action, I’d probably stay away from this one tho.",2023-07-21 13:35:57

"I think the flaws in Nolan's execution can be summarized in the scene where Florence Pugh is riding Cillian, and inexplicably takes a break to go through his books, happens to find a book with sanskript writing, and makes him read it out loud while she rides him again. And what words does he read out loud?

""I am become death, destroyer of worlds."" Lol so goddamn dumb.",2023-07-22 08:52:15
"[Mark Hughes' review is the most accurate, in my opinion.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2023/07/20/critics-review-oppenheimer-is-a-hot-mess/)

The review starts several paragraphs down after some preamble about the box office. Some snippets of quite a lengthy review:

>Oppenheimer is ambitious and includes many mesmerizing, often brilliant moments, but those moments cannot sustain themselves nor find common ground as a single compelling narrative or perspective. Despite seemingly global and even cosmic themes, it winds up feeling decidedly contained and restricted, eyes cast downward, abandoning any visionary search for higher meaning behind the processes of science or politics.

And...

>Not that I just wanted a big CGI nuclear explosion — I understand what this film is meant to be and I know all of the arguments and points made about how and why war and destruction and armageddon shouldn’t be casually treated as entertainment, and why a would-be morality tale shouldn’t glamorize or glorify nuclear holocaust as an “achievement.” But the moment, including actual restored and enhanced footage, could and should easily convey the dread and large-scale impression of absolute extinction — and the reactions of Oppenheimer and others witnessing it — can add to these themes (the film includes a few nods in this direction post-test, just not as much as I expected). This is the central moment of Oppenheimer’s life, it’s why we speak his name today and why this movie exists and why his warning reverberate. So I just feel it should’ve been a more central moment in the film, instead of getting less screen time than and roughly equal emotional representation as his love life.

And this just sums it up for me most accurately;

>I am a huge fan of Nolan’s work, regardless of whatever criticisms I’ve offered over the years. I fully expected Oppenheimer to blow me away and be one of my favorite films of the year. I imagined it would be on my top 10 list for 2023 and one of the primary contenders on my list of Best Picture nominees. Instead, I’m disappointed and would have a tough time sitting through Oppenheimer again.

My general feeling is that Nolan is much better at Inception / Interstellar style films, and this would have been handled much better by someone like Spielberg with his Schindler's List hat on. 

Thought the stuff with Florence Pugh was utter nonsense and totally egregious, however true it may have been it added nothing to the film. I was riveted at times, completely lost in the movie, then suddenly acutely aware of just how long I had been sat there. Thought there were some fantastic individual performances, RdJ in particular.

Also, [Can You Hear The Music by Ludwig Göransson](https://open.spotify.com/track/4VnDmjYCZkyeqeb0NIKqdA?si=5c1183e6bc6f463e) is a sensational piece of music.",2023-07-24 10:05:29
"There were stretches of the movie where it was utterly brilliant. The trinity test, the clapping speech, Hill's speech.

But as a whole I was bored. This Nolan's style didn't really click for me. I have seen dialog heavy biopics from other directors and loved them so much. Bridge of Spies comes to mind. But those movies had lot more tension, suspense, the stakes were felt.

Here it just flowed with not much of anything. Entire world was at stake, but I didn't feel it. Time was ticking apparently, but it wasn't shown. What was so great about getting the clearance, what did he accomplish which he couldn't before. How was their progress being seen by the higher-ups. What was the blocker and why did it take 3 years for the bomb to be completed. 

3 hour biopic but none of it is explained. Some really do have boring answers, it took 3 years cause it's hard and needed lot of reasearch. There was no boogeyman stopping them. In that case, deciding to make this a biopic even was a mistake. 


Nolan Could easily have written an alternate history Sci Fi where they create the same atomic bomb but with a better story. He could have had his cake (practical effects for nuclear explosion) and eat it too (his very own suspenseful time bending story)",2023-07-26 21:11:27
"I enjoyed this movie (7/10) overall but something about Nolan's directing just falls cold with me, and not just in this movie. The endless quick cuts, the lack of stillness, the timeline jumping, black and white, no now it's colour, another movie with the dialogue issues. He's had a great career but he's also gotten shots at projects that I think other directors could have done more with, I think there's a lack of true genius/ability with Nolan.

The film also just should have focused on the Manhattan Project, the true beating heart of this story, the stakes of his later career and political battles were just so insignifcant compared to what happened around the development of the bomb. I'm sure this is a common criticism but those last 45 minutes were just tedium.",2023-07-27 04:52:11

"Man I feel really underwhelmed. It's good but no where near the ""masterpiece"" people made it out to be.

Felt very rushed but also dragged at the same time. 

The explosion scene was phenomenally done, and the ending was fantastic. Performances were great as expected from this stacked cast.

But I don't know, I just didn't like it as much as I hoped I would. Maybe needs a rewatch.",2023-07-29 13:42:43
"This film blew my mind. It scared me, the ending left me quite speechless. The extreme closeup on Oppenhemier, with the background distorting as his reality breaks (happens in other scenes where he disassociates too) is so incredible! Cillian Murphy has to get an oscar

What a shocking ending though, serious slap to the face. We will either die of nuclear war or climate change, maybe both :(",2023-08-05 00:02:55
"Had the immense privilege of seeing this in IMAX 70mm.

"I watched because I love most Christopher Nolan movies but mannnn  me and my gf had to stop and pause this like 20 times to try and understand certain words that were not in our vocabulary and to try & remember which characters are being disussed and what all the political jargon meant and damnnn we still probably missed like 70% of what would have otherwise made it exciting to watch

Often I found myself bored but trying desperately to understand what was happening lol

I'd like to consider myself a fairly intelligent person but I just couldn't understand the dialogue! Hahaha",2023-12-15 03:27:16
I feel a lot of people in these comments were expecting a giant CGI exploding with Oppenheimer jumping in a fridge last minute to survive the blast.,2023-07-22 21:59:41
"i was disappointed.  i dont mean to exaggerate or overstate anything - i really dont remember the last time i was this bored in a movie theater.  the sequencing and scene changing style that persisted through the movie were really not for me. i also found the dialogue to be too on-point with no filler and it felt super unnatural, like an actual conversation got chopped into pieces and only the relevant information was spoken.  i dont think ive ever gotten either of those 2 impressions from a film before, and they really took me out of it.  lastly and probably most importantly, i just thought the story itself was not exciting.  im glad everyone else is enjoying it, but im sure my partner and i arent the only ones who just didn't really get the hype.  its a neat history piece that i would watch for the same reason i'd watch a nature documentary if i was in that mood, but it wasnt a big exciting blockbuster in my opinion.",2023-07-23 17:34:58
"I went to the theaters excited for what I thought was going to be an intense and cerebral movie, but I left unimpressed and rather bored. 

1. The movie’s overbearing score and frequent flashing sequences left me exhausted when those elements of the movie were actually important 

2. The “twist” in the movie felt anticlimactic. The source of the twist came out of nowhere without enough character development. 

3. The first hour of the movie rapidly changed scenes at a pace that made each scene seem unimportant to the plot of the movie 

I’m not saying that the movie was terrible. It was still a good movie. But it’s not one of the “greats”. Nolan has definitely done better work",2023-07-24 13:48:52
"Let's take away all the bells and whistles by which I mean the fantastic sound and visual effects, which are par for the course in a Nolan film, and this film is 3 hours of a congressional hearing. You have vast amounts of exposition and dialogue of a very technical subject matter (obviously they didn't delve too much into the science of nuclear fission and rightly so, but the point stands) and the machinations of Washington politics and McCarthyism, set over a booming soundtrack. 

It just felt quite jarring and wasn't particularly engaging. Can't help but feel the subject matter would have been better suited for a limited TV series. I would feel particularly hard done by if I saw this in IMAX, because beyond the explosion, there weren't exactly numerous visually captivating scenes.",2023-07-28 23:30:14
"No need to go out of your way to see this on IMAX or whatever.  The visuals were disappointing.

It was a good movie.  7-10.

Would never watch again though.

I was expecting more test scenes and being blown away by the visuals.  

Was basically staring at Murphy's bone structure for three hours.",2023-07-30 02:23:18
I guess I’m the only person who thought it was boring,2023-08-06 03:49:23
"This just didn’t do it for me.

The subject had high potential and Murphy is a perfect pick for the character, yet his was only explored so much, up until the Trinity test — after which my interest vanished. It started well though, exploring his psychological complexities but where the movie lost me was with the whole Russian spy accusations and communism storylines which could have been greatly reduced. 

The women roles in the film are sadly pointless. Einstein lacked any depth and wit as we should expect from such a legendary person. The dialogues between him and Oppenheimer could have been iconic. Then, too much music at the wrong times. The many dialogues, composing the movie’s action, unchain way too fast with few pauses and to me just lacked sensitivity or heart.

The Trinity sequence was good with a relieving moment of silence.

The black and white scenes are stifling, visually it’s nothing fantastic, and overall the images don’t really live up to my expectations for Nolan and IMAX. 

And again, the moral compass being the crux of such a subject, I wish it would have been fully explored: yet in the second half, Murphy’s Oppenheimer seems almost invisible, dormant. RDJ’s was a big question mark for me: the character doesn’t add anything of value. Everything feels stifled, flat, unimportant. The ending leaves little remembrance.

In the end, it’s way too long, the pacing and rhythm are off, feel obnoxious and the story never breathes. I like Nolan and his work with Momento, Prestige, Inception, Interstellar but this was another waste, just like Tenet.",2023-09-12 23:04:43
"I Personally think the movie was over hyped, I came in with to much high expectations from people saying it's phenomenal one of christopher nolan best movies produced within decades besides Interstellar. 


[CONS] - The begging was strong flashing back an forth within scenes killed it for me. It was annoying how there wasn't enough time for the audience absorb the information and breath. Just FLASH INFORMATION FLASH DIALOGUE FLASH NEXT SCENE... 

- I wish there was subtitles because the background soundtrack were overlapping with dialogue at certain points of the film. 

- There was little character development. Some characters appeared on film because they were important but I didn't know who they were and what happened to them

I don't wanna bore you anymore but everything else was amazing the actor, visual effects, Emotions etc..",2023-12-30 12:39:31
"I enjoyed the movie, although like many I have criticisms. I'll hone in on my biggest one which is that I think it was an artistic mistake to not show the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was intentional on the movie's part, they wanted to be subtle and only reference it. But a major theme of the movie is ""they won't understand until they've used/seen the bomb"". So show the audience. Show the actual instant incineration of a hundred thousand souls.",2023-08-07 16:53:37
"Nolan (or some fan) should release the Film with the scenes in chronological order. For a biopic, having to jump between discussions was tiring. Getting yelled at by multiple sources took a toll on Oppie as well as me.

Acting was great, but I hope wardrobe and make-up get praise. I was able to see it in the 70mm IMAX form. There were some nice tracking shots of walking and scenery, as well as  beautiful close-ups of actors, but I believe it isn't all too necessary to travel and find a theater. 

I will grow to appreciate the film more with subtitles and viewing it alone rather than in a packed theater.",2023-08-16 22:29:10
just finished it. one of nolan's weakest films imo.,2023-11-30 02:32:03
Couldn’t stand it. Every scene felt rushed and the dialog was too choppy. It felt like I was watching a 3 hour long trailer. It was a race to the end and yet there was absolutely no payoff. They tried to fit too much story into short scenes when they should have slowed down to help ground the audience and allow for actual character development. Acting was great but that’s about the only good thing I can say about this film. So underwhelming. Can’t believe people actually enjoyed that mess.,2024-01-10 05:10:42
"I feel like people who aren’t as knowledgable on history or politics, especially revolving around the US, will be quite lost and bored. The trailers seemed to show the movie as more about Los Alamos and the Manhatten project, but what we got was a trial and a lot of post war politics and geopolitical talks and maneuvering. Definitely seems like a movie for history/politics enthusiasts rather than one for people just expecting the development of nuclear weapons and the horrors of them. 

For context the entire final hour or so is about a trial relating to his potential communist links and removal of security clearance and subsequent reputational loss.",2023-07-21 10:43:21
"I felt underwhelmed by the movie.

 It jumped around too much and it was hard to really sympathize with Oppenheimer because they offer you nothing to sympathize with. We don't see the horrors of the bomb. We aren't given enough to really get his relationship with his mistress or what she meant to him. The opening scene is him trying to poison a dude for no reason. I did not care for him as a character at all.

Then it was also unnecessarily pretentious with him saying the famous phrase while fucking his mistress - yes I'm super sure that really happened. Then with him imagining the quantum world in the beginning to the point of losing sleep, but then that just magically goes away once he gets sex(?). That could have been an interesting angle, but it just disappears.

I felt like they could have focused on the political intrigue, or the bomb itself. But they did some hybrid that didn't really seem to work. Expectations were set without delivery.",2023-08-08 05:59:02
"Oppenheimer is two movies. The one about Oppenheimer and the bomb is great. The one about political battles with a bureaucrat is maddenly boring and just irrelevant.

It was so frustrating to have that part ruin the otherwise great movie. 2/5, just awful",2023-08-20 17:39:46
"A LOT of people in this thread who don’t understand what a character study is. The movie is called Oppenheimer, not How We Built the Bomb or Cool A-Bomb Explosions. I’ve seen a lot of comments saying this movie didn’t know what it wanted to be and I couldn’t disagree more. This is a character study of Oppenheimer the man. Everything else is just a framework to explore him and his story. Outstanding film.

The scene alone perfectly gets that point across",2023-07-22 01:19:04

"I feel like I'm going crazy here seeing everyone saying it was too long and the last hour with Strauss and the hearings should've been cut. For me, the last hour was probably my favorite part of the film.

Admittedly, I'm a major Manhattan Project/atomic history nerd. I've read *American Prometheus* and *The Making of the Atomic Bomb* multiple times, among other things on Oppy and the project. If any part of the film was a bit of a let down, it was the time at Los Alamos. That could very well be due to my familiarity with the subject, but I felt like it was lacking depth. Curious to know what people not as deeply familiar with the science and history thought of those scenes.

I never once felt bored, the 3 hours felt like like 1 hour, I could've easily gone for another hour of run time.

I think that a lot of people are going to be disappointed by the  focus so much on Oppy's personal like and downfall rather than the Bomb and Hiroshima/Nagasaki, but the films title is Oppenheimer, not The Manhattan Project. It's a portrait of a deeply fascinating and complicated figure, who's actions, alongside all those on the project, irreversibly changed the course of human history. I absolutely loved it",2023-07-22 08:31:00

Great direction, great acting, great audio, great emotion building, great visuals both evocative and real, and of course incredible storytelling with the time jumps to introduce the psychotic anti-leftism of post-(and pre- tbh)war USA, and then returning to resolve it after the los alamos focus in the middle. Also a great coverage of the relevant parts of Oppenheimer’s life

I was on the edge of my seat for literally three hours, and people call it a “boring biopic”??? Like wtf!?!

I get that it wasn’t for you, everyone has different taste, but holy hell, it was not a biopic, and if an event that has affected the whole world since it happened is boring to you I really don’t know what to say..

"My only complaint is that the first 20 minutes were *very* quick and felt I wanted more from Pugh’s character. After that the movie really got into its groove and never let up. Also, I think that scene in the gym is the best scene Nolan has ever made. That singular scream, the melting face, stepping in a charred corpse… yeesh",2023-07-23 02:37:57
"Two jump scare explosions to represent the two bombs dropped was a nice touch by Nolan because I was shitting bricks when the room got bright during the scene of Oppie and Rob going at it.

Waiting for that third jump scare explosion that never happened was some edge of your seat horror shit.

"My favourite part of this movie was how the ending calls back the scene where in the early stages of the atomic bomb one of the teams biggest fears is atmospheric ignition. A runaway reaction that sets the entire atmosphere ablaze. The film does a wonderful job of visualizing this theory. 

After some calculations, they determine that the chances of this happening are near zero, Oppenheimer even laughs about this with Groves. They are confident in what they are creating. 

This is contrasted in the ending of the film. Oppenheimers fear is of thousands of nuclear warheads being detonated that set the entire world ablaze. Eerily similar visuals to the atmospheric ignition. Oppenheimer’s near zero confidence that they will destroy the world is now near zero that they won’t. 

Haunting.",2023-07-25 14:23:32
"I recently saw the new Oppenheimer movie, and the main reason I like it so much is that it's really good at giving me goosebumps, especially with the ending.  
So this question goes to people who have also seen the new Oppenheimer movie: what other movies can I watch that are just as good at giving me goosebumps as Oppenheimer; and are also not classified as horror movies?",2023-08-04 02:56:20
"Just finished a second watch, this time at an IMAX, and I thought it was even better. It was a lot better knowing who all the characters and timelines were going in and not worrying so much about keeping everything straight. To me, this is a 10/10 movie.",2023-08-04 22:12:16
"Saw it last night in 70mm IMAX. Great movie.

I gotta say though… if you don’t live near a 70mm IMAX theater, I really don’t think it’s worth making a special trip unless you’re *very* interested.

Yes, IMAX is still better than standard format. Yes, it’s a unique experience to watch a movie on film, and there are some spectacular shots that fill the entire screen. But this movie has no action sequences and not much special effects. It’s about 90% characters in rooms talking to each other.",2023-08-09 15:26:37

"I felt before the film, I didn’t even want to look at books and readings about Oppenheimers history and how the Manhattan Project and Los Alamos unraveled, I wanted to go in blank.

After watching, I wish I did. The first 2 hours was unbelievable, if it simply ended there I’d have called it Nolan’s best. My god though was that last hour such a bore. I had no clue about what was going on as they were so much names and people, I didn’t know who was who. Maybe it’s just a me thing, I literally study for a degree in Politics yet it’s the political side of the film I really didn’t enjoy 🤷‍♂️",2023-07-21 23:45:11
"The movie was overwhelming, leaving you feeling quite upset and deep in thought. I really enjoyed it. It is absolutely not for everyone but a very interesting character study of a very complex man who changed the world. You do not feel resolved and happy, you have to feel what Oppenheimer and Einstein felt with the burden of knowledge. Maybe it was the hype and/or plot, people seemed to have thought this was going to be a Michael Bay style action film filled with explosions... I feel the action is what goes through the intense mind of Oppenheimer, we don't need endless bombs and to show what truly happened in those Japanese cities. Similar to Dunkirk, you don't have to see the war and bombs to feel the horror. 

Cillian was absolute excellent. He stole every scene he was in. RDJ pleasantly surprised me taking on a serious role, I think the last time I saw him in a drama was The Judge. Emily Blunt was great but I thought her accent was inconsistent. I love Safdie brother movies but haven't been impressed by Benny's acting and thought his accent was bad. I didn't really care for anyone else, not really happy to see Jack Quaid and a bunch of others thrown into the movie but they weren't distracting at least. Gary Oldman took me a couple of seconds to recognize but he really stole the show in those few minutes of screen time.",2023-07-22 02:02:42

"I could actually hear all the dialogue in this one, 10/10

But for real, that’s the best script of Nolan’s career. Best use of broken timelines since maybe Pulp Fiction. Haven’t seen an audience that dazed during the end credits in a long time. Maybe Nolan’s most complete work.",2023-07-22 06:17:32

"I really like the movie overall, but perhaps it's because I avoided watching any clips or reading too much about it before. The only part of the movie that made me all \~ was the absolutely random Florence Pugh sex scene with the Bhagavad Gita (indian twitter uproar in 3...2...) - it felt pretty forced. Kind of like fan service in anime. But I don't think it ruined the movie, just didn't add much imo. Maybe it was because Nolan was trying to add all aspects of Oppenheimer's life? Idk I'm tbd on this thought, what does everyone else think?

I did like the similarity between Oppenheimer's relationship with Jean and the bomb. Both being things he created (the relationship and Jean's anxiety + the bomb) that he felt guilt for. To that effect, my favorite line was Kitty saying ""do you think if you let them tar and feather you, the world would forgive you?"" It reminded me of the time earlier in the movie when Kitty scolded him when Jean committed suicide and told him he doesn't get to do something horrible (aka cheat on Kitty) and then have everyone feel sorry for you.",2023-07-22 23:53:23
Now that was a movie for adults. Loved it.,2023-07-23 03:49:45
"I haven't seen this mentioned in any of the top comments, but the whole middle section (basically until the Trinity detonation) felt like a 1,5 hour trailer to me. The way scenes and dialogue were cut together just seemed so odd, it was jumping back and forth from location to location and across timelines every 5-10 seconds with almost zero breaks in the dialogues. Oppie shows up somewhere, says 3 lines to another scientist, cut, now he's on a train with Matt Damon and they say 3 lines to each other, cut, now he's back in Los Alamos and says 3 lines to his wife, cut, now he's somewhere else again and talking to another scientist for 10 seconds, cut, and so on. No breathing room in any of these scenes and it even seemed like they cut the dialogue so that the lines follow each other directly without pause, and that made it sound unnatural (hence the trailer comparison). I didn't love it as much as apparently everyone else here.",2023-07-23 13:52:27

"I loved how smart and concise some of the narrative elements are: 

- One of the scientists mis-speaking and saying “bomb” instead of “gadget” to get the codeword across to the audience
- Using bowls of marbles to represent progress and build tension
- A whole other affair is heavily implied with practically 0 actual screentime used
- Being able to instantly recognise time periods with the receeeding hairlines and greying hair of the male characters

I’m convinced Nolan didn’t want this movie running a single minute over 3hrs and for that reason had to be creative with exposition. For a director who sometimes struggles with exposition (Tenet, Inception) it worked massively to his benefit. Refreshing to watch a movie that trusts the audience to piece it together, and (most importantly) *actually* gives you enough information be able to do that.",2023-07-24 13:31:21
"Apart from hearing his name in history class, I was not at all familiar with Robert Oppenheimer before going into the theatre. Is it fair to say that Oppenheimer, as potrayed in this film, was an extremely complicated man? Cause I don't know what to think about him. I felt the brilliant genius inside his head, the weight on his shoulders of carrying the burden of knowledge, the inner motivation/conflict in his heart of having to create something so destructive and evil and the guilt that came with his creation. But I also felt his massive ego, his carelessness and his indecisiveness. A lot of what Lewis Strauss (and also his wife) said about him in the final third of the film rang true, even though a part of me wanted to ignore him because Strauss himself was no saint either and because I felt bad for Oppenheimer for what Strauss had put him through. 


I'll need a rewatch or two to come to a more definitive conclusion, but Oppenheimer didn't come across as a hero nor a villain. And not an anti-hero either. It's difficult to define what he is after watching this film. At first I was confused by this, because my brain is wired to label characters in hollywood films as heroes and villains. But the more I think about it, the more I'm fascinated by how Oppenheimer is potrayed in this film. Cause there are lots of different ways to interpret his character. Which makes me look forward to my second viewing of this film next week even more, because then I'll be watching it with friends instead of going by myself. Oppenheimer is a film that doesn't give you many answers but leaves you with a lot of questions to contemplate about and to discuss and talk about with others right after you leave the theatre.",2023-07-24 20:59:41

"Holy shit!!!!!!! the tension, the build up in the trinity test sequence my heart was pounding so fast in that moment accompanied by the masterpiece of a sound design. Nolan really knows how to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. This is truly an experience for years to come. Cinema's alive as long as we have christopher nolan 🙏🏻",2023-07-26 23:19:58
"Hello! My wife and I are very interested in going to see Oppenheimer in IMAX but she has quite a lot of anxiety about the theatre, but she wants to see this movie in IMAX. The number one thing that she is worried about, that we cannot find any info on, is the vomit scenes. Seeing people vomit makes her extremely anxious and she has heard that there is at least 1-2 vomit scenes. 

I just want to get some insight into when these scenes are so she can either turn away or sneak away to the bathroom at that point!",2023-07-27 01:13:10
"Went back and saw this for the second time yesterday morning - and it did a ton for my appreciation of the film. The three major storylines (building the bomb, Oppenheimer’s clearance hearing, Strauss’ confirmation hearing) are weaved together beautifully, the chemistry between the actors is fantastic, and Nolan shows us a lot about how the characters see the world without telling us how to see it.

I think my final conclusion is Oppenheimer was cursed with the gift of his mind from the beginning. The PTSD and nightmares certainly crescendo after Truman drops the bomb, but they start way back when he’s a lab student. Whether he became “the father of the atomic bomb” or just became tenured professor at a prestigious university, he was going to have demons either way",2023-07-27 14:36:14

Also, I just felt so uneasy when he'd go right into another scene just as you were getting settled into the current one. It adds to the tension, but also lost me a few times. Great movie and loved how the ending played out.",2023-07-30 00:04:05
"Great movie overall. 

Sound sucked (as usual for Nolan), dialogue was really hard to understand at points, and the third act was kinda slow. 

The first two acts were really good, I'll probably end up watching it 100 times over my lifetime.",2023-07-30 02:18:55
"I thought it was good, but the amount of jumping didn't work for me. I get the unfolding story about Oppenheimer and Strauss, I get it's a biopic 100%, but that's where I bounced off.

Where I'm coming from is that the story told in Rhodes' *The Making of the Atomic Bomb* was much more compelling to me than Oppenheimer's martyrdom. The gradual accumulation of scientific knowledge leading up to Hahn and Meitner splitting the atom, secreting scientists away from Europe and the Nazis, the Norwegian commando raid on German heavy water, the incredibe violence of fire bombing and the war in the Pacific, etc. all felt like the ticking bomb Nolan would be interested in. There were moments in Rhodes' accounting where I felt almost like once humans discovered physics a nuclear bomb was going to happen one way or another.

I also felt that while the story certainly addressed the moral quandaries of the bomb, and the horrific devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that reckoning feels more poignant and affecting to me as a climax than Strauss' downfall and Oppenheimer's redemption. Again, I recognize it's a biopic on Oppenheimer, but I think that's the story I'm less interested in than the inevitability of The Bomb. 

The cinematography was top notch. The Trinity test was worth the IMAX alone. The acting was quite good, and Cillian Murphy was compelling. I think I just bounced off because I, personally, was more invested in other aspects of nuclear development.",2023-07-30 03:47:49
Very much worth a rewatch. I wasn't a fan at all the first time but gave it another chance a few days later bc I got cheap tickets. Criticisms are still largely there but it's def more gripping the 2nd go-around.,2023-07-30 08:34:32
"saw this in 70mm Imax and it was such a surreal experience, felt way more real than i was expecting, i just got so absorbed in the film i felt like i was just watching the real thing play out, the 3rd act was a little long in my opinion they could of shaved 30 mins off altogether but i still really enjoyed it.",2023-07-30 20:08:05
"I liked this movie but I think the second half fell a little flat. They treat it as a big twist that RDJ was against Oppenheimer but they aren’t even shown to be super friends or anything. And Rami Māori appears for like 2 minutes. Sure Oppenheirmer didn’t want to sign that thing but it isn’t even a big twist.

And it went on for way too long. I think they could have definitely shortened that second half a lot.",2023-07-31 17:08:19

I also totally understand 90% of the complaints people have, I think it just worked out for me because I've already had a lot of interest in the time period, the manhattan project, aswell as just a general liking of both legal and political stuff.

Not a single part of the movie felt like a slog to me. Add to that the gorgeous cinematography and fantastic score...

The craziest thing about this movie is how, when they starting building up to it, I felt no excitement to see the bomb go off. More dread than anything. And the dead silence in the cinema was incredible.",2023-07-21 07:52:31
"Stunned with everything. A revenge story much like Amadeus but with the most realistic explosions ever depicted on film. If there was ever a justification to blow $25 on a movie ticket, do it for this film- you NEED to experience the ‘terror’ of everything in as loud an environment as you can. 

Also loved the film’s depiction of McCarthyist paranoia, and how “out of left field” it hits Oppenheimer. There’s a lot of talk about where exactly Oppenheimer leans and what he believes, but I think the Flag’s flowing upon the celebration at Los Alamos tells it all. 

Also go bears 🐻",2023-07-21 08:08:24
"I don't know what to say, it's not a movie about the bomb and it doesn't have some crazy plot twists. It's not forcing gyou to cry or feel proud or whatever. It's just a really decent period drama.

I feel like a lot of people may find it's 'slow' or lacking 'events' since we're going to a Nolan's movie, duh, but I really enjoyed it.

It leaves you with this feeling of not wanting to go back to the real world and just immerses you completely, I don't feel it that often, if that makes sense. Like when you need 2 hours after the movie to shake it off.",2023-07-21 08:16:10

"Really enjoyed it.  I think there are definitely some valid criticisms about the run time and the going back and forth between plots/timelines/etc., but on the whole I thought it was great.

There were some incredible performances from the cast, and I personally didn't have ""can't understand/hear"" the dialogue problem people often complain about with Nolan (I saw Tenet 3 times in theaters, and the biggest issue I had was understanding some of the deep accents, not necessarily just understanding the dialogue to begin with).

The nature of the film reminded me a lot of A Beautiful Mind, which I also really like.

I don't think it's perfect, nor do I think it's Nolan's best, but I do think it's very good and will enjoy it again on streaming when I can take an intermission.",2023-07-21 23:28:24

"It was ok. The acting, cinematography etc were great, but blimey that narrative structure jumping back and forth in time for no good reason with those overstylized black-and-white scenes (also for no good reason) was tedious as hell. It's such a Hallmark movie type of cliché to make a whole story centre on a trial, even one that isn't really one but actually is one. The non-trial was the least interesting part of Oppenheimber's life story, it's weird to put so much emphasis on it. I know it's meant to be about his glory and demise, but that's also such a tired trope. The moral implications of his work and the whole dilemma and burden it put on him are far more interesting, it should have been more of the movie's focus.",2024-04-04 17:45:40

Matt Damon's line of "" I'll kill him, just kidding he hates me not America."" Killed me, he nailed his performance, as did everyone in the movie.

"Another Nolan masterpiece. Not his best (nothing could beat Inception and Interstellar), but still enjoyable. And true to Nolan's style, the chronology of the story is all over the place, in a good way.

That said, I still went in blind (i.e. without watching any teasers and trailers) and am pleasant surprised at how star-studded even the supporting cast is, and their cameos didn't feel cheap at all.

We got Kenneth Branagh as the charismatic Niels Bor who inspired Oppie to further his study of quantum theory in Germany, Rami Malek as David L Hill who played a crucial role in ~~Iron Man's~~ Strauss's downfall, we even got Gary Oldman going from playing Churchill to playing Truman being annoyed at Oppie for being ""a crybaby"" about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when Truman says as a matter of factly its ultimately Truman who pulled the proverbial nuclear trigger on those cities, not Oppie.

For others played by lesser-known actors, I'm amazed at the amount of actual historical figures and scientists that I learned in school involved in the Manhattan Project who made an appearance. 

Figures like Fermi, Feynmann, Heisenberg just popping in like they were always there.

Nolan also put attention to detail in many interesting ""side-stories"" from these characters. 

Stories like:

1. how Niels Bor got smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Denmark into neutral Sweden, and then had to fly a new experimental RAF aircraft that bypassed Nazi-occupied Norway to take him to Scotland. But to do so, the aircraft needed to fly at very high altitudes, and Bor forgot to wear his oxygen mask and fainted during the flight.

2. how Secretary of War Stimson spared Kyoto from getting nuked because he and his wife ""honeymooned there"" (Actually, the Stimsons honeymooned somewhere else, but Stimson did indeed visited Kyoto before the war, and must have liked it enough to strike it off the list of Japanese cities to be nuked)",2023-07-27 12:52:12
How does Nolan’s sound mixing still suck ass after a decade and a half?,2023-07-27 23:56:37
"This was a wonderful character study, where we explore two distinct and different individuals, and we look at their narratives and the stories they tell to themselves about their individual relationships with knowledge, power, risk, and morality. 

What struck me was that, while they pursued ends differently, both Oppenheimer and Strauss are frequently worrying about the same thing things, but doing so in their own respective ways and therefore reaching different conclusions. In the end, I felt like both men come across as very tangible, deeply flawed, real humans. 

As a curiosity, I saw Oppenheimer in IMAX with my wife who is 36 weeks pregnant. When the bomb went off it startled by son out of sleep, and into violent wriggling.",2023-08-03 17:44:45

"Man this movie was a huge drag to get through. Definitely a big let down. 

The beginning of the movie felt completely jumbled. Jumping back and forth between multiple timelines with constant dialog made it hard to actually get invested into the story. The middle act of the movie with the development of Los Alamos and the testing of the bomb was easily the best part. I wish the movie expanded on that more. Instead, the final act and last hour of the movie was just a huge disappointment. The final ""gotcha"" moment to Strauss at the end just didn't do it for me. 

Overall, I really feel like the marketing was misleading. The trailers made it seem like this movie was centered around the race to get to the atomic bomb. Instead, it was really just about Oppenheimer losing his security clearance. Not sure why this was claimed to be a ""must see in IMAX,"" when the movie consists almost completely of just dialog.  

Also, come on, did anyone else laugh a little when he used the famous ""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" line while having sex? That was just too ridiculous for me.",2023-08-22 20:59:25
"This movie isn't terrible, but neither is it a masterpiece.

Too me - it can be summed up as: too much of everything and too little of anything.

It tries to show you so much about Oppenheimer's life and the circumstances surrouding it in a quantitative sense, that nothing gets discussed with any substance. Oppenheimer is a communist, womanizer, deeply conflicted, genius and whatnot, but none of those aspects felt really tangible at the end of it. Due to that I almost never was emotionally grabbed by the movie and the result was a huge issue with its tension curve - if you can call it that.

The only part where I felt tension and involvement with the story was during the Los Alamos and Trinity sequence - albeit the actual explosion feeling anticlimatic.

The movie also doesn't do itself any favors by putting in all the time jumps. The presentation is already very fragmented, as it pertains to following Oppenheimer chronologically, due to the linear timejumps, hence why the jumps into the future feel like a distraction from the core story no matter how well RDJ plays in those scenes.

The final interview part was largely uninteresting to me, as Oppenheimer's interests in Communism are never explored (why does he support it? what stakes does he hold in it).

In the end it - the movie looks good, has a very very strong cast and gets carried hard by an honestly even stronger performance by CM (considering how much you can do with always looking sad into the camera, he wasn't given much). It ends up being visual eye candy that leaves a lot of character arc and depth to be desired.

This movie will probably create a Rick and Morty situation where people who are simply not interested in Biopics and McCarthy era US Politics will think it's boring and the other camp will call them idiots. It's not an easy to watch pop corn movie that's for sure. I enjoyed it immensely though I'll give it a good while before watching it again. I was physically and mentally tired at the end.,2023-07-21 14:19:25
"It was a good experiences but somehow I have many gripes with it.

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, Strauss's conclusion was kind of a bummer, that is the part where Nolan put his complicated puzzle pieces in the movie (not complicated thankfully) but the full completion of that puzzle was a whimper. The build up to the explosion was brilliant but the explosion itself was mediocre.  They have the cadences to not show Japan's destruction and go with the hallucination but the hallucination itself was too shallow, it doesn't hold any impact and too brief.  The layering of the sound cues during that was great mind you, just the visual.  Talking about the the visual, the visual representation in the first half of the movies were way better than the second half with the coiling of the molecules and everything but when it comes to the visualization of his anxiety, it lacks the oomph.  They rely more on the score and sound cues for the anxiety but I think some hyperbole in the visual department could be improved.  

I respect and appreciate the small changes in film and visual cues but probably not enough for me. I think Nolan improve his sound and narrative writing but tone down in the visual department for this movie.  I hope next time he can find some balances since I was really disappointed in some key moments in the movies (The test explosion, the hallucination of the bombing victim, the moment his wife breaks down, the moment he find himself exposed) or maybe that's just me and my high expectation.

&#x200B;

Either way, a great experiences.",2023-07-21 18:43:19
"Generally i liked the movie, perfect acting, quality set and production. As a biopic it stands very well, in my opinion. Trinity test was meh, it lacked the scale and visuals, looked like 1 ton explosion, with tnt cloud. It's shame Nolan doesn't want to use CGI, there is a remastered video of this test IRL on youtube, i guess it's possible to be mixed into the frame and make it BIG, he has money for that. This is maybe the single point of the movie that i dislike.  
Also not worth IMAX because 3 hours and it's mostly dialogues with lots of close face view, makes you appreciate the makeup though.",2023-07-21 20:47:11

Downvote me.,2023-07-22 06:48:48
"Oppenheimer opens up the same way it ends. with the pitter-patter of raindrops on the cement floor, maybe signifying how it rained fire from the sky on 6th August 1945 in the Japanese town of Hiroshima. The movie does an excellent job of showing the trauma and the dilemma faced by Oppenheimer both while designing, and in the aftermath of the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, like a lot of Nolan movies, does not have a linear timeline, the story is split into three main timelines, which indeed does help build suspense and makes certain scenes more satisfying, like the ending with Oppenheimer and a certain scientist (No spoilers)  
  
Cillian Murphy is perfect in the role of Oppenheimer as he perfectly expresses the mental war going on in the mind of a scientist who wonders what to give priority to, his duty or his moral obligation. The parallels with the bhagwat geeta are also fascinating, as that scripture has a similar moral dilemma going on with the prince, Arjun  
  
RDJ Knocks it out of the park, never thought I could hate a character played by RDJ after endgame, but yet here we are. Emily Blunt and Matt Damon as well, absolutely brilliant in their roles, loved Emily Blunt's demeanor throughout the film and how she represented a woman beyond the stereotypes of the 1940s.  
  
Florence Pugh though ,the character didn't really seem too strong and doesn't give much of a memorable performance here, didn't feel any of her scenes had much power or a memorability to them  
  
The Trinity test scene is by far one of the best cinematic pieces in any Nolan film, no arguments there, it won me over.  
  
Coming to its flaws now, especially as an International viewer, I feel Nolan expects the audience to be pretty well versed with every event from World War 2 (that too from the American perspective) and of American politics, and even with the timeline of events along with which countries were in what teams, moreover, the film has way too many characters, to the point where in certain sections of the film it gets confusing and you cant understand what exactly is going on and who are they talking about?, this brought down the level of the movie for me and was a real bummer, I'd say for a solid 20 minutes I was wondering ""Wait who exactly was Roger Robb?"", ""Who's Evans?"", ""Who's Rabi and where did I see him before?"" the fast pace doesn't help with this either because Nolan doesn't give me breathing room to realise who the character actually was.  
  
Is this Nolan's best work? No, that is Inception for me followed by The Prestige and Interstellar  
  
Overall, I would give it a 7.5/10",2023-07-22 13:12:07
Loved it. Definitely not the movie I thought it was going to be. Many were concerned Nolan was going to make the atomic bomb explosion look “cool”. But the trinity test is probably the meekest thing in the movie.,2023-07-22 13:36:55
"I rather liked the nonlinear plot, finding it pretty easy to follow. The dialogue was very clumsy at times (the 'physics and New Mexico' line actually made my theatre giggle), and it feels very ""tell don't show"", but I don't think it detracted that much— each actor does very well with their parts. It's a spectacle at points, with sound design that made my stomach sink and genuinely brilliant moments of cinema. I really like how the existential dread of the bomb is conveyed, and the last usage of the ""world swallowed by flames"" visual was well worth the price of admission alone. The awkward moments dragged it down for me, but I enjoyed my time in the theatre with this film. As much as you can enjoy this kind of film, anyways.",2023-07-22 14:51:52
"Saw it Thursday immediately after a stressful day at work and wasn't in the right mindset for a Nolan film. Gave it a 7.5/10

After seeing it again, I can confidently say this is a 9/10 movie and arguably Nolan's best. Only gripes are runtime (seriously Hollywood, knock it off with these 3+ hour showings) and somewhat shaky storytelling.

"I know that the B&W scenes are supposed to be subjective while the scenes in colour are objective, I didn't fully realise by subjective that means they're subjective to Strauss instead of Oppenheimer until the reveal.

I honestly wish the movie had been 5-hour long instead of 3 lol - though I know that's nearly impossible, at least marketing-wise in this day and age. The first half was a bit rushed to me, it felt like Nolan had to try to cram a hefty chunk of both history and science into it, even with the fairly liberal amount of runtime.

Anyhow, I know for a fact I'm seeing the movie again. I haven't felt this thunderstruck leaving the theatre practically since Parasite.",2023-07-23 02:50:13
Just left the theater about an hour ago and what a surreal experience. Telling that important of a story in such a beautiful yet tragic way had me in awe the whole runtime. Performances were off the charts and the silence in the theater during the trinity test is truly something I’ll never forget. In my opinion it was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. (Side note - a Nolan bond movie would be perfection),2023-07-23 04:29:09
"I enjoyed the movie most when it not whipsawing between different timelines. I didn’t see much point to such a non linear story line. When it finally settled on Los alamos and one timeline it was much better, it felt focused, it really drilled into Opps misgivings over the bomb, trying to not be as conflicted as his fellow scientists until it really hit him.

Dc Politics and the university conflict between communist and non communists could have been aggressively cut down to be more tight than a slow 3 hour film. It’s never good when 30-45 minutes could be cut off and the audience would still get a similar affect.

Past the twist, i doubt much would have been lost considering the film was fine having a huge epilogue after the bomb test and explosion.",2023-07-23 04:55:14

It's only every few years a movie has such an impact on me, due to my lack of hnderstanding of an area I don't know anything about. This might be one of my all time favorite films for that. I've been meaning to study science and mathematics, and usually I only ever think of the positive aspects of it, but this film really demonstrates the complexities that come with it. We all vie to do something great and impactful, but what I have always enjoyed about that word, is that people don't consider that whatever impact you make, there's something on the other side of the force taking the major hit. This movie is for sure in my top ten for making me really just think about a lot. I'm trying to take my dad this week to see it. Hope you guys enjoyed as much as I did.",2023-07-24 19:51:04
"Wasn’t expecting the who’s who of actors to be in this film, but it was worth every cent. Everyone puts on their best performance, the sound design is absolutely perfect & it made 3 hours feel like maybe 2.

"This is basically The Wind Rises if Miyazaki's wonder was replaced with Nolan's dread.

After the near-perfect first two acts, the third act involving the McCarthyist interrogations and hearings lacks the tension. It simply cannot compete to the ""will the Nazis get to the bomb first?"" stakes. 

I know this is a biopic about Oppenheimer's character, not titled ""The Manhattan Project"", but much of the plotline at the end could have been shortened to 20 minutes at the longest. The movie is nonlinear anyway, so I wonder if there could be a fanedit that restructures most of the third act scenes to before the bomb detonation, so that rather than a movie split in clear two stories, the constant momentum of creating a bomb would pace out and elegantly make it more of a cohesive experience as a whole.

I'm saying this because The Wind Rises did that and still managed to be a thought-provoking character-piece. As much as I found tearjerking the romance in that movie, I would not have been fond of it if Miyazaki made that a ""real climax"" long after the successful flying test. The final four-minutes ending of The Wind Rises speaks as many things about the character and theme as Oppenheimer does in its overlong 50-minute third act.",2023-07-25 23:14:33
"Lots of great acting on display, but the use of music was just bizarre. Every single scene, that rather uninteresting blaring music, at times making it hard to hear dialogue that was obviously important to the plot. It felt weirdly amateurish, compared to everything else in the film.

Also, what was the deal with that poisoned apple scene in the beginning? Oppenheimer did indeed try to poison his teacher, but in real life he got caught – he almost got expelled, and was forced to go see a psychiatrist. This is not what happens in the film, where they have him almost poison Niels Bohr by mistake but then managing to avert the whole thing. However, in the film when Oppenheimer talks about the incident with another character, the sequence of events he describes is the one that took place in real life (tried to poison my teacher, got sent to a psychiatrist) and *not* the one Nolan showed us in the beginning.",2023-07-27 19:08:57

"I agree with quite a few criticisms, even though I enjoyed it. Not sure I'd want to watch it again though.

Nolans movies can be frustrating.... He has some weird obsession with ""time"" in different phases, and seems like he has some shortcomings when it comes to telling a human story. This could have been a better movie in the hands of someone else.

I also feel bad for Florence Pugh. Spends most of the movie naked, for no real reason. Nolan typically doesn't put nudity in his movies, so it seems like an odd choice",2023-08-07 17:27:49
"I was looking forward to this one, but like some others here, ultimately the experience was disappointing. In my view its major flaw, which choice I understand from a thematic standpoint, was wrapping the core story of the development and dropping of the bomb inside the comparatively bland and bureaucratic proceedings of the committee hearing and security clearance interview.

This structure was a major disservice to the emotional experience of this 3 hour epic for me, largely because it was just about impossible to re-engage with that storyline or care about its dramatic questions after going through the wringer of the development and dropping of the bomb. Every little question about whether he was a spy and was strauss going after him was, in my experience, trivial and near impossible to care about anymore, AND i had to endure that trivia and remember the sterile details of who trusted who to do what for another whole 40+ minutes. That home stretch was mostly clock watching for me. I do understand its function, but that whole dimension felt overdeveloped and the best candidate for trimming this down to a more emotionally engaging and tighter 2-hour experience.

In the end, this didn’t work better for me than any other decent biopic, significant improvement over Tenet, but sitting well behind Dunkirk or Interstellar (both of which were also much better imax experiences than this very talky excursion)",2023-08-16 14:46:18
"For me this might be Nolan’s best movie.  Doesn’t have the flash or the flair of Inception, Interstellar, and the Batman trilogy but the story was brilliantly told even though most people know the end result. That the bomb was successful. 

Most impactful moments of the movie to me where the conversation with Einstein and Oppenheimer by the lake and the way the context of the scene changes throughout the movie. 

You get to see it from afar and it looks like one thing. Then you see Strauss’s interpretation of it and it looks like something else. Then you see it in its entirety with the conversation between Einstein and Oppenheimer that you get the full brunt of it.  

Top notch filmmaking right there.

Also a wild Gary Oldman appears and completely steals the scene he is in",2023-07-21 12:05:17
"Man, this film was really testing my patience at times. Honestly, I found the whole Robert Downey Jnr timeline a chore to sit through.


The best parts of the film are Oppenheimer's beginnings and the middle stretch covering everything within Los Alamos and the bomb.


Everything else after felt convoluted to me. The Imitation Game did the whole 'betrayed by his country' plot better and more efficiently.


Lastly, sound is still a big problem in Nolan's films. There are scenes where the rustling of clothes/footsteps whilst people walk is louder than the dialogue. I can't comprehend why that is a stylistic or conscious choice?",2023-07-26 22:08:05
"I wanted to like this movie but I regrettably could only find myself agreeing a lot with all the hater-esque opinions on the internet.

The movie was engaging from start to end. That's sounds like an impressive feat for a 3-hour movie... only if it was in a vacuum. It was engaging simply by keeping the entire movie at a stagnantly fast pace and equally stagnant tension. To put it very crudely, it's like scrolling TikTok for 3 hours - you are technically engaged for 3 hours.

The idea of ""show, don't tell"" felt so wrongly executed that it went full circle and became just ""telling"". Do you need to show Oppie naked to show his shame? Do you then need to show Jean riding him to show the hurt in Kitty? Do you need to have the defeaning sounds, jarring cuts and white light flooding the scene to show Oppie's internal strife? Cilian is known for his phenomenal face acting - just let him do his magic, man. The only part which leverages that is the very last shot of the movie.

To me, a great movie should leave a big impression and be thought-provoking after the fact. After Oppenheimer, I'm just like "". Ok."" Yeah, it's not an ""ugh"" but there's no ""wow"". Let me compare it with 2 biopics: The Imitation Game and Steve Jobs (2015).

* People generally know Alan Turing is considered ""the father of computers"", he had a notable contribution to the war effort against Germany and he more or less died because of his homosexuality. The movie did a good job of dramatising his early life for us to feel for him. It did neglect the sciencey part (like Oppenheimer) but the emotional drama made up for it. I left with a better understanding of Turing as a person, good and bad.
* Most people agree that Steve Jobs is a visionary. Some consider him a genius, others don't. A good number of people also know that Steve Wozniak was the man behind the scenes. The movie did a fantastic job of showing why Jobs is a visionary with the way he thinks and perceives things. It also had a good balance of showing the ugly side of him as a person. I left with a better understanding of both Job's greatness and lowness. Also, impressed with the performance of Fassbender and especially Seth Rogen in a serious role.

Everyone knows that Oppenheimer made the atomic bomb. Almost everyone knows - and has watched - that clip where he says the iconic ""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"". Most people could infer that he felt regret over the fact that Japan was nuked. The movie added nothing to this aspect. The movie's way of attempting to show Oppenheimer's internal strife, as mentioned earlier, honestly felt less compelling than that one footage of the real person speaking on television. It even culminated in him literally going to the president and saying out loud ""I feel like I have blood on my hands"". Bruh, we may not all be detectives but we can take a hint.

The movie put an emphasis on the communist accusations against him and I actually thought it was good - people don't really talk about that part when thinking of Oppenheimer. However, the execution just couldn't cut it. There was no attempt at dramatising, just having things look bad for Oppie at first, then \*plot twist\* Strauss is the bad guy, then the movie presented Hill speaking for Oppie and against Strauss like a deus ex machina sorta thing, then bad guy loses, yay happy ending. Okay? This was an opportunity to show the significance of that trial for Oppenheimer personally and they let it slip.

And a special mention: Oh dear, the incessant camera cuts during 1-on-1 dialogue scenes towards the start of the movie. I know, there is no right or wrong in filmmaking or in the creative field in general. Still, that's *the* classic amateur-of-amateurs mistake. And I'm not nitpicking - it's not like I'm scanning through the film again to scrutinise it. It was so jarring while I was watching it.

Perhaps the one thing I liked was the very final moments of the movie. I liked how it circled back to the very start of the movie and it was a good line. Good way to end a 3-hour, all-over-the-place biopic. It did have that thought-provoking spark, although it's nothing novel (Oppenheimer's opinions on nuclear weaponry) and the final 1% certainly can't carry the other 99%. My lasting impression is mostly... this was quite a waste of all the acting talent, especially Cilian.",2023-08-01 07:46:08
"I guess I was confused, this whole time I was expecting the trinity test scene to transport us into the actual gaget at the moment of ignition, showing the firing pins igniting the explosives and the chain reaction. They showed small glimpses of what I thought that might look like but when the test finally came it was pretty underwhelming.",2023-07-21 04:08:49
Josh peck definitely got cut out of that film badddd,2023-07-21 14:57:47
"Only 10%ish into American Prometheus before seeing the film last night. The book quickly dives into Oppenheimer's erratic, moody, and intense nature that I think Cillian Murphy and Nolan nearly perfectly depicted. At first, I thought the film started with too much scene cutting, but as it progressed, I think it actually set the tone well. I thoroughly enjoyed how it went back and forth, morally speaking. Oppenheimer, and the Los Almos team in general, were taking this new, beautiful physics that emerged in the last 20 years and turning it into the potential destruction of mankind that still poses a threat today while being both immensely proud and devastatingly guilt ridden. Having these scenes of an arms race in one of the most influential wars of all time interwoven with the destruction of Oppenheimer's own career was so well done. All the acting, from Murphy to Downy Jr., to the far too few Blunt scenes, was just phenomenal. Will definitely be seeing the film again in theater's when I finish the book. 

10 out of fucking 10.",2023-07-21 18:01:44
I fell asleep,2023-07-21 20:43:18
"Decent film with some brilliant scenes and moments (the  bomb test, his speech, Oppenheimer's wife being questioned)

I just didn't enjoy it as much as I was hoping to. Didn't really care for the convoluted Strauss plot. Maybe that was just a bit too subtle for me. 

Also I don't think the chain reaction metaphor wasn't as clever as they thought. Feels a bit like Nolan built the film around this.",2023-07-21 23:14:41
Florence Pugh was the real bomb in this movie. 🤯,2023-07-22 00:42:41
"I’m a pretty big tech/nerd guy. This was my first movie I. 70MM Imax, and I was not impressed at all. It was just big but nothing else really stood out. I was in an end seat which made it awkward. What am I missing?",2023-07-22 13:36:32
"Solid but the final third repeatedly lost me. Everytime I thought I understood what was happening, something else happened and I was lost again. 

Also didn't really see the point in Florence Pugh being in it, the scenes didn't do anything for me. 

1st half was much stronger IMO but didn't think Nolans style was especially suited to a biopic. There were a lot of great shots but it's still really exposition heavy.

It worked better once they moved on Los Álamos and when the plan was being formed up to fruition.",2023-07-22 20:07:26
[deleted],2023-07-22 20:42:50
"Anyone else have trouble hearing the dialogue?  I'm wondering if it was just because of IMAX, but it seemed like the score was twice as loud as the dialogue and it was hard to follow what was going on.  Honestly I thought most of the movie didnt need a score at all.",2023-07-22 22:02:06
"My feeling coming out of this movie is that I had a read on everyone *but* Robert Oppenheimer by the end of it. For a biopic it's incredibly not insightful about his motivations, his beliefs, his origins, or even what he was really like when he's not being bad at running meetings.

All of the scenes where he's not in public - where it's him and one of his women, for instance - Murphy plays him as a cypher, as though Oppenheimer leaves himself in his pocket when he takes his pants off. The scene that most literally sets itself up as the *reveal* - where Oppenheimer, under the probing inquiry of Strauss' clearance renewal board, is literally exposed - actually turns out to be the reverie of his wife, as the secret tragedies of their marriage are suddenly laid bare.

It just seems like a whole movie full of things that happen *to* Robert Oppenheimer, including Lewis Strauss' falling flat on his face due to absolutely nothing that Oppenheimer actually did. (Why did we need an hour to set up the downfall of this guy who had nothing to do with the Manhattan Project at all?)

And what's even the moral of the movie, as delivered by Albert Einstein? ""Robert, remember to hold a grudge against these scientists you worked with for the rest of your whole life""?

> Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide
> Scott Grimes as Counsel

Really? I see it as evidence that Nolan pretty substantially misuses the three hour runtime that a 1/3rd of the movie is given over to this section where 2/3 characters don't even have names.",2023-07-23 04:50:39
"Not sure where the complaints about the sound mixing is coming from. I watched it in an IMAX cinema, and the only parts I couldn't hear, are the parts that obviously aren't supposed to be. Like when they're talking about the H bomb for instance, where Oppenheimer was disassociating with the world. 

I was absolutely fine with everything else, and could understand it perfectly fine. Even the more complex dialogue. Much better than Tenet, which even I can't defend. 

I loved the approach that was taken for the film. It had an ethereal feel for the first hour and I liked it. There was a bit where I felt it went a bit long after the test, but it picked up pace and finished very strong. 

I loved all of the performances in the film, and I don't think I can say that about most films. 

And the music was perfect and used so well. 

One film that will stick with me for sure. This is for sure one of the scariest films I've seen in a while.",2023-07-23 15:26:58
"I remember leaving the movie theater and couldn't believe that 3 hours went by that fast. The pacing was perfect and never felt like there was a lull in the screentime. 

Every 10 minutes some big actor just randomly showed up and I loved every time that happened. Even though you knew that the test was going to be a success, when the countdown was happening and they knew the chance of a chain reaction of potentially lighting up the atmosphere, I had a goosebumps and hearing Oppie breath as the test is commencing was surreal.

Overall, solid 4/5. IDK if I'd see it again due to the time but absolutely a must see regardless.",2023-07-24 14:48:17
"I was super hyped for this movie because I've been a fan of Cillian Murphy so I was excited to see him finally get a lead role in a big movie, plus I quite enjoy biopics. 

I would say this met my expectations and then exceeded it. The build up to the Trinity Test was thrilling and I felt tense and on the edge of my seat. I know a lot of people were disappointed with the explosion but I thought it was sufficiently impressive - I especially liked how they used silence as in that moment it allowed me, as an audience member, to feel a combination of awe, anxiety (for the sound that was about to come) and dread. 

I was expecting this to maybe be the climax of the movie, but when it went on to the conclusion of his security clearance being revoked, and even later into his life when he was given awards etc., I realised Nolan was trying to fit Oppenheimer's entire life story into this 3-hour movie and the Trinity Test was just one significant moment in his life. Vast amount of content. I appreciate the ambition of the movie but I can't help but wonder if it would have benefited from a tighter storyline / narrower scope, as at times it felt like it was rushing through events. I would say come into the movie with some understanding at least of Oppenheimer's history as the movie doesn't spend too much time explaining things to you and assumes you have some contextual knowledge already (e.g. I was lost on what was going on with Strauss at the Senate).

Also I know some people think they should have actually shown the Hiroshima bombings and aftermath, but I actually think it works that they didn't - the movie is about Oppenheimer's life, we see things from his perspective and he didn't actually get to see the bombings. It's not a disaster movie so I appreciated it actually that they didn't do that, though when he was watching the slideshows I felt like one or two photos to show the effects would have driven the point home a bit more. 

I would give it a solid 8/10 overall.",2023-07-25 19:35:57
"This felt like a TV mini series shortened and edited to a film. Many scenes seemed short just to establish a beat. Weirdly enough, for a three hour film, there wasn't enough time to simmer on personal rivalries, etc. That's my main complaint.",2023-07-28 00:18:57

**PSA: You don't need to see Oppenheimer in IMAX or 70mm.**

**EDIT**: Scratch the 70mm bit; I don't know enough about it. It may well be a worthy pursuit, but I stand by the IMAX disclaimer.

I'm only saying this because as the release approached, I saw a bunch of articles about how this movie was going to change the way we see movies // it's a landmark production // the only way to experience it in IMAX or 70mm or even 70mm IMAX as Nolan intended, etc.

I just saw it. GREAT movie. I loved it. I saw it at my local Cinemark in the XD theater, so a bigger screen than most, but nothing super fancy.

Anyhow, of all the big-time landmark movies that might make this claim, this is not the one that you need to see in IMAX.

I saw *The Matrix Reloaded* in IMAX back in the day. I think it's the only movie I've ever seen in IMAX. It was fun (I was in college and got stoned in the parking lot beforehand, so extra fun / uncomfortable somehow). But that film had a certain draw to it that made sense -- it's a big-budget, huge set piece action movie, we all loved the original Matrix, and given its nature, IMAX suited the experience.

Now if this were *Mad Max: Fury Road* or Villeneuve's *Dune* or even an animated gem like *Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse* \-- or even one of Nolan's other ventures like *Inception* or *The Dark Knight* \-- I'd say that IMAX would be a grand way to experience these movies (I know that it's not that simple and that special cameras are involved in filming, etc.).

My point is, the vast majority of this movie is just men in suits talking to each other. It's men in suits at a legal hearing; men in suits at what looks like a deposition; men in suits in a classroom; men in suits making preparations for the Manhattan Project. Don't get me wrong -- I was glued to the screen. It's wildly compelling stuff. I waited until the last possible moment to jet to the men's room to pee. But it's certainly nothing that needs to be seen in the IMAX format where the giant screen devours your peripheral vision and you're paying $28 for a movie ticket.

See it on a big screen. It's a great movie. But you don't need to dish out the premium ticket for that special movie experience when you're just watching people talking to each other for most of three hours.",2023-07-28 11:59:48
"I couldn’t keep track of all the characters - so few of the supporting cast of scientists were developed enough to properly understand their motivations or allegiances. 

The guy who ran outside to watch the test, I honestly couldn’t remember if he’d been in the film at all up until that point, or if he’d been set up as someone impulsive or something and this was an example of that.",2023-07-29 18:50:09
Christopher Nolan really is a master filmmaker and if there are any aspiring filmmakers this film is a great one to study.,2023-07-31 00:45:23
"Just got out of the movie and I am completely blow away by Oppenheimer. I was one of those sceptics when the trailer came out and almost decided to not watch the movie but good God Mr Nolan indeed delivered. 

The performances of the stellar cast, the making, the visual effects, the background score everything about this movie was pure brilliance. This is cinema at its best. 

Cillian- that was a performance of a lifetime. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt. Robert Downey jr all brilliantly  performed. 

Finally, Nolan - thank you for delivering this master piece which otherwise would have ended up as a Netflix documentary.",2023-08-02 13:53:12
"All time great movie, it was an experience to watch it. One of the best movies I've ever seen and I've seen over 2000 movies. This falls in the top 10-15 easily. Absolute masterpiece, the score is amazing and just added to the suspense. Nolan found a way to make a biopic into a suspenseful thriller. A 3 hour long movie, a biopic, and rated R will have likely grossed close to $1 billion when it's all said and done. Fucking masterpiece. This is art.",2023-08-14 04:45:51
"I wasnt intrigued to watch it. Because i saw 3h and biography...but i gave it a shot, to see why is so many people praising him...and now i know. This movie is damn good, history and political aspect is brilliantly made. Acting is on point.",2023-11-21 18:33:05
"I just got out of the 70mm film showing, and was kind of underwhelmed honestly.

I knew it was a straightforward historical biopic, which I'm fine with, but it was just a lot of (like a lot) of talking in rooms and direct logistical depictions of the actual production of the weapon. The big ""payoff"" scene was personally underwhelming, since they went with an extreme close up of the explosion (for obvious reasons, since Nolan didn't want CGI) and I felt a ton of the impact of the test, the explosion, and the ramifications for mankind was lost.

Overall it felt way more direct history chanel biography to me than cinematic experience about a man, a project, and a weapon changing the course of humankind.",2023-07-23 09:13:36
"My honest opinion is going to get me hate for this but I’ll say it anyway. I didn’t think the movie was that good. 

Yes it managed to keep me entertained but that was impressive due to the fact but the way it was portrayed was pretty shoddy. The play on the timeline was hard to follow at least to begin with. The confusing use of black and white shots to show scenes from Strauss’ view was not obvious. The black and white seemed to initially present scenes that happened after the creation of the bomb which led to confusion until you later figured out what they were trying to portray. The first 30 mins of the film felt like it used 30 seconds clips to introduce every character one after the other. Not long enough for the characters being introduced to create a lasting imprint in your brain. Some of these characters seemed to only be reintroduced in the last 40 mins of the entire film meaning you had completely forget their names and who they were from the beginning of the film which at this point was over 2 hours ago. The scene transitions and time leaps seemed random. One minute Oppenheimer is teaching a class, the next he’s attending a party with seemingly no mention or lead up to the party actually happening from what I can recall. The whole movie to me played out as if it was a mood board, random scenes and ideas that were important to the plot of the movie but lacked any actual structure to lead one scene into the next. It felt like reading a book that had all the major plot points for the story but no build up or Segway into each plot point. Like a bullet point list of events in Oppenheimer life rather than an actual movie. 

The cast was great
The subject matter fantastic
The scenes overall entertaining 
But the structuring of the film absolutely ruined it",2023-07-26 00:38:10
"I’m in the minority, as I didn’t enjoy it. The score, the tension, the cinematography were all fantastic, but I was bored.",2023-08-04 23:29:47

"Every time I thought this movie would end, it kept adding another 20 minutes lol. 

Good movie, but I'd probably never willingly watch it again.",2023-07-23 06:19:52
"Surprised be the amount of people who seem underwhelmed by the film. I think a lot of people seem to have come in to the film expecting spectacle first and foremost because of how much we've heard about Nolan and practical effects, but at the end of the day this movie is a character study. Yes the IMAX format can be used to heighten the spectacle, but here it's used so we can see every pore on Cillian Murphy's face. It's more about close ups on moments of high emotional intensity than about making the explosions look impressive, and I think it succeeds.",2023-07-25 00:46:45
"I think it was spectacular.

Pretty much every conversation was brilliantly written and acted which is absolutely essential for a film like this. The film is gripping and filled with tension, but doesn't ever pretend to draw tension from the questions of whether they will successfully build the bomb or not.

The politics and characters of the film are complex and brilliantly showcased. I really enjoy the way the story unravels personally, and allows Nolan to sneak in his non-linear storytelling and some twists in a story that most of the audience know the outcome of.

I really don't think it was overhyped, but you could argue it was wrongly hyped. The sound design is spectacular, and the successful bomb test is wonderfully directed, but I don't think that's one of the scenes that stick with you when you walk out of the theatre. I'm glad I saw it in IMAX, but the things that make the film sensational wouldn't be lost watching it at home.

An an absolute smorgasbord of incredible actors, given some fantastic dialogue to sink their teeth into, coupled with Nolan's typical top class sound and visuals.

I think it's Nolan's first home run in a while.",2023-07-26 19:06:51
"I literally was able hear like 30% of what was being said. Nolan really needs to work on his sound mixing - and he can’t make an excuse for a movie like this, which is solely based on dialogue.

"I felt the themes and ideas were there, but it was sooooo poorly executed. I saw this with three friends. We all work in the film industry, so we had a long discussion afterwards. We agreed on a lot of things, but interestingly I was the only one that came away disliking it.

I think the purpose of the trial and communist angle is to show that in the war machine anybody and everyone can be a casualty- a microcosm of dropping a bomb on innocent city/bystander. Even for someone like Oppenheimer, the father of the bomb, was just a pawn in the game who can be chewed up and spit to the side. Oppenheimer gave the US an incredibly powerful weapon and edge in the war, yet ends up becoming a casualty himself.  He tried to speak on the dangers of the bomb, but gets silenced in the end. That's why at the end, they say ""The awards aren't for you""- he's just a pawn to use and they use his notoriety for propaganda - lauding him on magazines like an American Hero. If you drop a nuke, it doesn't give a flying fuck if your its Dad does it?

So I felt the idea and theme was there, but incredibly poorly executed. The scenes, dialogue, story, character dynamics, felt so redundant, repetitive, and long.  So many scenes where different people getting questioned about his communist past all felt the same, the plot never felt like it moved forward. Didn't feel like there were any cause and effect. Oddly, I didn't feel like his reputation getting dragged in the mud as a communist  or the trial didn't hurt his life, so the purpose rather seems meaningless in the end.  My friends and I discussed how people in a room talking can be interesting - look at 12 Angry men -  a masterpiece that still holds. The difference is IMO, 12 Angry men the arguments and dialogue move the story in different directions. For Oppenheimer, those scenes felt very repetitive and stagnant.

Even the scenes where Oppenheimer feels the weight of what he's done, just felt surface level to me. Any10 year old understands dropping a bomb is a horrific event. So the scene where he sees everyone nuked -  It was like ""oh yeah you didn't know bombs do that?"" lol. The purpose of Florence Pugh relationship was to show his loss, grief and how that relates to if he felt like how he lost someone to a nuke, but again it just felt so poorly executed. Pugh's character was so one dimensional and their relationship felt so forced and contrived.  After the film, I joked to my buddy ""Why the fuck he so hung up on his side piece?"" and we couldn't stop laughing about it. One second he meets Emily Blunt and they have chemistry, next scene she's knocked up, and then next scene she's suddenly a drunk - poor relationship and character development.

I think they missed the boat on exploring the humanity and duality of creating a weapon of mass destruction. The US was afraid of monsters that could use nukes on them, yet they become the monsters themselves dropping two bombs on a country that was ready to surrender. The morality of preemptive strikes was just an afterthought.

At the end of the day, we all like movies for different reasons. My film friends and I agreed it was too long, convoluted, repetitive, but they enjoyed it for various reasons. Some liked the history of it, some enjoyed  the artistic directorial and editorial choices, cinematography etc. For me, I'm very critical of story, character, so it just was not for me.",2023-08-20 19:44:52
"Hated that Nolan thought that this movie needed a pissy mustache twirling villain with monologue included with RDJ. ""He was mean to me with Einstein!!"" made me laugh",2023-08-28 19:26:17

I'm a Huge Nolan fan but I felt a little underwhelmed with the delivery of the trinity test. I don't feel like it delivered on the scale of horror it boasted. In fact the beginning explosions in the opening were scarier.,2023-07-21 14:17:40
"This movie was like somebody took a world class HBO show, 3 seasons of 10 hours each, and edited it down to a runtime of three hours. Every individual thing about this movie was amazing, casting, acting, cinematography, set design, music, etc. But as a cohesive piece, it suffocates under its own weight. Lines are delivered too quickly, the beats of the story aren't really connected causally, its just ""this happens, then this happens, then this happens"" for three hours. In my humble opinion, this film has so much wasted potential. If Dune gets two films, this should have had at least three. When some of the most interesting and enigmatic scientists of the 20th century show up as cameos with less than ten words of spoken dialogue, there's a problem. People are going to call it one of the best films of the year, but I honestly really don't see it. To me it's just the cult of Nolan all over again.",2023-07-22 21:03:13
Holy shit. What an insanely incredibly well done movie. Just saw Oppenheimer in IMAX. Finally a movie that lives up to the enormous hype and still delivers more.,2023-07-22 22:12:18
"Kinda surprised by all the lukewarm or negative feelings on the movie in this thread. It’s not my favorite film ever but the level of ambition and filmmaking pedigree on display here compared to 95% of other films we get in theaters now-a-days is not even comparable. I always enjoy Nolan films but he’s never been a go-to filmmaker for me, but this is my favorite film of his for sure. Seems like a culmination of all the techniques he’s built up over his career paired with an unbelievable adaptation of the novel, with which staying true to the original work was one of his priorities.",2023-07-23 19:40:15
"All the complaints about the Trinity test are a symptom of meme culture clearly getting to people lmao 

People really went in ready to rate this movie explosion against others like it was some Michael Bay type shit instead of a Nolan directed biopic.",2023-07-24 02:43:26
I think a lot of people are forgetting that the movie was a biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer. It wasn’t intended to be a history doc about the manhattan project or a science lesson about how fission works. The senate scenes are incredibly important to the story of Oppenheimer (not the story of the Atomic Bomb). Strauss successfully revoking his clearance and destroying his credibility alters the US nuclear policy for the duration of the cold war. Oppenheimer created this existential crisis and then his opportunity to try to fix the wrong he feels was made is revoked. He’s forced to live the rest of his life knowing he can’t do anything to help with what he created. Expecting anything else is like walking into dark knight and expecting more cuts of the joker than batman,2023-07-25 04:19:00
I'm realizing so many people are disappointed because for some reason they thought this would be about nukes and ww2 and not the guy the film is named after.,2023-07-25 14:46:05
"It was an incredible cinematic experience BUT...

The only thing I was bumbed about is the big elephant in the room:

The explosion...

The build up was perfection.

But the actual detonation was very underwhelming for me compared to the actual footage.

See for yourself:

I wish Nolan would have captured this better. I think it's lack of CGI played a factor in it not being/feeling nearly as big and impactful.",2023-07-25 23:06:17
"It was pretty enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of Christopher Nolan movies so I went in with tempered expectations, and what I saw was better than I expected. A few things I didn't like about it (or I thought was meh):  
  
Despite the movie clearly shooting to present itself as somewhat as an epic, the global physics academic milleu shown in Oppenheimer lacks charm and ultimately feels dull and lifeless, especially in comparison to movies like Goodfellas or Boogie Nights that pull off the vibe of a ""crew"" pretty well. Maybe scientists are just boring people, but I suspect it has more to do with Christopher Nolan just not being able to write or direct normal human interactions. Take the scene at the Christmas party for example - here is a perfect opportunity to spend some time letting the various characters we've only seen at work act more natural, feel more ""human"" to the audience, and Nolan has to ruin it right away by making the event all big and historic with Bohr being introduced at the party.  
  
There are some odd choices when it comes to detail. Like the one scientist dude with the drums - why is he always playing on the drums? It felt like a cool detail Nolan decided to put in because some character consultant on set knew that fringe detail about one of the scientists at Los Alamos. Just felt a bit distracting. There are other references to history that also are distracting like this (like the name dropping of John F. Kennedy, Marvel Cinematic Universe style).  
  
Some of the stylistic choices felt pretty stale. Like when Kitty hears about Oppenheimer's infidelity, or when Oppenheimer is talking to a crowd after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  
  
Also, despite the movie attempting to tell us so, I would assume that there's a world of difference between feeling guilty for developing a nuclear bomb that killed 70,000 people, and feeling guilty for breaking up with someone before they commit suicide? Like I get that Nolan's trying to draw parallels here since he's known for creating ""intelligent"" movies, but it's quite a stretch.  
  
I laughed when I saw Einstein appear from behind the car after Oppenheimer gets dropped off at his house - I get that Einstein's supposed to be the Physics Yoda in the movie, but it felt so out of place. A friend I watched the movie said he thought Oppenheimer had hallucinated Einstein in that scene.  
  
Emily Blunt's character was pretty bland. She seems to have a tad more character in the first half of the movie, but in the second half she devolves into a pretty stereotypical Hollywood movie wife/ Oppenheimer's anger translator.  
  
I just feel like Christopher Nolan just doesn't really trust his audience. He doesn't think they'll know how to respond to a scene, so he oversaturates most scenes in his movie with background music, and then stops the music at scenes that he really wants you to think as ""important."" He has characters often explaining what's going on in a scene to the audience because he thinks the audience can't grasp what's happening onscreen. This kind of spoon-feeding sometimes feels too obvious to the point where it almost feels 4th wall shattering.  
  
Despite these flaws, it was overall pretty watchable. The atomic bomb scene people said was underwhelming - I actually quite liked, but not enough to watch this movie again. 6/10.",2023-08-07 01:58:45
"I finally saw it last night. Had to wait that long to get a showing in 70mm. 

Great movie, expertly shot, acted, and the sound design was awesome. It could have lost 20 min of runtime and nobody would have known the difference (most movies these days have that problem).  As others have said here...there was a lot of of buildup of a few plot lines without a respectful payoff. Those threads could have been left on the cutting room floor and the movie would not have suffered one bit.  

That said...there was no reason to shoot a courtroom drama like this in Imax.",2023-08-10 12:50:52
"Huge Nolan fan, Saw in IMAX London. Underwhelming. 

Acting, especially Cillian, was brilliant. 

The audio mixing was borderline painful. Struggled to hear around 20-30% of dialogue over the ambient noises and average score (particularly in the first hour). The sound design itself is really cool but it's hard to take in and enjoy when you're being clubbed to death by it. 

The structure is really janky and barely felt like a Nolan film. Act 1 is a clusterfuck of dialogue and music passing by at light speed. Act 2 ending with Trinity is definitely the strongest. Act 3 was enjoyable but could have been a different film entirely. 

Visuals were brilliant but I wasn't a fan of the black and white cuts in Act 3. 

Film is decent but I probably would have enjoyed watching it at home more than IMAX due to the audio. Cillian steals the show. Easily my least enjoyed Nolan film.",2023-08-18 18:46:28
"Nolan has cultivated such a cult and brand surrounding him that any criticism of his movies that are not the technical aspects like sound mixing will be deflected by saying ""you just didn't get it"". 

Nolan made a pretty straightforward biopic that had some great moments but if this was directed by anyone other than Nolan this movie wouldn't get a fraction of the hype.",2023-07-21 09:54:38
It's a solid 8/10 movie. I'm just glad they didn't make anyone look like a hero.,2023-07-21 11:07:16
"Can i just say. I wished they added cgi to the test bomb. It was too small and too “free”( idk how to describe it)

As much as it looked good id definitely didnt feel like an atomic bomb. It felt like heaps of tnt detonated alltogether. My take only",2023-07-21 13:00:07
"To echo the comments of others, I think this is Nolan’s best work to date. It’s a bit messy around the edges and I felt like some of the time jumps in the first half did more to muddle than to clarify. But, it’s undoubtedly a masterpiece.

Also, RDJ and Emily Blunt steal every scene they’re in. I’m sniffing best supporting Oscar nom for RDJ.",2023-07-21 14:36:57
"I am very disappointed that the movie kept the lie that Los Alamos was created from scratch and not from stolen land, where the Latino population were given 24 hours to leave and all their herds were shot.  And then they were forced to work - without the protection given to white people.

Otherwise, good movie.",2023-07-21 18:44:20
"I’m glad so many of you enjoyed it, but personally I was really bored by it. I appreciate how well made and acted it was, but the structure of the story didn’t keep me engaged. Just kept bouncing around different periods of time without any room to breathe and it became hard to keep up with what happened when. Gonna watch it again in the future at home with subtitles and hope that helps.",2023-07-21 18:46:58
"I wasn't a fan. 

The cinematography and acting is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. 

On the other hand I found the pacing to be boring. I'm familier with Oppenheimer and his story and even then at times I found it hard to follow. It's as if the movie wanted to pull a Westworld season 2 and try to be obtuse as possible with telling the story out of order. I like that in fictional stories, but not in a bio pic with a lot of charectors. 

The marketing also heavily pushed nuclear weapons, and the movie swung and missed here. Oppenheimer in the movie of course feels bad terrible and awful for having created such a terrible weapon, but the movie doesn't really show why they're so bad and terrible. He winces at some slides of the aftermath of Hiroshima but they aren't shown in the movie. He goes crying to the President about his feelings. The movie didn't really show why he was so against it. We all know why but the movie would have been better served if it showed that better. It assumes the audience is intimently familier with why nuclear weapons are bad, but in the modern day I think the horror of nukes needs to be shown on screen to remind us. It tried by showing ICBMs flying and skin peeling off of random audience members but IMO it didn't get the message across. It focused more upon his personal hand wringing rather than about the topic of nuclear weapons themselves, which with the advent of the Ukraine war and Pakistan/India sabre rattling, is needed now more than ever.",2023-07-21 20:20:49
"Good movie. Chris Nolan does a biopic. 

The bomb is probably underwhelming on purpose, in order to show the disappointment Oppie feels.

In the scheme of things, the test was miniscule. 

In the scheme of things the real bombings are out of his hands, distant, unseen, but devastating long term for him and his psyche.

In the scheme of things, he was probably most hurt by the loss of his ""security clearance"" above all else in life. To go from being the 'heart' of top secret projects to being an outcast is painful. He was the golden child. Father of the largest modern weapon. 

The structure and focus were masterfully crafted to reflect Oppenheimer's perspectives, and that's a right proper thing. By no means a Hollywood blockbuster, but rather, the showcasing of how those hard moments felt to the genius himself as he rose and subsequently fell.",2023-07-21 22:06:10
Absolutely brilliant film. Can't recommend  it enough. Really well told and had some brilliant moments in it. Everyone was excellent as expected. Easily best film I've seen in the last year.,2023-07-21 23:22:30
"A phenomenal film from one of the premier directors of his era. The organization of the various storylines was not only coherent, but exceptionally crafted to represent the complexity and gravity of this dark period in history.

Brilliant direction, acting, and cinematography. Many people nitpicking the Trinity Test as underwhelming are missing the point. From the perspective of Oppenheimer, the bomb, and  its initial explosion, is not about admiring/glorifying its raw power and destructiveness, even after dedicating years of one's life towards its creation.

Nolan respects his subject matter and its surrounding history, doing well to not deviate too much into the stories of the side characters, but in highlighting their roles in relation to Oppenheimer.  The sex scene in the trial between Oppy & Pugh is one of the only complaints I have.  Nolan seems to be talking down to his audience and spelling out the words for them, afraid they are unaware of Kitty's perspective in lieu of Oppy's infidelity, which Emily Blunt masterfully does already through her facial expressions.

This film properly grapples with the agonizing moral complexity inherent to the bomb's creation, its purpose, and its future influence on world relations.  The dialogue is Kubrick-esque at moments with its humor, and is also reminiscent of screwball comedy in other snappy exchanges.  Most importantly, Nolan captures the development of Oppenheimer succinctly, as his arrogant and stubborn personality transforms into ambiguity.

One of the best films in the last decade, one of the most surreal and polished biopics, and arguably Nolan's best film to date.",2023-07-22 00:08:52
"Absolutely loved this film from start to finish, I was totally invested.  Some people are hating on this film, I am not a Nolan fanboy but I thought this rocked.  Cillian Murphy is such a great leading man.  

Question: This movie made me want to scratch an itch regarding Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project.  Any books you all could recommend?  

Thanks.",2023-07-22 00:47:30
"Wow. What a movie. This movie will clean up at the Oscars.

RDJ was just brilliant. Cillian delivered a near perfect performance.

I would have loved to have seen Adrian Brody in this movie.",2023-07-22 01:01:39

[deleted],2023-07-22 12:22:01
"Asking this in good faith, because i've seen this sentiment a lot, but why are so many people 'shaken to the core' by the ending exactly? I expected the end to be a real gut punch after everything that's been said, but Oppenheimer expressing that the nuclear weapon might be the destruction of us all is....

a) objectively true - he would have known that the second he understood the scale of the weapon, so why would it be a revelation for him to think that?

and

b) something he'd already expressed many times in the film already.",2023-07-22 14:50:39
"No CGI for a nuclear bomb that’s capable of destroying the earth as reiterated multiple times throughout the film?

A weapon that nearly eradicated two major Japanese cities?

A weapon that accelerated the arms race?

No CGI for a weapon so strong that it ensured the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction?

Extremely strange editorial choice in my opinion.",2023-07-22 15:36:33
Anyone else find the dialogue hard to understand/hear at times? Saw it in IMAX.,2023-07-22 16:08:18
"Just got out of my 11:15 viewing of this. Incredible film. Cillian Murphy rightly deserves all the praise he is getting and he will undoubtedly be nominated and possibly win best actor. 

However, to me RDJ absolutely knocked it out of the park as Strauss. He gave a powerhouse supporting performance. 

Anyways, the movie was sooo good. I could hear a pin drop in the theater during the “I have become death, destroyer of worlds” scene when the bomb went off. What blows my mind is that there was no cgi used. I’m still trying to figure out how they did that. 

Anyways, imo among Nolan’s best, if not, his best. Best Picture is likely in the bag.",2023-07-22 19:17:44
We must respect the genius of Nolan to turn a biography of a scientist into a blockbuster movie.,2023-07-22 21:53:39
"I’m pretty torn on this one. The acting was all very strong, so I have no complaints there. I think the final third was pretty underwhelming, though. All of that drama and arguing and talking over a security clearance. 

The thing really sticking in my craw is Oppenheimer’s relationship with his wife. She seemed so dedicated and loyal for the test and during all the security clearance stuff, but pretty much everything else made it seem like they didn’t really like each other. Weird dynamic.",2023-07-23 00:37:45
"Mixed feelings overall.
Film was gorgeous and extremely well-directed and acted, but it was overstuffed, overwritten, over-edited and over-scored.

Did not care for the communist ties stuff, and I wish the last hour had leaned more into him coming to grips with what he had done, rather than give us one (incredible) scene and have us take the rest for granted.

I thought the women were pointless, even though Emily Blunt was great in her scenes. I did not get what her deal was as a character. Actually, I didn’t get anyone’s deal as a character.

For a character study, I feel like I didn’t get to know a single thing about Oppenheimer’s inner workings. 

There was just too much going on, too much bombardment of dialogue, too much time jumping, sequences which never felt more than the sum of their parts.

The score, while lovely on its own, felt manipulative in creating dramatic tension.",2023-07-23 04:38:24
"I thought the first half felt very disjointed, more like a collection of scenes rather than a coherent movie. Do you guys think that was an intentional stylistic choice (maybe to show the craziness of his life then, to really juxtapose it with the post-bomb world?)

For context, I absolutely loved the movie. I thought it was alright in the first half save for the above comment, but the second half was astounding.",2023-07-23 06:15:39
"Just saw it, and I'm mixed. I knew what I was getting into with a biopic, a lot of dialogue and to hopefully learn more about the man who lead the development of the atomic bomb. However the scenes were so disjointed with multiple timelines and story beats that I had serious trouble following along at times. This felt more like a collection of scenes that somehow ended up being less than the sum of their parts. I also feel like I didn't get to know Oppenheimer that well, I could see how the creation of the bomb affected him as well as the legal battle with Strauss, but I felt like I didn't get to know him compared to other biopics. It was overscored to hell, not every scene needs to have a piece of music tied to the background. I thought Interstellar and Tenet had similar issues, so I'm assuming it's just a Nolan thing. I did enjoy the race against the clock aspect and the build up to the Trinity test was the most tense I've felt in a theater in a long time. Also absolutely loved the ending scene with Einstein. It was a solid 7/10.",2023-07-23 09:04:03
"Was overall a great movie and a wonderful cinema experience. 

However, can't help but feel like the non-linear storytelling was completely unnecessary for the most part in a film like this. A choice based on style over substance. It made the story that much more difficult to follow and almost pretentious. 

Also, didn't feel like there was an emotional connection with any of the characters at all, partly due to the speed of the film (3 hours of going at 100mph), which ties into my first point again.

The trinity test scene was absolutely amazing, loved how it was done, as well as the scenes following that, particularly the gym speech. Some of the best directing and conveyance of emotion I've seen in a while. Those are the 'show' parts of the movie. The third act unfortunately is entirely 'tell' and does not leave much to the imagination. A courtroom drama can be fun, exciting and thought-provoking. This had all the material to be that, but truthfully it just felt exhausting trying to keep up with all the information being thrown at you. Overall 7-8/10 for me.",2023-07-23 09:14:23
"In the third act, when RDJ was explaining to the audience how smart Oppenheimer was for fooling them, it was sooo annoying. Felt like a badly written scene.",2023-07-23 10:38:43
"The first half of the movie lost a lot of points in my eyes from the editing.  There were so many flashbacks, flash forwards, change of time, change of scene, etc.  At one point there was even a flashback within a flashback, which really got me.  It was digestible but so... unnecessary.  There was also probably 15 minutes of unnecessary material in the last act surrounding the trial over his security clearance.  The story really bogged down in that section.

People in the prisoner of the moment keep bandying around words like masterpiece and magnum opus.  But to me it wasn't, it was any other Chris Nolan film, which had like 95% brilliance, and 5% ""what the hell were they even doing here"".  Closer to an A- than an A+.",2023-07-23 11:09:10
"It was a good movie - but you really don't need to see it on an IMAX screen. In fact, I don't understand why Nolan even shot it in IMAX, since the majority of the film is just discussions between scientists/politicians, and the Trinity Test just looks like every other Hollywood explosion - in fact it was extremely underwhelming/disappointing.  I say Nolan failed to deliver on that end, especially when all the advertising says to watch this film on as large a screen as possible.  

So yeah, IMAX is very unnecessary imo - save your money and see it on a regular screen.

But still - good movie.  I'm sure Cillian and Robert Downy Jr will receive Oscar nods.",2023-07-23 14:00:38
"I am a huge fan of Nolan, but I must say I was a bit disappointed. I get that this movie is a biography about Oppenheimer, not atomic bomb. But the trailer and all the posters helped shape my expectations such that I expected to see more visually stunning scenes portraying the explosion (as well as the Nolan-typical science things). The movie was good overall but it fell short of my expectations.",2023-07-23 20:28:07
This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved it.,2023-07-24 03:09:35
"Does anybody feel that the whole discourse surrounding Nolan and his apparent disdain for CG has reached toxic levels? Especially in light of the news that he hasn't credited 80% of the people who worked on the VFX of Oppenheimer.Personally, as someone who feels that CG is an incredibly effective tool that has given us some amazing sequences ( and I'm not just referring to the great, but obvious examples like, say, Avatar or Gollum or Caesar, but more so something like Fincher's skillful use of them ), the whole current 'Everything is done for real' anti-CG trend just feels thoroughly mean-spirited to me, especially when they're downright lies and downplays the contributions of hundreds of CG artists who've put in their blood, sweat and tears into the work.And it's not just Oppenheimer, I noticed this with the new Mission Impossible, where all the marketing suggested that ALL the stunts were practical whereas it's evident that CG has been used ( quite judiciously I might add ) in all of the stunts ( something that even the director confirmed ).At this point, being a CG artist feels like an utterly thankless job - you do your job well, and nobody notices and are blamed when it doesn't turn out 100% perfect. All that after working for low pay under insane crunch and deadlines.Lastly, and this may be an unpopular opinion - Nolan's distaste for CG actually affects his work adversely in my humble opinion. Post Inception, none of his films's set pieces have ever filled me with awe or felt spectacular to me, Interstellar being the sole exception.CG works great in accentuating the impact of a set piece, even if it is mostly practical ( George Miller himself has admitted to used a lot of CG to heighten the impact of the stunts in Mad Max: Fury Road ) but most of Nolan's set pieces post Inception have fell flat to me. Not least of which was the much hyped Trinity Test sequence in Oppenheimer. The build up to the test was more exciting than the actual test itself. In fact, if anyone here has seen Twin Peaks Season 3, I wager you can attest to the fact that same test sequence in that film ( done with CG I might add ) conveyed way more of the dread, awe and sheer terror of an atomic bomb blast.",2023-07-24 08:10:12
"My first comment to my gf about this movie was, ""I'm so glad I read the book beforehand."" I don't know how anyone could follow all the political intrigue and characters involved in any other way. Maybe that wasn't the point, and people got the effects without necessarily following every line of reasoning and every accusation leveled at Oppie?

Also, Nolan's dialogue sound thing is still an issue. I felt I was constantly trying to decipher the dialogue, despite being a native English who had read the entire book a month ago, sitting dead center in an IMAX theater. Anyone outside these parameters, especially non-native English speakers will definitely have a hard time and appreciate when they can watch with subtitles. I know I personally will.

Having said all this, I enjoyed it and am just shocked at how Nolan basically adapted the whole book, minus adolescence and retirement.",2023-07-24 09:27:41
"Pacing was too hectic. Never a moment without score or dialogue. No chance to let the audience absorb anything, it was always right on to the next thing. At first I figured it was a reflection of the sense of urgency of the project, but the pace kept up for the whole movie.

Mixing was bad. I had to really focus to listen, and my girlfriend said she couldn't understand at least 25% of the dialogue.

The problem with not using CGI is that you're now trying to use conventional methods to portray a completely *unconventional* method of warfare. As a result, the Trinity test was underwhelming. There was no sense of scale to the explosion. The fireball looked like a pool of gasoline set on fire.

With such a lack of focus on the atomic explosions, why was there a need to see this in IMAX or 70mm? Sure the hearings looked good, but I would have enjoyed them just as much on a regular screen I think.

Good movie, got its point across effectively, but there was a lot that could have been done better in my opinion.",2023-07-24 16:11:23
"The movie was interesting for sure. But it dragged on for too long. There were plenty of scenes that could have been cut and the movie would be the same. There was no real plot, it didn't really feel like a story. There wasn't really a climax or resolution. It felt like a camera following around a real person, Oppenheimer, during a portion of his life.",2023-07-25 02:16:47
"this was easily my favourite nolan film. It's just so so good, I want to see it again immediately. Also as a science student, this was my infinity war lmao, it felt so funny that every 2 minutes another physicist showed up.",2023-07-25 14:27:28
"It’s so great that this movie is an event. I love Marvel but I feel like it’s applied pressure on directors to assume viewers have no understanding of nuance.

Oppenheimer isn’t needlessly complicated either, it’s not meant to be a mindfuck. The non-linear structure complements the narrative by contrasting the perspectives of Oppenheimer and Strauss as “fusion” and “fission”.

Class movie man, hope Nolan goes on to make more.",2023-07-26 14:46:46
"Just seen it, was one of the best films I have seen in the past 10 or so years. I expected more inaccuracies, but I was genuinely impressed with how much Nolan got right. The Trinity Test scenes were visually stunning and would give it a solid 9.8/10.",2023-07-26 22:41:50

"What a great film. I often come away from films with something about them I didn't like, or would've changed, but this is the first film in a long time where I couldn't think of a single criticism.

Every scene, every actor, everything was as perfect as it needed to be. 

I really enjoyed how the movie was essentially a deconstruction of great man theory; a lot of the characters see themselves as Great Men who define history, only to be bought down by their own hubris. Chiefly Oppenheimer and Strauss, but even Einstein, Teller, and Truman. Each one thinks they're the centre of the universe only to have it come crashing down (Einstein and Truman are loose fits; Einstein doesn't give off the same hubris as the others, but the outcome is the same, while Truman's treatment of Oppenheimer and his statement of ""they don't care about who built the bomb, only who dropped it"" channels the same hubris but we don't see the same vilification Oppenheimer and Strauss experience). What was ironic about this was that a trailer for *Napoleon* preceded the film.

Such a layered film. Probably Nolan's best.",2023-07-29 21:47:06

I like my fair share of slow movie but I definitely felt it with this one. Although I do like the film I did expect atleast more sciences revolving the nuke. I also think he should’ve used cgi instead of making a huge bomb look like a nuke cause I was able to to tell that wasn’t big enough,2023-08-01 03:09:28
"I love Nolan movies, but looking back at the Dunkirk release, I really don't understand how Oppenheimer had what feels like a lot more hype. I finally saw it today after trying to get IMAX tickets since release, and I didn't even get to see it in 70mm. I haven't seen a movie this sold out in a while. especially with Barbie hitting $1bil at the same time. It's like the country got hit with cinema craze.

As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it. Cillian Murphy is great. Gary Oldman blends in again if you don't see it coming. Everything around the test sequence is incredible. But this is a film about Oppenheimer and not the bomb, so it goes deep into the Strauss issue, and it ends up being too far IMO. A film about the bomb would have been a better watch but i understand we would have lost a lot of the nuances with Oppenheimer. the regret after the bombing of Hiroshima could have been slapped on to anyone but this was the Oppenheimer movie so we got a little more than that. i don't think i needed to see Florence Pugh naked in the conference room either...that was an excessive amount of nudity serving no real purpose. and lastly, what about the environmental impacts of Los Alamos? Oppenheimer took this place that he loved and destroyed it with lasting impacts to the environment and native people. and then personally, the University of Chicago scenes, there's no way you can convince me that basement was just 2 guys in an empty room and a reactor",2023-08-07 07:24:55
"I wish we could've seen the consequences of Opie's actions more than just him seeing visions, the whole point of what happened after Nagasaki and Hiroshima was that guilt he carried would've loved to explore that more instead of the courtroom drama we got.

Also hot take we should've seen the bombs in Japan go off, but I doubt they would give Nolan the budget to create more bombs.",2023-08-13 09:53:43

one of the best films i've seen in the last few years. every actor hit it out of the park, even the small roles. every beat hit the right note and the pacing was perfect. emily blunt's kitty has to be the best female character Nolan wrote as well lmao.

only issue i have is how the film shifts atmosphere pretty quickly post-trinity. the whole movie is centered around the security clearance but i thought it was over dramatized with the the clearance and hearings for strauss. maybe not exactly the most interesting subject matter to treat it with such intensity. still, it was all well shot and well told within the movie. so the only real issue is the dramatic shift towards strauss' hearings and oppenheimer's clearance.

other than that, near perfect story and storytelling by Nolan. I read the reviews and reactions and went in thinkint the dialogue will remain stiff (nolan) but i found it surprisingly engaging. yea, it's still nolan's dialogue but I thought it was still great. maybe it's the acting that carries most of it as well lol.

also really really surprising to see the two biggest movies of the year (barbie and oppenheimer) be this political and about progressive/leftist politics. don't think i've ever seen a big hollywood movie portray communists so positively and portray the government basically as the bad guys. and ofc, barbie was so explicit about the patriarchy. doubly surprsing it's Nolan of all people telling a story (pretty positively) about communists and communist sympathising figures.",2023-08-23 08:04:45

"Once again, Nolan leading with his head and not his heart. Could have been an extremely emotional movie but is treated as a cinematic documentary. Perfect movie for science nerds or history buffs of quantum mechanics...because nearly zero is explained...and what a shame because it's such a profound theory.

The score is essentially the lead actor. I know scores/tones are suppose to infer the emotion( or lack thereof) but this one demands how you should feel.

Movie itself reminded me of Oliver Stones ""JFK"" with how heavy the dialogue is.

"I don't understand how people go to watch a movie called oppenheimer,  about  a guy called oppenheimer , with the director confirming to make it historically accurate and then complain/cry on reddit that it was *boring* or should've been more than atomic bombs..wtf LOL.

Absolutely amazing movie, stayed historically accurate as possible, with amazing Symbolism and imagery throughout. Sound was on point and the direction of the film, switching between past and present, having the grey screen represent objective views not in the eyes of oppenheimer, was phenomenal.

"This movie felt like 80% of it was filmed around a boardroom, definitely don't need to watch it at IMAX

"Just a few of my scattered thoughts:

-This was much more of a biopic than I thought it would be. I expected it to focus almost completely on the Manhattan Project, so I was pleasantly surprised when it basically turned into a courtroom drama in its third act.

-As someone who didn’t really know much of the history other than the fact that Oppenheimer made the atomic bomb, this was a very riveting story for me with lots of twists and turns. The whole espionage sub-plot was really interesting and the “villain reveal” for Strauss was unexpected.

-Three scenes in particular gave me chills: the detonation, the speech, and the ending. The buildup to the detonation genuinely had my heart racing, which for someone who looks at movies as more of a work of art than something to be immersed into is pretty rare; I genuinely felt like I was there and I was horrified. Then you have the speech scene which was haunting, and did a good job of personally visualizing the horrors of his creation for Oppenheimer with the added bonus of not exploiting Japanese victims. Finally, that ending is one I’ll never forget. “I believe we did.”

-The acting performances were great. Murphy and Downey are both front runners in their respective Oscar categories. Damon is very much an unsung hero in my opinion and all the cameos were effective. I do wish Blunt was given a bit more to do but she had some good moments in the third act. 

-On a technical level this film is brilliant. The score might be my favorite in any film this year. The cinematography, visual effects, editing, and sound design were all top notch. And I don’t think this film will get anywhere near as many audio mixing complaints as Tenet did. 

-As for negatives, I wish we got to see more of Oppenheimer’s scientific genius on the Manhattan Project itself as opposed to in his schoolboy days. I also struggle to decide whether this film was about how the US Government diverted all the blame for the bomb onto Oppenheimer, or if it was about the dangers of the bomb itself. As a result it felt a little unfocused to me, but that might’ve just been a result of me not expecting the film to focus on Oppenheimer’s life as much as it did. An issue that could easily go away with a rewatch. 

-After Tenet it seemed like it became the cool thing to hate on Nolan for his films being overly pretentious and confusing with bad audio mixing. Now I have no problem with people hating or loving any filmmaker, even my favorites. It’s all subjective after all. But I do wonder if this film will put Nolan right back in the club of Reddit’s favorite directors.

All in all, I fucking loved it.",2023-07-22 04:06:22
"Long, long stretches of this film felt like 100 trailers stitched together, particularly considering the tense score that never lets up (especially when you're needing to focus on conversation) and that no scene seemed to go on for more than a minute or two. Acting was great, visuals were awesome, both as expected. Felt too long, though, and I wasn't alone. A lot of the audience was squirming and checking the time on their phones. It's getting a lot of praise but I would've found it more enjoyable if either shorter for a single film or longer as like a short series to give these great actors more opportunities with their roles.",2023-07-23 00:12:53
"I am a bit disappointed that the film didn't delve further into Oppenheimer's career post his security clearance revocation. His continued speeches and appearances, all the work he did post Los Alamos was still impactful stuff that definitely shaped global psyche on weapons of mass destruction. He was even politically rehabilitated through JFK.

There was an opportunity to end the movie on some more hopeful themes, but I guess nihilism is more fun. 

That said I loved this movie, and every single character. RDJ killed it as Strauss.",2023-07-23 05:23:13

"Before watching the movie: I did read how much money went into practical effects for the bomb-test.

After watching the movie today: the test-scene was pretty much like 30secs at best and the scenes in the trailer looked better than in the movie? Why the fuzz about the effects if 99% of the movie are talking? I give the movie a 6/10, sound is 8/10 (Tenet was like a 2/10) :)

I really expected to see more than just a big boom. They even didn't include those tiny explosions you see on actual testfootage filmed on highspeed-film. What a bummer.",2023-07-23 20:26:18
"I loved it, and thinks thats best Nolan movie.

I also really enjoyed the procedural court room-esque 3rd act that some people I've seen on social media are saying drags on a bit. Overall, this is a very dialogue heavy movie, with incredible performances, sound, and editing. I can't wait to see what Nolan does next (Bond?).",2023-07-21 16:40:38

"This movie was really good. The cast from top to bottom was impressive. Cillian Murphy commanded your attention and was so captivating as the lead. Robert Downey Jr. also showed why he’s a talented actor beyond just blockbusters. As much as I love Iron Man and his Sherlock Holmes, it’s nice to see him return to dramatic work. Also Emily Blunt was sooo good in the last act. Made me wish she got more to do. I also wish Florence Pugh had more meat on the bone as well. Really loved how the film wasn’t about a triumphant sense of accomplishment about making a great scientific advancement. It was about the pressures that basically guaranteed that nuclear weapons would be created and how Oppenheimer has to wrestle with the weight of forces beyond his control. Truly it shows that human progress is a process of standing on your predecessors’ shoulders and how every little discovery funnels civilization down to the path that we know today. In some ways the nuclear arms race was fueled by forces beyond our control, and we have to deal with our own complicity and responsibility within that system. The ending shot was so effective.

Barbenheimer was such a fun time at the theater.",2023-07-21 21:57:57

2. The Soundtrack: I was absolutely stunned! Lmao, I'm so impressed that this was so well done inspite of not being done by the Nolan-Zimmer duo. Batshit crazy nut.",2023-07-22 04:48:59
I wonder why Nolan chose not to show Nagasaki or Hiroshima. Maybe out of respect? Or maybe it would have been too violent? I think this movie could have been more powerful if it showed the consequences.,2023-07-22 06:00:46

It was amazing how he became gradually more and more unlikable over the course of the film, to finally getting what he deserved right at the end.",2023-07-22 13:48:46
I need to re-watch this with subtitles. I felt like I didn't fully understand the plot because if you missed one line of dialog you were screwed and it was hard to follow 5 time lines at once. I also felt it was way too long and could have been 30 minutes shorter. I didn't get that normal payoff you get when you finish a movie and woke up today thinking I didn't really enjoy it that much. It seems I'm in the minority and maybe a second viewing would change my view.,2023-07-22 18:49:20

"Thought the movie was brilliant, definitely worth the 3 hour runtime it's just packed with great dialog, amazing soundtrack and stunning visuals and a very  worrying message. The actors did all an amazing job, everyone used their screen time to the fullest,for example,Rami Malek only had one really important scene in the movie and he just nailed it. Also really liked the use of black and white for Strauss's perspective and a colored one for Oppenheimer and I really enjoyed the way the movie told his life before creating the atomic bomb and showing how intelligent, quick learning yet quite difficult at the same time, his life during the creation of the bomb which was a very stressful experience and had many situations that definitely pushed Oppenheimer to the limit, and his life after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings filled with political drama and agendas from people he knew for years and the emotions of guilt, regret and also fear but also maybe pride for being that one person who changed the world completely, also the ending was extremely powerful seeing an old Oppenheimer after his whole very stressful, even tragic life sitting and shaking hands with people who ultimately played a part in his demise as a person and as a figure.

the loudest movie I have ever seen my lord,2023-07-28 13:17:02
"Came for Cillian Murphy in the lead, stayed for another Nolan favorite.

I really enjoyed it. I honestly wasn't expecting any less and I'm glad it met my expectations. All the cast fit right into their roles in my opinion. DeHaan damn well surprised me, wish we could have seen more of his character. He, Rami Malek and Josh Peck were the last people I expected to see in a Nolan film. I came to this movie with barely any knowledge about the cast aside from main players Cillian, RDJ, Damon and Emily Blunt. So throughout the movie I was pleasantly surprised to see so many familiar faces. Trust Nolan to gather a unique league of actors you never thought you would see together in the same movie. 

I do agree with others that some things felt a little bit fast-paced. I think I need to rewatch the movie just to let some things better sink in. I believe this is Nolan's first biopic, and I think he did fantastic overall.

I saw it in IMAX and couldn't help but feel like I was missing something experience-wise. This was my first IMAX experience and 3rd theatre visit in a long time too, so I wouldn't know the difference. I honestly just blamed it on our ""not so ideal"" seating as we were rather close to the screen. I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a ""3D"" effect there somewhere? The sound system was awesome though, and served the booming of explosions really well. 

The sound design was phenomenal, the way it's used to both enhance the plot and to give insight into Oppie's conflicted thoughts and later PTSD along with Nolan's trademark juxtaposition was done really well. I got Intersteller vibes from some of the scenes and I wasn't at all complaining. The score was brilliant, but that's sort of a given with Nolan films.",2023-07-29 14:51:09

And it’s kind of scary to think about, and how we stand on the shoulders of people who led us to this advancement in science, in history. I’m not saying that we might be the faces, the minds of the future science, but maybe one day, we might have to take part of something, some advancement or tech that might not always be good, that might destroy more then create.

The Manhattan Project was thousands of people coming together, minds from across the globe and they all had to live with the repercussions of what they created, and it’s scary to think of and what our future work might one day do.",2023-08-02 17:03:47

Just saw the movie and had one thing jumped out at me and made my eye twitch. So during the scene when they are prepping the test bomb and putting the core in it.

"Great movie, absolutely amazing! but the constant screechy violin music in the background of absolutely every scene is really annoying and completely unnecessary.",2023-12-23 21:01:33
"I bet Chris Nolan has never felt a human emotion, but probably thinks human emotion is fascinating. None of the “people” in Oppenheimer made me feel anything. All but the titular character and Strauss are ridiculously one-note. They’re there to spout exposition to move the narrative along. Tragically exemplified by Emily Blunt’s Kitty, who is introduced as a booze hound and, you guessed it, can’t go one scene without alcohol making a clunky appearance. That’s her character! That’s it. But Nolan has never written or directed a great, or even kind of good, woman character. 

But boy, does this move! Edits and scenes are brisk. Too brisk. Nothing breaths, but at least that lends itself to the absurd time constraints of our nerd-Avengers coming together to make the worst invention in the history of human existence. 

The technical filmmaking itself is pretty astounding, as expected. It’s gorgeous to look at. And the actors that are actually allowed to shine, Murphy and RDJ, are exceptional. The narrative is inherently compelling and it’s an entertaining watch, especially the courtroom drama stuff where things can actually slow down. 

But for a movie that can’t decide if its thesis is an insular character study or a legitimate warning of human extinction via nukes - I still didn’t really feel anything either way.",2023-07-21 14:59:19
"This film was made with the sensibilities and aesthetics of an action movie, but it is actually a biography of an American scientist. The carving up of what was a linear life into a confusing collage of rapid cuts back and forth over decades of time made it borderline incoherent, and I saw it having read the book twice. Nolan's fear of being boring made him do all sorts of things that are *clever,* and being clever is the last thing needed in a film with a subject this serious. I went in hoping for the best, but my worst fears were realized. The real Oppenheimer's message was that democracy deserves to have important decisions such as building huge stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction be made by the people. He lobbied for more candor from goverment, and less secrecy, and was destroyed for that. Watching this movie, you'd think it was all a grudge match between Oppie and RDJ. It went much deeper than that. The film also downplayed Oppenheimer's disgust with using the weapon on an enemy that was already defeated. It's just a movie, but it's a shame that the important things about Oppenheimer were buried under a confusing mess of a film.",2023-07-21 16:56:55
"This was a very ambitious movie with several problems plaguing it that I found too hard to ignore. Will try to keep it spoiler-free. First, the positives:

1. Artistry: the movie takes very unique creative liberties in showing Oppenheimer's internal psychological state manifested as external changes to his environment, which I found was very fresh and bold for a Nolan project. The snappy editing, nerve-wracking audio crescendos and quick cuts to particles, strings, explosions, using raindrops on pavement to symbolize the chain reaction of nuclear fission  were all delicious. 



2. Soundtrack: Haunting and imposing, the soundtrack dominates this film. Which is a good thing and a bad thing, as I'll explain in a bit. 



Issues I had: 



1. Structure and pacing: This movie is miserable to sit through on first watch, because you can't infer any sense of structure. The film has a nonlinear narrative which is fine when done well, but here it seemed almost deliberately sabotaged to feel overwhelming, tedious and impossible to track. I couldn't tell what scenes were building to. Couldn't tell if we were approaching, inside or leaving a crescendo moment or low point. Couldn't tell if any given scene was intended to be any given way. It just flows, without identity, from one scene to the next, to the point where I could no longer follow it if I tried. There is no discernible structure to the screenplay. The movie refused to invest itself in any given scene, opting instead to use every scene as a build-up for the next scene - the result being you're trapped in a constant rising tension without any actual payoff at any point (with one or two exceptions). The best analogy for it would be that I felt like I was a passenger in a plane that couldn't land, and was constantly edging closer to water, trying to find a runway that doesn't exist. 



2. Musical interference: Nolan's movies are infamous for the dialogue being hard to hear and this movie is no exception. I was straining to hear what people were saying for most of it. And anyone who has trouble with differing accents of English will have even more trouble. But that's not the only way music interferes. The OST carries across scenes without stopping, and the music is deliberately emotionally ambiguous. The result is that the music doesn't help invoke any particular emotion, nor does it help to bookmark and categorize the movie's narrative. It makes the structure problem even worse because the same track will blow over from one scene, setting and timeline to the next, like it's one giant 3-hour montage instead of an actual sequence of scenes with cohesive structure. 



3. Dialogue: This is my biggest issue with Nolan movies and I was disappointed to see that he hasn't learned yet. All of Nolan's characters are the same character. They all talk the same way. They all use the same cadence, the same verbosity, the same choice of vernacular, the same conversational pace, no matter what's going on or who they are. It's ridiculously distracting once you notice it and it never goes away. The dialogue is the weakest part of this movie. Which doesn't help because the movie is almost non-stop conversations, arguments, discussions and one very bizarre sex scene. 



4. Scope: This film is too ambitious. It tried to do too much, and felt cramped, disjointed and bloated. It tries to be a movie about a young scientist coming to fame for his brilliance. It tries to be a love triangle. It tries to be a story about the atom bomb and the effects of it on Oppenheimer post-war. It tries to be a political smear campaign drama. It's 3 different movies stuffed into one. 



All of these problems make the film almost impossible to sit through, despite the sparks of creativity that sometimes show. Overall, 4/10, would not watch again.",2023-07-21 18:58:10

"I'm still gathering my thoughts on the film, and overall liked it. But I really don't think the third act was needed with Lewis Strauss the way it was told. For me it took away from Oppenheimers inner anxieties and conflicting struggles on what he was building, everyday family issues, and just the increasingly uncertain world due to the war. 
I also felt like the looming thread of the Germans developing a bomb first wasn't as heavy on the charecters as it should have been. By the time the urgency to test the bomb had come up, Hitler was dead.

I definitely walked away feeling a huge weight on my chest from this film. Science and the understanding of it is such a gift that humanity has and this is arguably the biggest example of science used for so much destruction that it creates a forceful and fearful sense of peace.",2023-07-22 17:55:04

Was Oppenheimer vital to the timeline of getting the bombs out there?

"Call me crazy, but:At the end, when Oppenheimer finally reveals what was discussed, he brings the equation up that Edward Teller discovered that could result in catastrophic results from the bomb being used.Did that initial conversation not happen right when Oppenheimer arrived in the beginning of the movie?But then somewhere in the half-way point, it's clearly brought to Oppenheimer's attention by Edward Teller during his lecture, which he then states he will go speak to Einstein about the possibly deadly discovery.

My question is-

How did he bring up the equation with Einstein in the beginning of the movie during their secret conversation, if the equation wasn't discovered till later on by Teller, where he brought it up for the first time in the woods?

I might be confused on something, and if so, please explain, because I thought one of the big shockers at the end was that Oppenheimer knew all along about this equation, said nothing, then acted surprised when Teller found out about it in class, and that sounds silly.

Also as a side note, at 1:28:24, a black gloved hand is rather **covertly** seen coming out of the shot from the back of Jean Tatlocks head as if she was drowned.I discovered there's a bit of controversy behind whether-or-not it was indeed suicide, and want to note Oppenheimer's quick, and ready attempt at his professors life with the cyanide.

I don't think it's too far-fetched to believe he had something to do with her death, and the reports that she didn't take enough to technically be lethal...",2023-07-24 06:12:02

"Is the regular screen (Non-IMAX) aspect ratio supposed to be window-box-like cropping when projected? To me, it looks like a floating rectangle with dead area on all four sides. Is this normal for a regular screen showing of Oppenheimer?

Letterboxing on all four sides on a rectangular screen is strange.",2023-07-26 02:39:50

It definitely was a little long, and idk I wish we got to see more of the scientists interacting and stuff, although i dont know shit about quantum mechanics or bombs their interactions were really exciting to me.

"Movie was good, cast was great, thought Nolan did a good job pacing out the movie considering how much he was trying to pack in

Almost felt like 3 hours wasn’t enough and Nolan just hopes no one left for a pee break because every scene seems essential for the overall story 

-I do feel like I would’ve preferred this as a short series on HBO

-the bomb itself was kind of just what you expect, a bomb to look like don’t think you need to see it on any special screen, explosive fire in slow motion will look like explosive fire in slow motion on any screen 

-some scenes played with sound and that was very cool but again, no sounds out of the ordinary that makes you go “only surround sound can achieve that” 


Great movie, I would recommend to friends who haven’t seen it",2023-07-28 14:21:44
"The opening half-hour felt like they were trying to cram the backstory to get to the Manhattan project. Then everything during Los Alamos had a good pace, then after the bomb went off it was sprinting again. 



The explosion was great sound wise, not so much visually. The explosion was beautiful and I think they could have benefited from letting it's beauty speak rather than the quick cuts to the public, then the boom, then Oppy, then the boom. 




Nolan really indulged on sound loudness with this one. I mean his soundtracks are fucking great but damn bro...take a chill pill, my ears need a break.",2023-07-30 23:39:43
"I found Oppenheimer to be too unlikeable, so it took me a bit to realise I'm meant to be rooting for Oppenheimer rather than against him, with the whole Strauss thing.

There should have been more focus on Oppenheimer seeking redemption, soul searching, and perhaps introduce the destroyer of worlds passage here, rather than in a sex scene. A more visible change in him, although they did a good job during the speech showing his internal turmoil. Also if they made Strauss appear more of a slimy, petty character sooner rather than trying to have it as a reveal when it's already obvious it's Strauss pulling the strings; I'd have gotten on Oppie's side more readily, like it felt I was supposed to.",2023-08-06 09:39:14
"Cinematography and acting were great. 

However, the movie itself is structurally all over the place. The pacing was jarring. The fast editing felt out of place. I felt like I was watching a continuous montage. None of the scenes felt like they had a chance to breathe. The constant build up of urgency and tension never seems to pay off and resolve in a convincing or satisfying way. The jumping between different points in time did nothing to enhance the movie and only made it more confusing. Too many characters to keep track of.  

The last act of Oppenheimer's security hearing was arduous to get through. The dialogue got bogged down in legalese. There was also a ton of Adam McKay style exposition, particularly in the scenes with Strauss.   

There were a few interesting moments and themes. But overall I found it to be a disappointing film.",2023-07-23 05:28:01
"That script was not good for me. If you had no clue about any of Oppenheimers story I could see it being hard to follow. The score and acting was great but out of the 3 hours there were only about 3 memorable scenes for me (suspense build up for trinity test, gymnasium speech, Einstein talk at the end).

Oppenheimers conflict with Strauss felt so forced. Felt like Nolan went oh no we need a real antagonist to wrap this up? Disappointed in the movie overall",2023-07-21 11:07:12
At last i can scream it at the top of my lungs : OPPENHEIMER IS MEDIOCRE,2023-07-21 10:53:04
"This movie is about communists, physicists, and the American government. If you want to watch a movie about an atomic bomb, look elsewhere. 

The testing of the bomb had a great anticipatory lead up but a disappointing climax. A bit of CGI and better situational references would’ve made the explosion 10 times more intense. It was pretty obvious Nolan decided to blow up a couple tons of TNT and use a forced perspective to make us think it was an atom bomb. 

The fact they did not choose to show the bombs being dropped on Nagasaki or Hiroshima or the fallout missed the mark for me. A few scenes of the horrible reality of what a nuclear weapon is capable of doing to civilization would’ve lent way more gravitas to the entire film. 

If you want to watch a film about the nuanced shades of moral grey that Robert Oppenheimer operated in then buckle up.",2023-08-01 15:45:22
"I cannot believe the amount of whiny bastards on Reddit complaining about this movie. “Music was too loud in parts”, “the JFK line was stupid”, “the explosion wasn’t big enough”. All people do now is nitpick the shit out of movies, when there’s not any major problems they’ll find some. Go work for Screen Junkies. 

This was easily the best film of the young decade and maybe the best I’ve seen since The Social Network back in 2010? It’s certainly up there. 

Never did I think I’d watch a 3 hour intimate character study and court room procedural drama made for $100 million in a theater in the middle of July, and I’m so glad I did. Many of Nolan’s films are great but get overhyped, this one deserves every word of praise imaginable.",2023-08-03 04:04:50
"Oppenheimer is a movie about “smart” people made for a stupid audience. This movie was a three hour cringe/snooze fest that wasn’t worth the price of admission and did not deliver the overhyped promises that have been promoted for months. I expect it’s going to make a box office splash this weekend and fizzle out.

1) Everything about the true story was oversimplified and yet the film manages to over complicate the delivery. If you go in not knowing anything about what happened at Los Alamos you might come away feeling like you “get it”, but if you go in with any information at all you’ll be struck by how hollow the storyline is and how much truly fascinating stuff they left out.

2) This movie should have been a miniseries and not a three hour flick. The most interesting stories didn’t end up on the screen. For instance, did anyone catch the whole thing about the volume of babies being born at Los Alamos? There is nothing about the very weird social life at LANL, for instance. 

Each scientist gets a two minute cameo but they don’t do anything on screen. Thats not totally true, I guess, Teller sweats a lot. The science also somehow seems unimportant in this movie. People wooed when Einstein came on screen initially, but he wasn’t really featured, nor were his ideas. None of them or their ideas were. None of them seemed to matter and felt like Marvel Movie superheroes. There was a chance for Nolan to show the physics through film that could have been amazing, but instead we just get never ending poorly written dialogue that goes nowhere.

3) Oppenheimer’s character is made to seem like a linguistic pedant (I read Das Kapital in German!) but there is no commentary about the fact that he technically misquoted The Bhagwat Geeta and didn’t actually capture the Hindu meaning. That sex scene where the book is brought out is horribly disrespectful and unnecessary. I was expecting his studies of Hindu religion and philosophy to be explored— maybe he’d have a vision of Vishnu or Siva? Maybe Hindu tests would actually be important? Nah, let’s just show titties.

4) The dialogue was a cringe fest. It was really bad. 

5) The explosion was a let down.

Overall that was a waste of time and money. It’s fine, j guess, but I don’t think it’s a very good movie and it did not live up to its hype.",2023-07-21 15:18:16

am i the only one who felt like that scene with Emily Blunt was fantastic? she did such a good job I wish they gave her more of a role.,2023-07-21 17:44:30
"I think the explosion itself ruined the movie for me. It was build up with this powerful theme of being the most scary thing humans had ever done, yet the explosion just looked like a big gas station blowing up. I also hoped we would have seen fear in peoples eyes as they saw what a nuclear explosion looks like, and the scale of it, compared to regular explosions. It's vastly different in many ways, and I think it should have been made with CGI or maybe a combination, to really emphasize the impact it had. I also wish we had seen it from a birds perspective to give a sense of scale.

I mean, they even had a scene where he shows the biggest chemical explosion ever (the ship), and then explains how a nuclear bomb is way more powerful than that. Yet they use a chemical explosion in the movie as a nuke. That was a let down for me tbh.  
I wasn't a big fan of the multiple timelines, with constant dramatic music back and forth. There was no rythm to the movie and it all seemed unsorted and random. That's probably why I didn't really like Dunkirk either.

I also think that the movie is too fast paced. It never really slows down, except a couple of times, so it's just one long bombardment of information and names to remember, combined with the jumping in time.

But other than that I think it was a crazy beautiful movie both visually and audibly. Would I see it again? Yes, but at home where I can take my time watching it.",2023-07-22 00:26:33
"A Frankenstein story that calls attention to the door opened by our entry into the Atomic age, the time where the miniscus between reality and impossibility collapsed and humanity looked in the mirror and saw a death more complete than anything before. This was an American story that highlights both the American courage to press on where no one has before and the American arrogance to push too far and never look back. And we truly never did, the tools that could end everything we've ever built, all of our little toys and scribblings sits littering the surface. The totality of death held by the few.

I don't think enough has been said by any
voice loud enough for the resounding guilt our culture should feel not just for the people of Nagasaki and Hiroshima but the rest of the world. The Nuclear Age has ended any real sovereignty, to this day we sit in a Mexican standoff such that protects not only our seemingly enlightened exceptionalism but our increasing unhinged despotism. If there were no nukes would Ukraine be in it's current position?

Oppenheimer was a patsy for the world that we all made.

This film should be seen as an indictment against anyone who speaks just quietly enough that you hear something being said but not quite what until too late. It was the centrism and inertia of the post-surrender Alamo scientists that brought us here. But as they have said on both sides, they were simply following orders doing what would've been done without them.

Nolan has pierced the surface past what can be seen as tangible reality and entered the loose coagulation of sense and memory that is the human experience. This film was not perfect but it marks new territory for the medium as Dunkirk and Tenet both did, vollying a barrage of grandiose imagery, carefully balanced color, memorious editing and all encompassing sound. It's something that you just see if you are invested in popular cinema.",2023-07-22 02:48:42
Robert Downey Jr. deserves an Oscar.  The way I hated this person was beyond belief.  Amazing acting 🎭,2023-07-22 03:12:11
Worth seeing in IMAX just for Cillian Murphy’s dreamy blue eyes.,2023-07-22 04:28:48
"Yeah I just watched Cillian Murphy win his Oscar. Brilliant, Nolan did it again. 

I thought the comparisons to The Social Network were kind of off -- choppy quick dialogue with court hearing drama, sure, but otherwise totally different -- and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the clear political message of how McCarthyism was the mechanism through which the main scientist behind the atomic bomb was denied a hand in shaping nuclear safety/regulation/policy post-WW2. It's obviously anti-surveillance as well. 

I have to admit I wasn't as impressed by Downey as early reviews were -- I'm sure he'll get an Oscar nom but I haven't seen Barbie and don't know if it's a lock -- but I thought Emily Blunt was fantastic and stole every scene she was in, particularly towards the end.

But what a score, what great pacing, better sound mixing than Nolan usually has, the visuals, acting, story, everything. I thought I'd be prepared for anything but that scene when Oppenheimer gives to the speech to the people on the bleachers really was haunting. And he always nails his endings.",2023-07-22 11:50:13

"Alright, 11k comments in this thread, and I’m not gonna lie I read a lot of them before seeing it, and a lot have said it’s not that great or it’s boring. So going into it I had to lower my expectations because of what I read here. 

Sure, there’s glaring issues with some of the editing and pacing of it, and the last hour with the hearings is slow as fuck, but honestly, I actually enjoyed the hell out of it. The point leading up to the trinity test and the part just after it with his speech was pretty crazy, especially him hallucinating the effects of the atomic bomb. 

I’d give it a 7/10. Not the masterpiece lots of people here claim, but it’s also not awful or boring as many others claim (the last hour or so may be boring, but the intro and bomb test parts make up for it imo, if only barely) 

I think this is a reasonable take, and don’t tend to agree with people who go all 10/10 masterpiece for everything, or people who just shit on everything and call it crap and insult those who actually enjoyed it. This was a good movie. Not 10/10 good, not even close, but it’s a good movie nonetheless. That’s about it.",2023-07-24 02:56:04
"The trinity sequence was beautiful, ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"" hit so hard there are no words to describe the sensation that moment, truly one of the best scenes this year, probably ever.

The rest of the movie was fine, I loved how they were telling the story through various time periods and somehow making it work. Aside from that it was good, maybe not the best but it was more than fine. Hard to follow sometimes but good enough.",2023-07-24 04:36:16
"I thought it played out more or less how I thought it would, 3-hour long biography centered around a 'trial' so to speak a-la The Social Network. It was a good film but as others are saying I expected more out of the explosion. I also dislike the exposition Nolan just puts in his films out of nowhere, laughable moments for me but enjoyable film.",2023-07-25 04:55:54
"7.5 out of 10. I'm a bit less harsh on the film than many. Sound mixing was uneven. Bomb scene was good. I think the pacing and plot issues were an attempt to maintain the film as a ""popcorn flick"" and for that I admire it, even if I think it wasn't completely successful.

The third act, for me, was an issue. I might get flamed for this but I think much of his ""trial"" scene could have been contracted into a montage that ended with Kitty's testimony in regular time. Same with much of RDJ's hearing with the exception of Rami Malek's monologue. Much of the third act could have been shown to us, rather than painstakingly expositioned. Let's be honest, the bomb was the big scene, and I think we needed to get through the Truman scene, the Malek scene, the Kitty scene, and the Einstein scene and that's it. 

Everything else could have been montage style/sped up.",2023-07-25 14:55:57
"I honestly enjoyed the movie and would still rate it a 8 or 8.5/10, but it could’ve easily been one of if not the greatest character study in film had it focused solely on Oppenheimer’s optimistic creation of the bomb and the harrowing aftermath of it’s completion. Like the scene where he had a panic attack was perfect because it capitalized how distraught he was with his actions at that moment.

The recognition, The Time Magazine, him being labeled “The Father of the Atomic Bomb”. From an external standpoint he’s famous and widely known almost like a God, but from an internal standpoint he has so much guilt over what he’s done as the Creator. It’s quite the juxtaposition. I honestly don’t care about him being accused as a communist and getting his security clearance revoked. The sole focus should’ve been on his internal conflict, struggling with the fact that he caused the death and destruction of hundreds of thousands.",2023-07-25 16:43:26
I don't get all the talk/marketing pushing this is a movie you must watch in IMAX. There were like 2 or 3 scenes that I think would benefit from a huge screen like that,2023-07-26 00:28:52
"brilliant film.

Not his magnum opus, not interstellar/inception heights but damn close

needs subtitles though. I was the only one to laugh at some of the jokes because I was probably one of the few to actually hear it",2023-07-26 10:33:23
I’ll get downvoted for this but Oppenheimer was way too long and I lost interest after they dropped the bomb.,2023-07-22 09:54:11
"Movie was excellent up to the news of the bombing in Japan. Then i really felt the runtime.. it could have been shorter. Also even with the length, the entire movie felt one continuous montage, because of how quickly scenes cut from one to the other, and the intense music never seemed to stop which was almost jarring. I actually had trouble following what was happening at points. Everyones acting was top notch, the sound design and score was amazing, the visual depiction of the atoms colliding in Oppenhiemers brain was very unique and engaging. Plenty good about this movie, but certainly not Nolan's best.",2023-07-21 12:44:06
Its kinda poetic how Strauss and oppenheimer disagreed on how to handle Russia vs USA nuclear threat and Strauss wanted the mutually assured destruction option. It’s kinda poetic/ironic considering him destroying oppenheimer also ended up destroying his own legacy,2023-07-21 17:32:53
"I think it could easily be Nolan's best work imo, the tension was done amazingly well towards the end and I loved the way the non linear storytelling was done and the way they were overlapping with each other and recontextualising events that were shown multiple times. The scene where Oppenheimer was giving that speech to the crowd after the bomb was dropped and was imagining them being killed in the blast was haunting as fuck (especially as I've been to the Peace Museum in Hiroshima and having that added context and weight behind Oppenheimer's guilt made it hit even harder), and that final conversation with Einstein is probably one of the most awesome endings I've ever seen to a film. It has not left my mind since I finished watching it, I even watched Barbie after and while it was a fun distraction my mind went straight back to Oppenheimer after it was over. 10/10.",2023-07-21 22:27:59
"I loved it. Cillian Murphy absolutely killed it. 

I wasn't expecting a huge people drama part to it but I think that added to the film for me. Because at the end of the day, policies and the people who make them get there by squabbling and infighting and turning on each other. It really made the point that the people who make decisions about nuclear weapons or how they get used aren't always people who are rising through the government to be selfless. It's people who hold grudges, backstab and are petty. The best person for a position doesn't always get the job, or loses it because of a personal vendetta. 

Science would dictate all those types of decisions are made on a purely facts based level. But they aren't, the human element complicates things. Once the ""do or die"" aspect of a pending war was removed and urgency faded, choices about who lead what and who did what became humanized. 

It's not meant to just be a biography or a story about the atom bomb. It's about how we approach nuclear weapons, how we make decisions about them and how the people who ultimately make those choices get to the position of making those choices. Really shines a light on the difference between those who make a bomb possible and those who choose to use it.

Also, this is small and nit-picking but I really liked the little animations they did for his school days. Thought they added to showing how his mind worked and wished they had brought them back more during the 2nd act and leading up to the trinity test.

The music was fantastic too. It's so immersive and full of feelings. I absolutely can hear a theme and thought the composer, Göransson, did a good job. He's also worked on The Mandalorian and really gave the film a theme.

The silence after detonation while the spectators wait for the sound wave/shock wave to hit was excellent. Those tense seconds that lead into the ""what have we done"" and ""shit it worked"" to getting the full force of the blast. It's one thing to see a blast, it's another to feel it.",2023-07-22 03:03:10
"Seeing a lot of people complaining about the women being underdeveloped. Do people really not know how women were treated in the 50s or do they just like to talk out of their ass?

Not only that but Jean and Kitty’s characters were performed spot on by Florence and Emily. You completely felt the guilt and depression consuming Jean. Emily Blunt also nailed Kitty’s character to a tee. A brilliant biologist who’s succumbed to be a housewife while also being a pretty shitty person in general but extremely loyal. Hate when people say they’re underdeveloped when they’re just women in patriarchal times.",2023-07-22 03:36:45
"Decent movie, definitely felt like it's been played up a bit and will fall down the pecking order of Nolan films once some time has passed but it's definitely an experience. 

Also, I found RDJ's performance to be a bit overrated since I was expecting a lot based on what I'd read before going in and felt like him being behind Boden's access to the file was super obvious. I found Florence Pugh's performance to be a bit underrated. I haven't seen a lot of her movies but was quite impressed with her.",2023-07-22 16:11:12
"a great movie, but it felt mentally exhausting to have 3 hours of almost-unbroken Nolan-style filmmaking (tense music, lots of tiny scenes in rapid fire). IIRC the only real breaks in the tension were the detonation (incredible scene) and the final conversation with Edison. It's a style that works in some situations but on this movie it was too much.",2023-07-22 18:06:40
"of all the ways in which my religion was represented in IMAX, I did not expect to see Florence Pugh topless and forcing Cillian Murphy to read scripture during insertion to be one of them. Quite the emotionally confusing scene, to put it lightly.

I wonder what my mother, a religious scholar, would think of that scene",2023-07-23 19:09:57
"I personally loved that Nolan portrayed Harry S. Truman as the weak, conniving and insecure piece of shit that he was. 

Henry Wallace would have never dropped those bombs.",2023-07-23 20:52:43
"It has been a few days since I saw the film, but I was slightly disappointed with it. I was bored, nay, unfocused throughout its runtime, like it kept jumping back and forth very unnecessarily. The first sex scene was completely unnecessary, and borderline blasphemous, and the whole Strauss thing, the black-and-white stuff was completely unnecessary, considering the fact that we are there for Oppenheimer, and not Oppenheimer-Strauss. Don't get me wrong, RDJ was brilliant, but it was written pretty poorly, it reminded me of the Pixar movie villains. Like, Strauss' opposition to Oppenheimer seemed so bloody trivial from what the movie showed, perhaps these could be relegated to the background and focus more on Oppenheimer (like it bloody should?). I'd probably read the novel the film is based on for better understanding of what happened... Perhaps that might clear up some of my criticisms... For now, this is one of Nolan's weaker films for me... Perhaps lower than Dark Knight Rises and Dunkirk (I didn't really like that one)",2023-07-24 16:32:19
"Was anyone else completely lost throughout the whole movie? I was, I just couldn't enjoy the movie because I had no idea what was going on. Maybe it's just me, but the constant back and forth between his interrogation and his life confused me. Come to think of it, I had no idea what his trial was even about. I also don't know what Lewis Strauss was doing, the movie seemed to be saying that his character and what he did was important but it just went completely over my head. Until someone comes and changes my mind, 3/10.",2023-07-24 17:34:02
"Anyone else think that Rami’s character giving the testimony at the end was anti climactic? Should have been one of the most dramatic moments of the film, but it’s impact was lost because the viewers have no connection with that character

I’m glad Nolan didn’t waste Rami, but we should have had some build up to what essentially functioned as a plot twist",2023-07-24 18:00:20
"I thought the film looked and sounded great, acting is on point, but the screenplay...ugh.The movie covers most of Oppenheimer's life, but it's mostly ankle deep.  All the base stuff is covered- where he studied, where he worked, his relationships ( the most solid part of all, i think), but we almost never get to see what he really thinks or feels.He's pretty passionate about socialist cause, i guess. But then he gets opportunity to head Manhattan project, and that stuff is forgotten. Why does he decide to join, anyway? Is it ambition, scientific interest, patriotism? We don't have any inner dialogue, and all we hear from the man himself are a few noncommittal phrases like ""well we must have it before the nazis"". How did his attitude change through the project? We see people with pretty clear stances, but only see Oppenheimer playing politics and floating between camps. He's pretty horrified after the bombing, ok, but not much else is clearly shown. And it's not a complex character displayed - it's more like guessing politician's character from his speeches.

I don't get what the film is really about. We don't get to see much the inner world of titular character,  science and engineering marvel and brilliant people around Manhattan project are largely grazed over, ethics is left at ""bomb bad, but what can you do"", but there's a looooot of hearings. In  a 3 hour movie it feels there is not enough time to dive deeply into anything, but we get 40 minute subplot of whether Strauss can get the post he really wants. Is it really necessary? The emotional climax of the movie is scheming politician getting some karmic justice in the form of getting a slap on the hand.

It's not a bad movie. There are many cool shots - Oppenheimer with the bomb, a lot of Jean scenes, trinity test, but the emotional core feels kinda hollow, we don't really get to know the man who the film is about, and so much of important themes are just grazed without any deep exploration.  Feels like Nolan tried to fit way to much into one movie, and didn't manage to really fit anything substantial.",2023-07-26 20:55:43
"Great movie, but holy shit the constant music was fucking infuriating. We don't need suspense music going on the entire time.

Seems like a lot of the negative reviewers in here were expecting a boom-boom exciting war movie and not a biopic about a scientist.,2023-07-22 00:43:08
"I hope the editor got a sack of money for this one. I don’t think we had one long cut in this movie.

The technical aspects of the movie were great, but I think Nolan needs someone to focus him in. This went a little overboard on Strauss.  Its going to get some Oscar nominations.

I buy many physical copies of Nolan movies, but this is one I think I’ll skip. I don’t see myself wanting to see it again. I am glad I saw it in theaters. It’s one of the better movies I’ve seen this summer.…but if I had to see Oppy or MI:7 again, I’m seeing MI:7.",2023-07-22 04:18:37
"I really wanted to love this movie but it just had too many issues, the run time maybe the biggest one, I can't think of any movie that's earned a 3 hour runtime except Fiddler on the Roof; at that length turn it into a mini series, after Chernobyl I think HBO would have done a better job. It just gets too boring, people took out their phones in my theater, people fell asleep, etc.

Second biggest mistake might have been focusing so much on Strauss, why do we care if Strauss gets to be secretary of commerce(?) or not if they're worried about a world ending arms race and ever more powerful weapons? The payoff of the third act felt totally inconsequential, with the weird time jumping (and also switching to and from black and white, why?) I think we already knew he was another Einstein right? Basically informally influential but totally out of date in terms of the science and just working at universities. Clearly his reputation was important to him but it seemed like he was going to end up alright no matter what.

If it went longer into his life and showed how he died during arguably the height of the nuclear arms race and didn't see how his fears of MAD with the soviets never happened it would have been more impactful, but it couldn't decide if it wanted to be about Trinity or a biopic.



And the trinity test itself felt like a letdown. After all the theater shaking sound effects and music, we get a bright fireball, looked cool but I was expecting awesome.",2023-07-23 21:00:46
"If you want to watch a loud explosion as a movie go watch some shitty marvel movie. Or the original footage of the bomb. This movie is NOT about the bomb. Stop complaining about the bomb footage. 

It's about the life of a man who has/had an outsized influence on history. And he wasn't ready for it. That's it. It was a GREAT movie.",2023-08-03 03:37:41
"I think I would have preferred a Coen Brothers interpretation of Oppenheimer. Nolan takes Oppenheimer's perspective too seriously. A look at a Jewish protagonist grappling with the meaning of his ultimately nihilistic and barbaric work. A man learning to fit into a role laid out for him, act out the life that he fell into, gradually learning how to play the part, only for the same political machines that made him to engineer his downfall. A moral examination of how we are all simultaneously actors in history and prisoners of fate, and how we deal with that psychospiritual burden. The Manhattan Project played as a farce, laying bare the detachment with which people can calculate and design the annihilation of lives many thousands of miles away with smiles on their faces, without ever fully grappling with what they've done, until it's too late.

Hell, I'll shell out for movie tickets again for a Coen Brothers remake. I think it'd be good.",2023-08-11 18:12:43
"I found Oppenheimer to be a breathtaking masterpiece. A genuine awe-inspiring experience. Nolan has taken everything he has learned from his previous works and applies it to Oppenheimer, creating a film that is both an epic and one of the most harrowing character studies I have seen. A film that is bombastic and loud, yet also intimate and poignant.

Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. give career best performances. They are both so unbelievably good. I mean really fucking good. The rest of the cast is rounded out by great supporting performances(especially from Emily Blunt and Matt Damon), but where Murphy and Downey Jr. take their performances is something that demands to be seen on the big screen. It is electrifying to watch two of the best actors light up the screen this way. Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is so fully formed and multi-layered. He showcases all the sides of Oppenheimer. His determination, wit, ambition, morality, and guilt. Carrying a film like this is a tall task for any actor, yet Cillian Murphy does it flawlessly. It is a striking performance.

The final hour of the film is unlike anything Christopher Nolan has done in his career and it is mesmerizing. I was so happy with the direction he took the film. Of course the cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is gorgeous, the music by Ludwig Göransson is transcendent, but the real show stopper of this film is not the detonation of a nuclear weapon(though that scene is TREMENDOUS) it's the editing by Jennifer Lame. Oppenheimer is an editing master work. It is perhaps Nolan's most dense and layered film and the amount of pieces that Jennifer Lame juggles seamlessly, is awe-inspiring. And of course as is tradition of a Nolan film, he directs it all with surgical precision and it all comes together in a way that gives you chills. So many moments I'm going to be thinking about for so long.",2023-07-21 06:54:36
"I feel like this was a damn near masterpiece. I’ll have to watch it again. I wish we saw the entire world burn at the end instead of just like a third of it, and maybe even explode sucking all the light in the frame and leaving us in pitch black like the black hole they mention. But then again that wouldn’t make sense at all. 

But man those last words and that shot of him looking on will stay with me. Also love the way the walls shook and the lights got brighter mixed with the music, you can feel the intensity he was feeling",2023-07-21 09:11:02

"I went in sort of blind, although the title of the film should have clued me in to the laser-focus Nolan gave the man himself.  Unfortunately I went in expecting Nolan’s version of “Fat Man and Little Boy,” a great movie from 1989 actually about the Manhattan Project.

Instead, I got a much more biographical film that doesn’t reallu give you any hand-holding. The framing story of Lewis Strauss’s senate confirmation hearing seems am odd choice, and I still I don’t know really who he was (former admiral? Head of the Atomic Energy Commission…? Gonna hit wiki after this), or why I should care if he gets confirmed for Commerce Secretary.

Zero chance your avg movie-goer is going to recognize Bohr, Heisenberg, Fermi, or any of the scientific giants that had small parts in the film. Hell, I was reading the credits before this and discovered the Jack Quaid played Richard fucking Feynman!! Talk about bit parts!

Interesting that no one has ever mentioned it but after JFK was assassinated the following year Lewis Strauss was hugely involved in supporting the presidency campaign for Barry Goldwater. Might sound like a conspiracy theory but was Nolan implying something when Strauss asked the senate names who denied him Secretary of Commerce cabinet position and John Kennedy's name was highlighted?,2023-07-22 09:02:53
This was probably my favourite theatre experience ever. The way Nolan can keep the tension throughout this runtime is extraordinary. Also Nolan really knows how to end his movies because he left my entire packed theatre speechless.,2023-07-22 09:03:06
"Nowadays I tend to go into movies with no expectations but since it was a Nolan Film, there were some expectations to be met. I'm not disappointed or dissatisfied, just a bit underwhelmed by the movie. It was good not great. If I had to give a score, it would have to be 7.5/10. Not his best work imo.",2023-07-22 09:14:54
"If Cillian Murphy doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for this we riot I'm so serious

His acting is amazing like his face says so much without dialogue. The auditorium speech scene or interrogation scenes are highlights to me

My only complaint, really, is the last 10-20 minutes or so. Oppenheimer gets denied and then Strauss gets denied in a similar fashion. I liked that parallel. 

But it didn't tell me what happened next. What is there to do after getting denied? I dunno it felt like an odd way to end the movie. The conversation with Einstein was good but I just felt their stories  could have used a bit more closure",2023-07-23 04:50:24
"Great film that's guaranteed 5-7 Oscar nominations. Nolan always misses on the emotional impact - his films always leave me a bit cold. Ditto here - he didn't build a case for me to care about any of the characters.

Seeing it soon. Is the infamous 'I am become death' speech part of the film?,2023-07-23 06:45:30
"I thought this was an incredible film.
Honestly it didn't feel slow or plodding for a moment of me.
I feel like some people expect this film to be more about the bomb and it's aftermath while this film is more about Oppenheimer and how he (and the world to some degree) are affected by his own creation and how one man brought to the world so much fear and destruction and because of that became one of the most talked about men in modern history.

The reason the courtroom scenes for example were so long (i know some people had a problem with that) is because :
1. at the time it happened it was truly a huge huge deal and should be treated as such, it wasn't just a court case that could be summed up in 5 mins, it was the talk of the year on one of the most controversial men.

2. The film centers around Oppenheimer, not just the bombing, it shows some of the aftermath of the bomb through both Oppenheimer's trauma and through showing how much the world was nearly hypnotized about his case and everything that happens with him Which reflects just how big of an effect the bombing had.

To cut that short, imo would be wrong as it would undermine these points.

Overall i truly loved this film, altho i can get why it's not everyone's cup of tea",2023-07-23 12:46:49
"Nolan's biographical movie on Oppenheimer was truly outstanding. I appreciate his approach in portraying the life of such a remarkable figure. Personally, I hope he continues to explore the stories of unsung heroes like Alan Turing in future projects as well.

"As someone with a degree in physics and a PhD In engineering lots of the movie felt very impactful. They captured a feeling of internal conflict of curiosity and fear in a way I found resonated very well 

To what degree the scientists and engineers are responsible for the ""Genies"" they let out of the bottle I think is something many of us consider/struggle with (not to mention how that interplay with the desire to pursue a questions through to it's solution) and it's not a problem I ever thought I'd see depicted in film let alone so well. I think Cillian's performance really sold this part for me. (As a side note I recommend Liu Cixin's novel Ball lightning to anyone interested in a story with those same themes but more sci-fi)

Overall very much enjoyed it, at the end I was stunned by how captivated I had been by 3 hours of just character dialog. Sex scenes felt well utilized and executed in general except the reading of the book one. I felt like they really wanted the ""become death"" quote for emotional impact later on but it didn't really work for me. But I also think the later sex scene which was very effective doesn't work as well without it so 50/50 on that one.",2023-07-27 13:23:49
"I overall really liked the movie, but I did not like the beginning. The pacing was too fast at first and I felt like the point was that Oppenheimer was such a genius and amazing and above all he fuckssss... Then it seemed to lose this fast pace vibe and stopped trying to sell me on how amazing he was (and that he fuckssss) and all the characters started becoming more interesting and developed.

The last two thirds I was way more invested but the first act I really did not like the choices Nolan made. I'd still recommend it.",2023-07-30 03:41:13

"I saw this last night. I was confused about the end.

&#x200B;

**So, obviously: spoilers ahead!**

At the end of the movie we see Strauss remembering the time Oppenheimer ""*poisoned Einstein against him*"". 

He is then questioned about the possibility that they weren't even talking about him.

We then go back to see what they actualy said to each other, and Oppenheimer says to Einstein>! if he remembers the time he showed him the calculations according to which a nuclear explosion could start a chain reaction that would set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the world!<.

My problem with this is.... wasn't this moment (when we see for the first time Oppenheimer talk to Einstein in the campus, back at the beggining of the movie) way before they are even summoned to the manhattan project?

&#x200B;

IIRC, in the commision against him, Oppenheimer gets questioned about why didn't he studied in certain university in the USA, his answer is that he founded that university.

Then he has a flashback to when He came back from Europe and is invited by Strauss.

He (Strauss) says Oppenheimer is the only physicist in USA devoted to quantum physics.

Also in this university he has the first pupil, so he isn't yet renowed (as the father of the Atomic bomb, at least). So how could have they, at the time, remember something that didn't happen yet?

Also, I didn't understand the significance that one of the senators that voted against Strauss was John F. Kennedy.",2023-08-09 14:59:13
I found this to be my favourite of the year so far. Only complaint is that the noise is too high at points where it need not be so loud.,2023-08-23 01:53:21
"I've just watched the film for the first time. Sadly no IMAX and dubbed in Italian, although with a good dubbing. The acting was still great despite not being able to appreciate it fully, I'll rewatch it in English soon.

The film is great, really spectacular. I'd not say it's Nolan's greatest, because The Prestige seems to have been his peak and Dunkirk, Memento and the Dark Knight are just as close, but it's amazing.

The plot was well built, the initial hidden dialogue with Einstein revealed in the ending (it was quite obvious what it was about for everyone who knew their history, but still built well). The POV structure with the use of B/W for Strauss' scenes was an excellent choice. The sex scene weren't overdone and the one during the interrogation by Kitty's POV, despite being very obviously explicit and called, was good.

The Trinity test scene was amazing despite not being able to rival the real explosion obviously, only the seemingly lack of journalists on the spot is a bit of an imprecision.

The buildup to the moral dilemma, his shift of beliefs and convictions was done quite well, although it would have been better in context with expansion to Einstein, Fermi, Rotblat and Szilard's opposition either to the development of the H-bomb after Enola Gay or to the use of the Atomics altogether.

Another little quirk is the scene that depicts Einstein and Gödel, which the general public won't recognise despite being one of the greatest mathematicians and logician of the XX century. There are some nice elements taken from real life, like him and Einstein having strolls while discussing science and philosophy, his love for trees and his refusal to eat which led to his death, but from that short scene he comes across as a non important and ""slow"" old man, which is quite unfair as a portrayal. The same is for some Einstein's scenes, especially the one where he appears behind the taxy by surprise, a little over dramatic.",2023-08-30 00:40:58
I feel like the 11 miles of imax film thing is incredibly wasteful there was only really one scene for it 99% of the movie was just people talking.,2023-07-21 11:26:15
"Didn't enjoy it  
The story is interesting but I don't think it was edited/written well. It felt messy and boring.

I've seen comparisons written how they wish it was shorter and more like ""The Imitation Game"" and I agree. A focus primarily on the war and manhattan project would have been more entertaining. I frankly couldn't care less about his security clearance issues or his affair.",2023-11-29 07:44:42
"Pretentious hollow rubbish. Boring, over long, convinced if its own importance, and suffering from a total lack of narrative flow or characterisation. Watch as reviewers and fans try to get both veg and the meat in they mouth. Here is a naked emperor with an army of sycophants. There are good bits, the subject, the ending, etc. But this is a boring wordy mess, that taught me nothing much about the central character and nothing at all about the actual process. Scam.",2023-07-22 03:33:09
"Hot take.
Oppenheimer wasn’t good everyone is just caught in the marketing.",2023-07-24 04:12:39
"I felt nothing watching this , the movie just jumps here and there then here then there etc the flow was all over the place 

The relationship between Cillian and Emily was also poorly done again scenes just dropping in out of nowhere where they talk then back to the main plot I felt nothing for the relationship with her or Florence’s character 

There was zero emotional attachment to this character for me 

The best chunk of the movie was in the middle when los alamos was in full swing and they where gearing up to the trinity test I think shorting this down to 2 hours would have benefited because that last 40m draaaaaggedd",2023-07-30 16:51:16
I guess I’m in the minority in that I didn’t like it.   It was way too long and didn’t need to be 3 hours.  By the end I was ready to go.,2023-08-04 17:02:37
"Movie was great, but the bomb was a tiny bit underwhelming. I think Nolan's refusal to use CGI was more of a detriment than a benefit when it came to the explosion itself.",2023-07-21 02:20:03
"Film was decent but I wish they would have included some and taken out some scenes .


- there really was no need for the sex scenes as they added nothing to the story . The dialog alone was enough to let us know she has mental issues. Especially during the closed hearing .

- they really should have gone all out for the explosion as it looked nothing like the historical footage 

- they should have shown the aftermath of Japan since he went on a whole spew about what they had done .

They missed his most important speech about being death and later on another speech before he died .",2023-07-21 16:07:24
"I'll be brief : It was a good movie. Nothing remotely extraordinary though. Infact nothing on Nolan's past work. If script is king, he's had better ones. Its a pretty alright biopic with standout moments in a non-linear setting. The women dont really get to do much. Pugh is completely wasted. Blunt steals every scene she's in. RDJ,Damon and Safdie are spectacular. The former is winning the best supporting actor Oscar. Cillian is great but somehow even after 3 hours watching him be central figure.. I feel like we didnt get enough of him and his range. I wonder if anyone else feels the same.",2023-07-21 22:36:00
"I personally thought it was a good movie, but I didn’t like the huge focus on whether or not Oppenheimer was a communist… to me it diluted the emotional impact of the movie and diverted too much from the subject matter. At the end they revoke his security clearance… I mean are we supposed to feel bad? Who gives a shit?",2023-07-22 13:40:55
Why didn’t I like it :(,2023-07-22 16:32:14
wonder how many people are going to get like halfway through Oppenheimer and realize that they liked the idea of watching it more than they actually like watching it.,2023-07-23 03:33:31
"I felt like 20% of this movie was absolutely brilliant, but the remaining 80% unfortunately rather dull. Had it been 30-45 minutes shorter, I would have said it was a much better movie.

Obviously the Communist accusations and security clearance aspects were important parts of Oppenheimer's life, and absolutely needed to be addressed in some way, but I felt those scenes were too repetitive and went on for much too long - not to mention delivered over monotonous foreboding music that was too liberally applied. 

I really wanted the camera to get out of that tiny room and see some magnificent landscapes and epic cinematic moments, but instead we obsessed over bland legal arguments that just frankly aren't that important or interesting to someone watching this decades later. After the Trinity test (which I thought was incredible), basically the entire rest of the movie was devoted to this relatively dull and irrelevant plot point - Wikipedia is a better medium than cinema for all the detail.

At least there was some payoff at the end. The crux of the storyline rested on what was said between Oppenheimer and Einstein by the lake, and this was revealed marvellously, but my goodness it took a lot of time and dialogue between men in suits to get there.",2023-07-23 09:01:16
"Too many people in this thread wanted this to be ‘Atomic Bomb’ the movie, not Oppenheimer. We were never going to get grisly footage of bomb results or actually see what happened in Japan, and the fact that so many people eagerly wanted to see that terrifies me. What we got was perfect, those anxiety scenes are more effective than watching some random people get vaporized",2023-07-23 14:31:48
"Maybe I was just propagandized by my American education, but I was always lead to believe the end of WW2 went:

Nuclear bombs dropped 

Japan surrenders

Hitler suicides

Germany surrenders

It actually blew my mind that Hitler had been dead for *months* before the bombs were dropped in Japan. Just the realization that they could’ve stopped because there was no more danger of the Nazis building their own bomb, and Japan was more than likely far more vulnerable now with no allies left, without the necessary force of two whole nuclear bombs, what a goddamn gut punch

Edit: I should clarify, a large portion of my history education took place from 2001-2010 in post-9/11 NYC, so maybe some details were withheld to not villainize the US in a very jingoistic era an hour away from Ground Zero 😅",2023-07-23 20:08:05
One of the best films I've ever seen,2023-07-25 00:20:57
Great movie but a weird theater experience.  Right when the sound cut out during the bomb test some guy a few rows back ripped a pretty sizable fart.,2023-07-25 04:05:30
"I thought the movie was slightly above mid and def overhyped. If I get spammed for having an opinion, the Russians have won.",2023-07-26 18:02:54
"Absolutely enjoyed this movie but have two main critiques 

1) Florence pugh's tits did not need to be out and the sex wasn't really necessary. 

2) RDJ said he felt like this character pushed him yet I think he's... still playing the same character - himself? He's boisterous, cocky, arrogant, electric and emphatic... just seems like he didn't have to push himself too hard for this role. Thought Matt Damon did great though 

Ps. I don't think this movie passes the bechdel test but since when does CN care lmao",2023-07-28 03:39:17
"Amazing movie but felt pretty dragged out after the trinity test, could have either replaced some scenes with something else or just cut them out.

Loved the visuals, the build up and writing",2023-07-28 19:07:02
"Felt like the movie was far over hyped and I felt it was a good movie but not GREAT. Maybe it missed the mark or something for me but the first act felt far too chaotic and the cuts too frantic. 

I think I took more issue with Oppenheimers character in general. I understand it’s a biopic but he felt incredibly self absorbed and while that might have been the intent to portray him that way I found him insufferable.",2023-07-29 06:04:13
"They needed to do a better job explaining the two different timelines in the beginning. I must have missed a line of dialog or something and was confused throughout. Strauss is not a good character imo, why should we care about him at all?",2023-07-29 14:04:10
"Just saw the movie. I think, by the 2 hour mark, I was sort of diappointed, but the final hour is fantastic and Nolan at his best. That scene with him giving a speech for the Los Alamos crowd after the first bomb was harrowing.

I wish Emily Blunt had a bigger screen time. And they should've focused a little bit more on the sciene of it all too. Still, great movie",2023-08-01 20:24:17
"Good movie, not the masterpiece being claimed though unfortunately. Excellent acting (Murphy, Downey Jr. And blunt are great). Way too long a movie ( about an hour too long); and drags quite a bit at times. 

I’m a huge Nolan fan but prefer his sci-fi/comic (inception, interstellar, tdk) over his historical (Dunkirk, Oppenheimer).",2023-08-14 01:23:05
"I saw Oppenheimer this weekend and while I liked it overall, I also agree with a lot of other people’s criticisms of the film but I think the film had a lot of positives too. 

What I didn’t like:

The score was a bit distracting and distorted the audio so I found the dialogue hard to understand at many points. While I understand the security clearance investigation was critical to Oppenheimer’s life, I would be lying if I said that the way that story line was integrated into the movie around the Manhattan project piece made the three hour long film feel like it was five hours long. A lot of the scenes where people were being questioned about Oppenheimer’s connection to the Communist Party of America were repetitive, drawn out, and boring. I would’ve preferred those parts to have been condensed. 

I also feel like this movie could’ve also just been two separate films or a part one and part two. The first one could be about how Oppenheimer got involved in the Manhattan project and the creation of the atomic bomb and part two could’ve focused on the post-war aftermath and his security clearance trial.

I also felt like some of the timeline of the events was confusing, but again, that may have been because I was exhausted when I watched it. 

What I did like:

The acting was top notch. I was very impressed with the strong performances in the film. There were some truly chilling scenes (I.e. the foot stomping and Oppenheimer stepping into the ash husk of a corpse) that were terrifying, depressing and yet hauntingly beautiful. 

I want to watch this film again when I’m less tired but yeah, I still enjoyed it overall.",2023-08-21 19:58:03
"Yo, this thing was long.",2023-08-27 15:30:29
"I may be alone in this opinion, but did anyone think actual shots of the explosion (not the build up, the build up was incredible) didn’t quite convey the scale and power of the blast? I understand the choice to not use CGI, but the actual imagery of the explosion felt a little small scale to me, compared to real footage of the trinity test.

Anyway, that didn’t detract from the movie at all for me. Incredible film.",2023-07-21 05:57:30
"I think overall it was a good movie but if I’m being completely honest I wasn’t that invested in the first 2 acts. Still good, but I wasn’t really *that* into it. The 3rd act though, was great. 

also my first time seeing a film in 70 mm so that was pretty cool 

probably a 7.5/10 for me",2023-07-21 17:46:48
"Anyone else feel like there were some “Adam and Eve” moments? The odd poisoned apple. The sex scenes and naked dialogue afterwards (they were naked and ashamed).

This movie really drives home that real life is more dystopian than any fiction. We live in a fascist world.,2023-07-22 03:33:44
"It is hard to process any words after seeing this. Just left me with the heaviest of feelings. It has to be up there among Nolan’s very best. I have to rewatch this.

Nolan, Cillian and RDJ are coming for those Oscars.",2023-07-22 07:07:31
"The cinematography was great, sound was great, acting was great. Script was good but the non-stop talking really got to me. 

The majority of the scenes felt like a trailer or a flashback scene with horrible pacing and characters talking immediately after each other in an unrealistic manner.

I definitely need a re-watch but I don’t think the pacing issues will fade. If dialogue was paced correctly the movie would be 4.5 hours long.",2023-07-22 08:54:07
"Saw the film in IMAX today. Really wanted to love it but couldn't quite get there. Murphy, RDJ and Damon all nailed their roles. Great screenplay and cinematography. I thought the story flowed well and was a movie where the audience is respected as the story isnt overtly told, you had to be paying attention to piece it together.

 I found it at times to be a little lackluster... feel like the movie could have been ~30 minutes shorter. Issues with the sound quality and not hearing completely what was said throughout the film and at times it felt oversaturated with background music. Not sure we got much depth out of the story, feel could have been fleshed out further. Overall the movie felt like those times when you buy a nice looking cake from the store and the taste is bland to ok but you keep convincing yourself it tastes as good as it looks... 8/10 for me.",2023-07-23 07:54:20
"I could barely hear a thing. Loved the few scenes without music, like the Trinity test. I missed entire plot beats because of this.

Am I the only one? Was the the sound mixing or the speaker quality at the theater?",2023-07-23 13:55:53
After my second viewing of this film I appreciated its craftsmanship even more. The flawless execution combined with the historical significance of the story it tells makes this an essential film.,2023-07-23 19:18:57
"Just came out of a viewing now. Normal screening cause IMAX and IMAX 70MM is sold out all over Los Angeles.

It's a very good movie from start to finish. Great performances, killer score, editing is on point. It is gonna be nominated for all these awards and it is 100% deserving.

Having said all that: I think they stumbled a bit in the third act with all the courtroom stuff. Now, again, those sections are very good and everyone is giving their all in the performances. But I feel like Oppenheimer going from wanting to build the bomb to having unimaginable regret/PTSD over it should've been the only focal point.

There's a scene during the third act where Kitty is like: ""You can't make everything okay by being a martyr"" and it sums up the third act perfectly. But Robert Downey Jr. wanting to get petty revenge just felt like a completely different movie. Again, what Nolan gives us here in the third act is still pretty good...I just think it makes the movie drag when the end scene involving Einstein telling Oppenheimer that he's fucked the world (essentially) would've been there regardless.

Still worth time seeing although now that I only saw it on a ""standard"" screening I do not see the hubhub about IMAX. Seems like it can stand on its own as long as the theater doesn't fuck up the projection.",2023-07-24 02:32:08
Oppenheimer casually dismissing the possibility that him fucking a colleague's wife might have contributed to his death pretty much killed all my sympathy for him right at the end.,2023-07-24 07:22:53
"This story told on 70mm was a movie experience I’ve never had and will never forget. A biopic of epic proportions and scale, Nolan undoubtedly created a masterpiece.

I am left wondering though…did he miss the opportunity to show the true devastation this bomb caused? Why is it that the only explosion we saw came from Trinity, rather than the ones which wreaked actual human havoc?",2023-07-24 08:45:22
"It's 3 hours long but it still felt rushed, like somebody watched Tim Robinson's *I Think You Should Leave* drive-through sketch and told me Oppenheimer's life story as fast as they could.",2023-07-25 19:02:57
It’s kind of interesting how this movie is getting glowing reviews over here and getting absolutely shitted on over in the true film Reddit.,2023-07-26 05:55:30
"I'm just glad Nolan listened to criticisms about audio and made the dialogue fully audible for this film. There are some parts at the beginning with a loud score behind them, but aside from that it's crystal clear. 

It was disappointing to see so many reviews of Tenet from viewers who never even gave the film a chance because they couldn't hear what was going on. And in an exposition-heavy plot-driven movie, there's only so much visuals can do at that point. Nolan really shot himself in the foot with that one. I truly believe if Tenet had better audio it wouldn't have been nearly as maligned.",2023-07-27 14:21:47
Why did Oppenheimer and Kitty have a second child if they didn’t like the first one?,2023-07-27 21:48:57

"I loved so much about Oppenheimer, and have been thinking about it non stop since I watched it a week ago, but I’m having trouble with the third act. I was struggling to engage with it watching in real time and even now thinking back, I think it could have been done better. I know the sort of deflating feeling after the massive climax of the second act is intentional, but still.",2023-08-06 15:26:01
"This movie cramped too much story, even it's 3 hour run time is still not enough. It rushed every single scene with dialogues, dialoges, boom, moved on to the next scene, dialogues, next scene, dialogues, boom, next scene... without letting the audience absorb or process the scene.

It's like doing a marathon while holding an explosive diarrhea. This movie can't wait to see the finish line.

Nolan should just focus the story about Oppenheimer and the bomb, leave the story about his communist past, his messy love life, his trial and that strauss rdj story. This is a movie not a documentary. Focus!

Imagine if better filmmaker made this, like Paul Thomas Anderson, Scorsese, Coen bros or Dennis Villeneuve. They would focus the story and let the scenes breathe. Nolan is technically brilliant but he's just an artsy Michael bay.",2023-07-21 11:52:55
"Downvote me all you want, this was a damn snoozefest. It might not be a bad movie objectively; maybe it was made for cinephiles, but I personally thought it was really boring. Never in my life did I want to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie. Maybe I am a bit slow in the head, but I just couldn't keep up with the pace of the movie. The timeline was all over the place and confusing. I couldn't understand quite a huge chunk of dialogues due to poor sound mixing (it doesn't help that I am a non-native English speaker; the British accent is tough to grasp without subtitles). I also found the third half of the movie too stretched out or rather unnecessary. I was simply not interested in the courtroom drama, although I acknowledge that it might be necessary for the story of Oppenheimer. Lastly, the actual explosion was kinda underwhelming. I was expecting more; honestly, the only part I was genuinely hyped about before watching the movie. Also, they didn't show the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing, which I found a bit weird. In the end, I would like to say that this movie was not for me. I had a completely different movie in my mind, but the actual result was the complete opposite of my expectations. I was expecting more action, more focus on the making and working of the bomb, and lastly, a bit more emphasis on the actual bombing and test. What I got in return was a ""The Social Network"" type of drama but with long conversation scenes and characters I couldn't care less about. Again, I am in no way saying that this was a bad movie. The acting was top-notch, the soundtrack was also great, and the filmmaking by Nolan was also absolutely amazing. I just couldn't get into it, and it's totally on me. This was not a movie about WW2 and the atomic bomb; this was a movie about Robert J. Oppenheimer and his life. I just want to give a heads up to the people who are also expecting something more from the movie. It's not an action movie or a WW2 movie; it's a long character study with a lot of dialogue exchange between different characters. I believe many people share my opinion, but at the moment, they are afraid to go against the crowd. You will definitely see conflicting opinions about the movie after its run ends.",2023-07-21 15:52:45
"It’s sad that such a compelling and thought provoking film will be seen as a meme

Couldn’t have asked for anything more from this. The actors across the board all deliver great performances. Murphy and Downey Jr are remarkable, and the directions their characters take are navigated so well that you are constantly wanting more. 

Nolan took a story that the world assumed was known, and took us behind it. Sure the stunning and the deafening parts of the movie looked and felt great. At no point during this movie did I feel slogged or look to a watch. It brings you deep into a story that keeps giving and giving. However the true stunning moment is the emptiness you are felt with in that closing scene, and how that emptiness defined a man’s life, to both himself and his peers.",2023-07-21 03:34:51
3rd best Nolan film for me after TDK and Memento. Cillian proves he can carry a major Hollywood film and Hoyte is as brilliant as ever. His first shot at dominating an awards season is here.,2023-07-21 13:10:42
"This isnt Nolan's best work ever, Im my opinion its Interstellar, but still this movie is sick, the plot was paced well and everything was moving fast and i didnt really feel bored for the entire 3 hours.

My favourite scenes from the entire movie was little frames of Oppenheimer's mind, like little frames of fire, the nuclear reaction, stars and etc. Those sounded amazing and nerve wrecking in the IMAX theatre.

The Trinity test could have been longer and better, Nolan should have also used a bit of CGI to enhance the practical effect done for the test. 

I would rate this an 8/10, its a really amazing movie but it has its flaws.",2023-07-21 22:02:03
"I liked it a lot, it has a lot of what makes Nolan great (Cinematography, sound design (well mixed!), great acting). Cillian Murphy gives an incredibly understated performance where I feel you can see every ounce of pain he feels despite not having a big climactic emotional scene. 

It also has the things I dislike about Nolan, where I don't feel he really leaves any room for subtlety or themes. A bunch of times during the movie I thought ""oh, this is a great nugget to think about"" before a character would just blatantly say what was trying to be shown. 

Also felt it got a little silly with the name dropping, and I almost burst out laughing when Einstein was chilling behind the car towards the end like he was Nick Fury. It was practically Marvel for science nerds with the number of name drops and cameos. When Han Solo said ""...Senator...Kennedy, John F. Kennedy"" I half expected him to look at the camera and wink 

But the 20 minutes or so when they test the bomb, and then the aftermath with him giving the speech was absolutely outstanding. I may not watch the film in cinemas again, but I'll definitely watch this passage of it over and over for years to come. Harrowing and very well done.

8/10 from me",2023-07-22 02:27:01
"Nolan makes very good movies, and this is no exception.

But this is not even his top 5, shows you the levels he’s at.

There’s a lot to like about this movie, cinematography, Cillian, sound are the top three things, but I think he easily could have shed 30-40 mins from it.

Overall for me its a solid 7.5-8/10.",2023-07-22 09:15:20
I guess this is an unpopular opinion but I really hated the scenes with RDJ and Alden Ehrenreich. Just kinda cheesy and you didn’t need Ehrenreich’s weirdly smug character to put together the pieces that the movie laid out already.,2023-07-22 13:02:02
"Just stepped out of the 70mm IMAX showing in Indy. I have no words. This is the best Nolan has ever done. Not sure who finally got him to work on the sound mixing, but he definitely took it to heart. That was a beautiful cinematic experience.",2023-07-22 18:40:51
"I thought the movie was fine but maybe a little mid? I lost the story a few times and it would take me a bit to get it back. And despite Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh giving good performances, I felt like those characters could’ve had a bit more depth to them. 6/10 for me",2023-07-23 03:37:39
"Super fast paced, and sometimes the music would be so loud that I couldn't make out what some of the characters were saying.

Nonetheless, I loved this movie so much. Anything by Christopher Nolan is an instant hit for me, but this one rivals Interstellar on my list of favorite movies. I came out of the movie theater with a lot to think about and a substantial amount of dread about our future lol.",2023-07-24 05:56:48
Really didn’t like Dunkirk (thought it was a good film but not close to the rest of Nolan’s work). Oppenheimer was brilliant - went in blind - there couldn’t be enough hype for this film - it’s brilliant.,2023-07-25 01:27:53
"Was ready to not like this movie but I was so happy with the way it turned out. So glad the climax of the movie wasn’t the trinity test but the moral repercussion of the Japanese bombing. Especially the theme of martyrdom in exchange of accountability. Didn’t think Nolan would think that through, but he took the story where it truely needed to go. 

My biggest gripe is the sound mixing. Please for goodness sake, turn off the music so we can hear what people are saying. It’s my only gripe. 9/10.",2023-07-25 13:20:37

A near perfect film and Nolan’s crowning achievement. A big win for cinema,2023-08-27 16:59:31
"This movie did not go down well with me.
It was not what I expected,
The pace of the movie is set to 110% the entire way
There is so much dialouge it's impossible to keep up
With the pace of the dialouge, conversations do not flow or have any emotion or feeling, also it is hard to follow
It is rooted in politics 90% of the movie, which most people that do not understand complicated politics of the USA in the 40's will struggle with
Time jumping back and forth make it strenuous to follow a story
Other character relations are unclear and unmemorable, it's actually easier to call them by the names of the actor
What I thought would be the climax, the necluear blast, was so underwhelming it's comical, they clearly used gasoline fire to 'simulate' a nuclear blast and it looked nothing like an actual nuclear blast. The shock wave that hits the spectators is hilarious, I thought the producers just used a leaf blower and some dust on set! 

3/10 for me
Could be 8/10 if you already have a firm grasp on the political back story",2023-07-21 11:02:37
"I love Nolan, but across his entire body of work, no matter how ambitious and intelligent the film, I have yet to see him create one truly compelling female character, or at least one who's life doesn't revolve around the male protagonist. 


Tenet was sort of the last straw for me and this film does nothing to alleviate the frustration. Casting two of the finest actors in the industry and and giving them nothing to do but either be naked or drunkenly cry is a real shame.


Especially after seeing it with Barbie I was just hyper aware throughout the film how underused and underwritten the women are. 

Otherwise it is stellar though, 8/10.",2023-07-21 09:47:06

"I saw it today on IMAX. This movie will win all the Oscars; best movie, best direction, leading man, supporting actors, music, sound, editing etc. And deservedly so.

Cinematography, script, editing, sound composition and performances overall are excellent.

But. It’s not 10/10 masterpiece. Even after 3 hours and fantastic performance from Cillian Murphy and the others, I felt empty, like I didn’t care if Oppenheimer loses his security clearance or not. 

And I realized what’s missing from most Nolan’s movies: heart. They are masterful displays of technical excellence and pure cinematic revelations, but sometimes the characters feel somewhat empty and just tools for a puppetmaster to spin his creations around the playground.

In contrast, earlier this week I saw Mission Impossible in IMAX. As a movie, its not at the same level as Oppenheimer, even though its a very good one. But the moment main character Ethan Hunt jumped off the cliff on a motorcycle, I was in tears. Both for the technical excellence of the movie crew and for actually caring about the character.

Really hoping Nolan will next direct something scifi again, so his inability to bring warmth to his characters is not so distracting and he can solely focus on technical excellence and complex plot.",2023-07-21 20:19:25
"That was a return to form for Nolan. Much better than Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet. 

Nolan works best when it’s something more grounded with a twist. While Dunkirk was fine, that movie felt like it was three hours while Oppenheimer felt like two. Tenet and Interstellar run times could also be felt while watching. 

Maybe it’s because I had read “In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer” in high school that it all started connecting as the story went on. I hadn’t read that play in over 15 years so details of who and what was happening were fuzzy, but when they revealed Strauss as the antagonist, I remembered more and more of the context of the play that helped guide the film along. 

Really good work by him and really hoping he stays within reality, either for a biopic like this or something like The Prestige, Memento, or Insomnia for his next.",2023-07-31 23:39:46
Florence Pugh should have been cut out of the movie,2023-08-01 07:19:36
"Saw it last night in Imax. It was ok, it's a solid movie but not meeting the hype. Think the overwhelming sentiment of our group is ""i'm glad I saw it but I'll probably never watch it again"". 

Don't think the storytellling, writing or structure of the film was very good, the first two thirds are messy. Don't think the crescendo of the film lived up to expectations and it lacks the epicness I think I expected and if it was going for a more subtle look at him then it missed the mark widely.",2023-08-06 21:38:13
"Watched it today. It was an okay film in my opinion. Yes, the acting was good, particularly Cillian Murphy. However, it didn't have to be so long. Many scenes, particularly the sex scenes were absolutely unnecessary. I expected some more discussion about the physics and logistics challenges of making the bomb. 3/5",2023-08-28 00:08:39
"Just watched it for the first time. I was immensely disappointed. I would have given it a C or C- if it was a normal length movie. But I have to drop my grade down to a D- since it there was no reason for it to be 3 hours long. I'm sick of all these directors putting out mediocre films over 2.5 hours. If your film is not a masterpiece, keep it at a reasonable 2 hours",2023-12-09 18:13:37
"I thought the movie was trash. Sorry.

Matt Parker and Trey Stone (South Park) once gave [a lecture on story structure.](https://youtu.be/vGUNqq3jVLg?t=47) ""If your story beats are connected by 'and then,' you're f***ed. What should happen between those beats are the words 'therefore' or 'but'.""

Oppenheimer was nearly all ""and then."" It was a bad story for the first 2 hours. How were his student days in Europe relevant to the story? The plot and villain only kicked off after the explosion.

Until then, every scene was something along the lines of: ""Dr. Oppenheimer, you aren't allowed to do this."" ""Well what if I do it anyway."" ""I see your point, lets do it."" There was no time for conflicts to establish before they were solved. *And then* the next scene happens. Tell me the point of showing us Oppenheimer and Colonel Groves selecting the location by drawing a map with an X, Oppenheimer saying ""we're going..."" on the train, and finishing the sentence with ""to Los Alamos"" when they arrive as if they stopped talking the rest of the train ride. Another problem solved before it was a problem. *And then...*

Nolan has always had trouble writing relatable human drama. That's okay, he made up for it in spectacle and blowing my goddamn mind. But without those to fall back on, Oppenheimer fell on its butt IMHO.",2023-07-28 15:34:01
"I'm sorry to say I didn't have a wonderful time watching Oppenheimer. I thought it was good, not great. I had trouble following everything especially regarding the back and forth jumps in time. I also got confused about all the different people and their relationships and spent far too much in my own head trying to figure certain things out that I couldn't immerse myself fully in the experience. I also felt that everything moved a little too quickly at times. 

In all likelihood, a couple to few more viewings and I might get all the way there but I don't think I enjoyed it enough to go through the effort.",2023-07-21 09:46:35
I'm surprised how many people are saying they liked the bomb scene. Like yeah the direction and the audio and all that was great but the explosion itself looked like someone took one of those cheap special effects explosion packs and pasted it onto the black background and called it a day. It looked really awkward like a car sized explosion going off a few feet away from them and not at all like a nuclear explosion in the distance.,2023-07-21 03:20:39
"I’m in the minority here but I definitely felt the 3 hour runtime. Well-made movie with a lot of greatness, but it also felt like Nolan at his most indulgent. Can’t help but feel this probably could’ve been like… 2 hours?

I think having an hour of fallout focused on a fairly dry subject post-climax kinda soured my mood by the time I walked out of the theater.",2023-07-21 04:12:57
"People are complaining about the last one hour but my issue is with the first one hour, i felt like those scenes werent that interesting with nothing much happening other than establishing that Oppenheimer is leaning towards left-wing. Also the love story part didn't serve any purpose 

The part from the los almos to meeting with the president after Hiroshima and Nagasaki is good.

The part after this felt like a complete genre shift after what we have witnessed until that point but I found this part profound and moving

Since all these three parts are intercut in the movie, the movie is boring and engaging depending on the timeline.

Over all the entire movie felt it had too many characters, too much interrogation-room drama, too much of a non-linear narrative. Also the conflict with Downey's character didn't feel like it is well established",2023-07-21 13:53:53
"It could have been 10/10 for me if:

- cut some scenes and focus on certain important scenes longer, all the scenes felt short but there were a lot of scenes

- the trinity explosion should have been bigger and more scary and longer duration (lynch gave a great example in twin peaks the return episode 8, it gave me a visceral feeling, dreamlike but terror and fear)

- pugh was miscast

- a lot of famous actors playing characters that were never properly introduced so it just felt like rami malek is here and playing somebody and so on

- wish it was more on how they worked to create the bomb and how the aftermath affected his public image

What I appreciated:

- cillian is amazing, his performance  is brilliant,  not for a second i thought he is thomas shelby except maybe when he did that walk with the hat and pipe on. But he carried the whole movie perfectly. 

- rdj finally back to acting and showing how good he is

- garry was there for like 5mins and he made me despise truman

- the underlying dread, anxiety and melancholy (we are living in a world that can end anytime due to nuclear bombs)",2023-07-21 15:22:35
"As someone who has trouble with dialogue heavy movies, this was tough to get through. I was kinda expecting it though after reading a few reviews. I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it in one go if I was sitting at home. It's a bit easier in the cinema.

What I was expecting to be the highlight of the movie for me, the Trinity Test itself, was sadly kind of a let down. It was build up amazingly well, only for the actual explosion to be kind of underwhelming, where I didn't really get a sense of scale, maybe because of the editing. I liked the silence and the delay of the shockwave alot though.

Through out the movie I was also thinking, what is the point of filming it in IMAX when most of the scenes are indoor in small rooms. As for the cinematography, it didn't really stand out to me, can't think of any memorable shots. Unlike fx Dunkirk and Interstellar that has many amazing shots that made my jaw drop.

The performances were all excellent, and I can definitely see an Oscar nomination for Cillian Murphy and RDJ.

The score was also amazing, just wish it was used more.

Overall it was a very well crafted movie, with the performances and score as the highlights for me. The dialogue was great even if there was a bit too much of it for my taste. The pacing also felt like typical Nolan, very fast paced, almost no downtime, which I like.",2023-07-21 18:18:24
"I can't heap enough praise onto Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt for their dialogue. Not just the flawless accents, but the unique cadence and delivery of people of that time period that's essentially disappeared from the current era. It just isn't something people think about when they're acting, nor would I expect them to, but god it was incredible to hear. 
Not just the thought given to it, but the perfectly casual execution. At no point did I feel like I was watching an actor act, and that's the best indicator of a performance, for me. 

This was a tense and heartrending movie. An excellent emotional journey I'll probably never willingly experience again because I like to be happy LOL

I knew I would enjoy the movie, but I'm surprised how obsessed I am the morning after. It always had several things going for it that appealed to me (big Murphy fan, a historical event and figure I'm interested in) but the way it sank its claws in-- I can't believe it. That, uh.... that ending sure leaves you spiraling.",2023-07-21 18:25:05
Weird that Nolan decided to include Heisenberg in the movie. Walter White wasn't even alive during WWII,2023-07-21 18:46:55
"I really liked the gym room scene and how Nolan captured anxiety, it was amazing.

But I am gonna be honest, I was really bored for most of the movie, it’s a very dialogue heavy movie and personally I don’t know much about the history behind Oppenheimer, so for me it was not as enjoyable.  But still there are some great individual scenes",2023-07-21 20:54:29
"Good if you like history and the acting was amazing, the script wasn’t as great and it jumped around a lot while also dragging. This meant you didn’t really get much depth from the characters even with the long run time. I also felt there was a lack of historical context setting beyond it being WWII and ‘communism bad’. The second half was superior to the first and his speech after the US bombed Japan was my favourite scene.

Not surprising, but Nolan really needs to improve his female characters. Pugh felt wasted considering Jean was pretty interesting in real life and that sex scene with that line was laughable.

6.5-7/10.",2023-07-21 22:25:20
"Going against the grain here, but I should have known as most Nolan's movie leave me emotionally cold because he seems more interested in the steps of his ideas than the emotional core of his characters.

Technically, it's a gorgeous film, some of the better cinematography of Nolan's oeuvre with solid performances from most of the cast.

But the non-linear narrative is needlessly complicated (three timelines fighting is each other with distinc flair but not much new substance to some of them, mostly the Strauss committee where an action taken prior to it is treated as a twist).

The score is overbearing at times. Some great sound design choices convey great emotions while others only muddy the dialogue. 

It's runtime is really felt. The most interesting parts for me were before the trinity test with a clear real time crunch (the postdam conference and the subsequent bombings) and important discussions of what to do with the bombs and the diverging opinions of the scientist.

And the nudity felt aukward and superfluous.",2023-07-21 23:09:33
"It's so wild that Nolan cast his own daughter as the girl with her face peeling off. 

Like he had to make it personal and disturbing to himself in order to psychologically feel the weight of the torment and recreate it.",2023-07-22 03:18:05
"I think the hype killed this one for me. It’s a good movie, but not in his top 3 imo.",2023-07-22 03:43:20
"* If you guys go into this movie expecting a fantastical Nolan movie like Tenet, Inception or Interstellar, you will definitely leave the theater dissatisfied. 

* The non linear storytelling helps in looping back story in a beautiful way but it is also it's achilles heels. It made some part feels out place and rushed.

* This movie doesn't need to be watch on 75mm bar one scene. The black and white part serve as a narrative purpose but imo it doesn't have the awe where you would say, yes it better enjoyed as a black and white film.

* don't go into this movie with hype, but goes into it with an open mind and a room to ponder. As someone who is a novice in Science and American politics, I did get lost in who's who of it all.

* the trinity test was beautifully presented but Nolan absolutely fails to scale to the audience how big the explosion was. You know its far from how it was presented but you don't feel it was far. Like seeing on a map how far 3 hour drive is vs actually driving for 3 hours.

* despite my gripes with the movie, it have the mark of an Oscar for me. From the acting, the score, the editing. It is a peak for Nolan movie.",2023-07-22 03:43:48
"This is one of thoes movies that I can acknowledge That it’s very well made and can understand why people love it but it’s just not for me. 

The direction and acting was top notch in this movie, seriously incredible. But three hours of People in boardrooms talking about Science, math, and WW2 era politics just doesn’t interest me very much. The Non linear Storytelling works great when you are doing a high concept Sci-fi action thriller, but when you’re doing a biopic where the characters, their relationships 
and motivations are the most important thing and you can’t understand what’s going on half the time is a Huge problem. Overall this felt like a very Exposition heavy Wikipedia article that is one of thoes movies that the teacher would put on a Friday afternoon and I would sleep through. I don’t really know who I would recommend this movie To other than history nerds. 

6/10",2023-07-22 05:49:55
"In the least derogatory way possible, this is the wokest movie I seen in recent memory.

It dissects the American myth of requiring nukes to force Japan into a surrender, our role in the global proliferation of nuclear arms, and just overall the bullish and short sighted nature of American foreign policy. 

Then there was the moment that separated communism as a shorthand for soviet influence with communism as a proworker prohuman organization. 

I'm just surprised that a mainstream American film actually examined and criticized those pillars that held up 20th century US.

Like the movie could have focused on the triumph of the Manhattan Project but focused on the horror of an upcoming atomic age.",2023-07-22 05:54:54
The way Oppenheimer’s love for quantum mechanics portrayed by the infinite expanse of the universe in the beginning of the film versus the end where he’s encased by a B-52 unable to see beyond the warheads shooting up into the clouds was masterfully done,2023-07-22 15:15:16
"The movie isn't about the Manhattan Project and isn't an Oppenheimer bio, either of which would've been more accessible/audience-pleasing but I don't think those topics interest Nolan.  He wanted to emphasize the divergent motivations and attributes of those who produce scientific wonders vs those who consume/use/sponsor them and how the former cannot control the latter.

The genesis of the film was the fact that the Manhattan Project folks knew there was a nonzero chance to destroy the world but pushed the button anyway.   That's why Trinity is highlighted and Hiroshima/Nagasaki not shown.   Nolan  seems to feel we're doing the same thing with AI.  It's a cautionary tale.",2023-07-22 19:54:49
"Actually didn’t like it as much as I thought I would. Might try and go see it again but to me the pace was suffocatingly fast, felt overly explained, and Oppy felt white washed when his character displayed traits almost as destructive as the weapon he created.

I loved the IMAX features and cinematography. Overarching themes were very interesting but nothing interesting seemed to happen until the bomb dropped. Just much more biopic than expected. Not my favorite Nolan movie but still decent. 
6.5/10",2023-07-23 00:00:24
"The movie was fine. A few steps above a Lifetime biopic. 

I remember The Dark Knight was my favorite movie for years starting when I was 12 at release. Then I rewatched it recently and found some of the dialogue to be a bit lacking, but nothing too crazy, maybe just age. 

Then comes Dunkirk, Tenet, and now Oppenheimer. All I've found guilty to varying degrees of horribly conveying the dialogue, with Tenet being completely unwatchable for me. They're either poorly mixed or the conversations are just so rapid, unnatural, and full of information.

Subtitles would improve my experience for sure, but overall for a 3 hour movie to feel so rapid-fire with fast paced dialogue and switching between timelines is not a great experience. And I'm sure people will say ""it's supposed to induce anxiety etc. etc."" but that's such a cop out. I feel tje same way with ""The Bear"" if anyone can sympathize with that...

This had no need to be 3 hours long and with more selectivity of its scenes and dialogue, would have personally taken this from a 6.5/10 to at least an ~8/10. Nolan's a great director, but his insistance on writing as well keeps some of his films from being my favorites now that I'm an adult.",2023-07-23 08:38:37
Fun Fact: In the post credit scene where RDJ starts the Oppengers Initiative is call back to a previous film he was in.,2023-07-23 16:34:00
"The only part of the movie that left a sour taste in my mouth is the depiction of Strauss. In a film that's trying hard to be very nuanced and showcase all angles of motivations, considerations, etc it seemed absurd to turn Strauss into a one-dimensional comic book villain who wanted to destroy Oppenheimer because he made him look bad once and have that be the driving force of the character. I thought that was probably the worst possible motivation to give him.

Awesome movie though, thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it. The speech scene after the bombs went off and seeing people throw up outside and picturing the flesh being burnt off of beautiful women was all very haunting and interesting. Kind of baffles my mind that anyone can cheer after dropping a nuke.

Most powerful and chilling line of the movie had to have been when he talked about how he changed his mind about the nuclear program once he realized that any weapon we created we would use.",2023-07-23 17:38:11

"Only thing holding this movie back is a lack of scenes dealing with the scale of the atrocities we committed. There are a couple good scenes like the scene at the gymnasium highlighting the human cost of the bombs, but the movie could've used more of that to drive home the horror of what Oppenheimer had created.",2023-07-25 04:04:14
"I feel like the explosion just didn't work for me. The sound wave hitting was good (dont know if we needed the big clap twice). But it kinda jus looked like a big petrol explosion past the initial blinding light (in b4 downvotes and ""well thats what a real a-bomb explosions looks like"" I don't care, it was lackluster for me). I know thats what an atom bomb looks like but I feel it would've hit better to keep the slowmo close up fireball that was shown at the beginning for this. Clock hits zero, slow mo explosion moving out, blinding light, fireball, thunder clap. I know what a really big explosion looks like, but this was supposed to show them heralding us into the next age of humanity. Just didn't hit home. But it was still interesting past that with all the aftermath and political skulduggery which I didnt really know going into the film. I knew he was against the nuclear arms race but didnt know about the RDJr guys attempts to silence him. Overall it was alright. Its not going on the 'rainy day' films list with other great biopics though",2023-07-25 19:33:30

"This is going to sound overwhelmingly snobbish, my apologies.  
Prior to watching Oppenheimer, I read the book American Prometheus upon which the movie is based. I rewatched most of Nolan's films and spent time watching the best interviews I could find with the cast. This is definitely Nolan-fanboy behavior, but I do this as much as I can for different media.  
I watched the movie and enjoyed it immensely, but more than anything felt it was an important piece of art that merited discussion at an intellectual level that matched its subject matter. Yet every review seems to be drowning in its author's own moralistic or political agenda, or perhaps is a smothering evaluation of Nolan's entire output, or maybe is but a suffocating recitation of who plays what and if they did an okay job.  
Not that redditors need any reason to feel superior, but commenter's honest reactions to moments in the movie as stated in review threads are often the most illuminating discourse on a movie, despite frequently being drowned in a sea of perennially upvoted funny quotes.  
We are lucky to have a film that is a real artwork on our hands here, and it deserves real critique. It deserves learned critique, i.e. professional reviewers need to have read the book. It deserves humble critique that does not have an agenda of its own. And it deserves empathetic critique, seeking to understand the movie's goals rather than espouse your own understanding of issues.  
If anyone has favorite reviewers or other resources that this insufferable snob might approve of, I appreciate your recommendation.",2023-07-27 05:15:03
"This film was incredible. I’m actually left feeling really impacted after this film and only the real good films do that. 

I think Nolan is just a genius at what he does. I know a lot of people say that but it can’t go understated. I’m trying to get my head around how someone can structure and write a film like that with a budget and create something so complex that tells such a profound story and deals with everything in such a gripping way, it’s amazing. 

The score was absolutely phenomenal and I really hope Cillian Murphy gets an Oscar for this because he’s such a fantastic actor and he deserves the recognition. I also think Emily blunt was fantastic. 

I latched onto the sense that the film would end where we finally see Oppenheimer’s perspective in the Einstein conversation when Strauss mentioned how he wondered what they had said. I assume this was what Nolan wanted the audience to think, it urges you to wonder what they spoke about that left Einstein looking so shaken and it really pays off. 

I’m going to have to watch this again in the cinema while it’s out because it’s a film that absolutely needs to be seen in a cinema for the full experience.",2023-07-28 04:09:40

"Went to a IMAX showing at Regal Westbury for 10:30 PM last night and once the movie ended the majority of all you heard from everyone leaving was how that was the most boring film they have ever seen. I on the other hand loved it. I did however find the first 20 mins very confusing but it just got better and better by the minute.  


It truly made me sad hearing constantly from 80% of everyone leaving the packed theatre how bad the movie was. As the movie was ending some guys in their early 20s just shouted BORING at the top of their lungs and everyone laughed. I even heard several people say they expected many nuke scenes/showing of japanese bombs.  


I bet the people who watched it opening weekend felt otherwise.",2023-07-30 18:19:08
"I enjoyed it overall, but I think it was a half-hour too long. I found myself getting bored waiting for the Manhattan Project to start up. I think Robert Downey Jr. had the best performance in the movie, and I really hope he gets Best supporting Actor at the Oscars for it.

edit: There were also a few scenes that were a bit too loud for me, like the shockwave from the Trinity test. Even though I knew it was coming, it still jumpscared me.",2023-07-31 04:31:24
"The ENTIRE movie is exposition. I couldn't get past it. Every single scene is an uninterrupted spew of expository factoids. It's like a wikipedia audiobook.

I really wanted to like this one but I just couldn't shake the feeling I was watching a bunch of robots reciting very fast cue cards at me. Like, no one even TALKS different. They all have the same cadence, voice, vocabulary, witticisms.

I have to admit I actually laughed when RDJ said ""So you're saying the greatest accomplishment of my career is about to become the greatest humiliation in history"" or something like that. That's some George Lucas-level writing.

Reluctantly, 6 out of 10. My ears hurt.",2023-07-22 05:14:15

"Masking the sounds of the applause in the audience with the screams of terror from Hiroshima, cascading with the never-ending pounding of the stomping was straight-up panic-inducing.

I was honestly surprised at just how subdued the visuals actually were for this movie. A lot less than what you would get in most Nolan films... There is a part of me that admittedly was first disappointed watching the A-bomb explosion since I hyped myself up SO much to see it...

The shots and sounds he DID use however... Wow. Some of the most absolutely mesmerizing and haunting images that I have witnessed. Particularly the shots showing Oppie's anxiety after he gave his victorious speech, and especially the last scene with Einstein before the credits. That image of the warheads and our world will forever haunt me seeing it on that 70MM IMAX screen.

It is terrifying to see what has been unleashed, but so god damn necessary. This was everything I pretty much could've hoped for when I first heard about this film... All I hope now is that the day never comes where we see Nolan's ""vision"" ever play out.",2023-07-21 15:45:44

Trinity test was unreal. The silence was palpable",2023-07-22 06:19:52

Maybe it didn't go over the top for a movie about a bomb, but it built up so steadily and consistently for such a long movie, then the payoff, then the implications/repercussions about what happens after we get the bomb was well played. I felt the gravity of the situation multiple times. They dropped a lot of names and it just felt like so many important people were there and being moved around and coordinated by oppenheimer made him seem even more divine. Lots of nuances, subtleties, callbacks. Solid movie.",2023-07-22 14:52:21

"I can't remember the last time I've seen a film in theaters that truly moved me. It didn't feel like I was watching a film in 2023.

Oppenheimer is excellently crafted and Nolan's use of nonlinear storytelling lends itself perfectly to the plot.

My *only* criticism is that Nolan seems really committed to how he approaches the volume of dialogue. And in a dialogue-driven film, it was fairly aggravating to frequently miss important things that characters said to one another.

Other than that, bravo.",2023-07-23 14:32:19
"A question to non-Nolanites;

Is this film actually good?",2023-07-26 17:44:57
"I think this movie is probably great for people who are really into history and politics. I definitely admire the movie for how thorough and in-depth it is in that aspect. And there's something about Christopher Nolan's storytelling style that really forces you to focus and pay close attention to the story, and I thought that was effective here and kept the movie from being boring for the most part. But I thought there wasn't really enough payoff to justify how dense the story is. The scenes that took the time to slow down and focus on a particular event or mood were fantastic, but they were too few and far between.",2023-07-27 16:30:52
Very good.  Half hour to an hour too long.  But this is becoming typical.  Score was too constant and too loud in most scenes.    But thats a Nolan thing.  Did he pick up a coke or adderall habit in the last few years?,2023-12-24 02:30:55
"I love Nolan, but am I the only one that thinks he missed showing the magnitude of the explosion? Was it cause the self limitation to not use CGI? Everyone is talking about the sound… do you see why everyone is talking about the sound? Because visually we didn’t get the explosion. Love Nolan anyway, this movie is awesome anyway.",2023-07-21 07:31:07

"This is embarrassing, but I caught the 70mm screening and wasn't a fan of the film. Not the movie, but the film.

For me at least, I was expecting a much bigger screen and the flickering during bright scenes was a little distracting.",2023-07-21 23:03:35
"The explosion was an amazing theatre experience. The moment the bomb detonated, there was just silence in the whole cinema. It felt so intense waiting for the shockwave and the sound blasting out of the speakers. But overall it was an ok movie. For my taste way too political, especially the communism shit before the Detonation. I actually drifted away there and didn't really know what was going on. It was just too boring. I really hoped it wouldn't get that much politics...and it was way too long. But nonetheless a good movie",2023-07-21 23:11:18
"I loved that one part of the score that included Geiger-Mueller detector in it. Typical Nolan being a genius with sound design.
This was the first time I have been to one of his movies and I understood every word. It was refreshing.",2023-07-22 00:20:34
"I liked it, and I don't usually like this type of movie. I guess I had the right expectations. If you went to see the movie just for ""big bada booms"" your going to be disappointed, but the acting was fantastic as was Oppenheimer visualizing things. The third act was definitely the best part of the movie and had me on the edge of the seat how things were going to work out even though I had a general idea of how it did in real life. Rami Malek's character came in clutch and I was so relieved when he spoke up",2023-07-22 01:04:49
Saw it in 70mm imax absolutely phenomenal. The silence during the trinity test felt absolutely suffocating,2023-07-22 01:13:54
"**PLOT QUESTION**: One scene early in the film when Oppenheimer is a professor, the other scientist (Ernest Lawrence) says he has a lecture and Oppenheimer needs to leave. Oppenheimer says he'll sit in, but Lawrence says no. Then, two military guys walk in and Oppenheimer leaves. What was that about?",2023-07-22 02:03:10
"Loved it.  Having been interested in the atomic program since elementary school I was particularly interested in this film.  I'm not a scholar or mega fan of Chris Nolan either, but the actors in this movie are all actors I really enoy.   

Ultimately I, too, was maybe expecting more of an action movie than it really was. Because I knew/remembered that this was largely based on a novel I was able to pivot my expectations rather quickly.  I also don't mind a dialogue heavy movie.  But it certainly took a conscious second to tell myself ""Oh ok, this isn't going to just be a bunch of exploisions"" and get into the movie for what it was.  

Tons of memorable lines.  Tons of great acting.  The score was incredible.  Being reminded of the weird communist timeline was fascinating.  I really enjoyed the haphazard smattering of historical events and historical scientists sprinkled throughout the film, even if I only kind of recognize their names rather than knowing how important they actually were.  

I often find myself bored in movies, and this was 3 hours long and I never felt that way.  That alone puts it in a rare category for me.  

The explosion itself wasn't as spectacular as I would have expected, but I also didn't really care ultimately.  It did its job in the film, and I respect that they didn't cave and throw in a huge CGI element.  Also the suspense leading up to it was palpable.  

The speech scene was intense and visceral.  

Really great movie, but one that I feel will be hard to recommend to certain people in my life.  If history, or this particular time in history, isn't that interesting to you, then I'm not sure they're gonna be able to sit through this.  And/or if they don't enjoy a dialogue-driven movie this isn't gonna sit well.  Also having SOME knowledge of the players and events here goes a pretty long way, even if it really isn't that important to the story portrayed, people might get tripped up thinking they need to know more about these folks than they really do.",2023-07-22 05:05:05

"Just want to temper everyone’s expectations around Oscars for this film. We have another film by a legendary director that’s guaranteed to be great coming out this year - Killers of the Flower Moon. Where that film might hold an advantage at the Oscars is its representation of minority groups, while Oppie is a 100% white mostly male centred film. Representation is something the Academy has stated is a big focus for them, and I won’t be surprised if it works in Killers… favour.",2023-07-22 13:26:03
Loved the movie. As a reader of *American Prometheus* I wanted more scenes from before the Manhattan project showing more why Oppenheimer was considered as the man to manage the project. With no prior knowledge I could see everything as rushed and confusing though. It’s a lot to try to cover even in 3 hours. I really wanna see what had to be cut and wouldn’t be opposed to a Nolan cut (or Oppenheimer begins). Ludwig’s score really sold the movie though especially in the moments of silence. Overall as an already invested party I enjoyed what got covered and the scale Nolan reached. Is it for everyone? Nope. Good Nolan movie? Yup it’s up there,2023-07-22 20:52:01
"Honestly it reminded me a lot of Lincoln. A general slow burn with really poignant moments and extremely well acted all around. 

The storytelling isn't anything ground breaking but I really enjoyed the non-linear format going back and forth between the past and present to add motivation and context to the characters. 

Also, I'm a sucker for Einstein so I was grinning ear to ear in the scenes he was in.",2023-07-23 01:22:34

"Just got home from it. Being a fan of Nolan, Murphy, & biopics, I REALLY wanted to love this movie and I ended up just…liking it. 7.5/10?

SO much of the cast feels overqualified for the actual screentime and depth (or lack thereof) their characters end up having. Pugh and Blunt in particular (and for very different reasons) are criminally underused (Pugh’s role really seems to come down to “this was a famous actress willing to do nude scenes”). I’m left asking myself why they bothered casting Rami Malek, Kenneth Branaugh, or Gary Oldman given their roles are essentially cameos (but not necessarily scene-stealing ones you’ll remember years later, like Channing Tatum in Hateful 8 or Bullet Train) and minor parts that went to actors like Jack Quaid or Olivia Thirlby feel beneath an established actor and better suited to unknowns for whom simply being present in a Nolan movie would serve as a resume highlight and become recognizable years from now in retrospect. 

Murphy is of course phenomenal and will deserve the Best Actor awards he collects next year. The cinematography and sound design are fantastic, and no one gives a subpar performance (my criticism is purely in the amount of material they’re given to work with, not their actual work itself). 

Now, I’m the last person to complain that a movie is “too long”, and I’m not sure I’d say this one IS…but it really didn’t need to be 3 hours and I could feel my theater’s collective vibe growing restless when it was clear that there was another hour to go after the Trinity test. 

And the clearest thing to cut (this’ll be a controversial take), is almost everything to do with RDJ’s character. That subplot, particularly in the last hour, seems to exist primarily to give RDJ screentime to build a Best Supporting Actor campaign and ultimately kinda throws off the momentum of the film, which is at its best when it’s either following the story of building the bomb (with the interview frame narrative) or grappling with the moral & philosophical questions the bomb has introduced (such as scenes with Krumholtz’ character or Einstein). Ultimately, I just didn’t care about RDJ’s character and wasn’t surprised/effected by the “twist” because I never felt he & Oppenheimer were particularly close. Jason Clarke was a far more useful “antagonist” (such as he is) by being the anti-communist attack dog interrogating Oppenheimer in the frame narrative than RDJ became in the last hour and I think the film is just a lot leaner if the framing interview itself serves as the source of tension in the plot. 

Anyway, I know that take might catch me some grief (to be clear RDJ is good in the role, I’m just not convinced the character actually adds to the movie apart from padding an extra 45 or so minutes of runtime), so I’ll reiterate that the film is objectively good and I recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible…it’s far from Nolan’s best and it has, in my opinion, been overhyped.",2023-07-23 04:50:23

Btw people here have valid complaints about the movie being boring and a snooze fest for those who expected more explosions rather than courtroom drama. I can definitely understand it. It’s one of those of movies, you’ll either love it or hate it.",2023-07-23 07:34:44

"My favorite Nolan movie so far outside of the Dark Knight trilogy (it is the only Nolan film i have seen in a theater so that might be part of it). 

What I really liked about this film is the feeling of dread  that comes with the whole life of the atomic bomb.

"Can someone explain roughly the chronology of the movie ? I got almost everything but the ending left me so confused. The ending is going back to the very beggining, when Oppenheimer talk with Einstein. It explain the scene where Strauss think Oppenheimer set Einstein against him. The truth about what happened is revealed and we see what the conversation was about, except that it end with Oppenheimer reminding Einstein about how he came to him because of the almost non-existant probability of an explosion that wouldn't stop and would destroy the atmosphere, and how he was afraid that it actually happened right ? So this conversation happened AFTER the bomb was created and used, but before the whole Strauss revenge attempt. I'm confused about where to place this moment because I really thought that Oppenheimer met the whole crew of physicians AFTER meeting with Strauss in the very beggining. Their meeting is also very ""first time meeting you"" the way they talk to each others/introduce themselves is also as if they were complete strangers then, but if the chronology is as it should be, they should have met already a few times (that one time Strauss was ridiculized, that one meeting where they got different opinions as well). And then again, if the chronology is as I understand it, it should logically be that Oppenheimer is a teacher, then is chosen to lead the secret project, then the whole project happening (also including asking Einstein for his opinion about the risk of damaging/potentially destroying the atmosphere and the whole world, and that one interview where Oppenheimer ridicule Strauss), then project is a success and Oppenheimer become like the most known man in the world) then Strauss offering the post as the beggining of his revenge and then that's when the discussion with Einstein happen ? Is that right ? Or do they meet before the project ? But then how come Oppenheimer was talking about the probability of having affected the atmosphere with Einstein, if it was before the bombing ? And if it was after, then how much time pass between Strauss's offer to Oppenheimer and the whole interrogatory thing ? 😵",2023-08-19 04:23:43
"Do I *need* to see Oppenheimer in the theater?

I have tickets for a 70mm IMAX coming up this Tuesday.

The argument for the experience would be that Nolan movies are some of my best theatrical memories (Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception). I saw all of them two or three times in the theater, and still continue to watch them annually.

Arguments against
* “It’s loud, and the sound mixing is terrible. It’ll be even worse in IMAX.” Said some industry sound expert friends. Matches with Nolan’s reputation.
* I watched Tenet once at home, and haven’t watched it since. Didn’t love it or hate it, just, meh.
* I have two young kids, so seeing a long movie in a theater is taking time off work and my partner watching kids for the evening. Doable, but some _cost_ there.
* I watch everything with subtitles on, because my hearing sucks, and Nolan definitely doesn’t help. I feel like I’m going to miss a good chunk of dialog given his reputation.

Leaning towards not going and just watching at home 3 months from now. Thoughts?

Edit: Saw it! Good!",2023-08-28 05:28:52
"This was my worst cinema experience so far. It felt like a business meeting. Boring, useless, overly long, full of talk without pause, you can’t leave for courtesy reasons, and you don’t know when it will end. If I had watched it on Netflix i would have stopped after trinity. I did not care at all about his stupid security clearance, why does he even need it anymore after the project had been finished? I considered leaving the cinema after 2:30 hours, but didn’t because I thought I might be the only person in the room too dumb to get the movie, but it turned out my partner felt the same. 

I realize after reading the ratings that she and I are probably the only people in the world that didn’t get the movie, so this will probably also become my most downvoted comment ever. That’s ok, I‘m more sad about having wasted three hours of my life and I won’t get them back ever. 

I do not understand the appeal of the movie whatsoever. Maybe it was the german dub that killed it for me, but I really don’t want to waste another three hours to check if the original makes the worst movie I have ever endured a decent one.",2023-07-28 08:24:01
"Yeah now that i've slept on it this was a bad film, I think that a 6/10 may be generous. Plot is not compelling whatsoever, so sterile in general from the character's interactions to the overall vibe of the movie. Oppenheimer himself has no consistency as a character, Cillian Murphy did a good job acting but the script and dialogue was just so lame and lacking anything that resembles an interesting story.

&#x200B;

The skipping between time periods thing works sometimes but it did not for this movie, it's jarring to skip forward and backward so much especially when the only interesting plot/conflict comes at the end of the film. Nolan has never been a particularly great writer of dialogue and without an interesting setting or characters the entire film just feels so flat. How you get a cast this good to give some of their most forgettable performances is crazy.

For me, Nolan's worst film and quite disappointing",2023-07-21 12:51:52
"Just watched the movie last night. 

I can not understate how phenomenal the soundtrack compliments the movie. It constantly creates this feeling of uneasiness and wonder. I love the fact that it plays for the majority of the movie, making a dialogue intensive movie feel like a thriller, while also making the moments without music special and hit harder. 

The use of imagery throughout the film was fantastic. The cast, as expected, was amazing. 

As someone that did just visit the Peace Memorial at Hiroshima, I do think a little more could’ve been said about Japan & the controversies around the bombing, but to be fair, this was a movie from Oppenheimer’s POV.",2023-07-21 17:49:44

People who don’t like the communist plot line are missing the point and are taking for granted the fear America had.  When Russia liberated Berlin a lot of scientists went to Russia like they came to America via operation paperclip. The fear Nazis made us start the bomb. The fear of the Communists made us finish and use the bomb.  The McCarthy era is and will be a dark stain on America. One stain of many. Thematically it was a good mirror of Einstein’s experience before fleeing. I might be missing other things but the communist plot line is vital to this story.,2023-07-22 14:26:03
"One really poignant moment which stood out for me was when the bomb departed on the trailer and you could hear the metal chains moving against it as Oppenheimer watched, evoking that he’ll be forever shackled to it.

"As someone who grew up in Los Alamos (in the late nineties and early 2000's), this movie was strangely personal to me, and I want to share a few things.  
  
1. A few of the scenes in the movie (such as the Christmas party) took place in a building called ""Fuller Lodge"" that was there since before the manhattan project (when the place was essentially a camp for boy scouts). Growing up, I've had middle school dances, boy scout ceremonies and other town events take place there.

2. In the ninties, my dad briefly met Edward Teller the hydrogen bomb guy. Essentially, Teller used a restroom my dad used at the same time. They didn't talk or anything, but my dad and the father of the hydrogen bomb peed next to each other, which i think is neat.

3. Los Alamos is a lot more of a pine forest (that occasionally bursts into [flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Grande_Fire)) than it appeared in the film. A lot of the area surrounding Los Alamos resembled what it looked like on screen though. But it was mostly like the pine forest from the one scene where Oppenheimer is in the snow crying about his former lover's suicide",2023-07-22 23:00:21

"Ignorantly, I didn’t know really anything about Oppenheimer before going into this movie. So, in the third half I kept wondering why Oppie was getting tried so intensely and accusatory - especially considering he was being celebrated not long prior.  I thought surely this cant just be because he embarrassed Strauss. I thought I’d missed something. Well turns out, no it was exactly that and Strauss was just a massive narcissist with the most fragile ego 😅 true example of being petty as fuuuuck",2023-07-24 07:03:39
"Generally don't like biopics but this film is incredible and I really cannot stop thinking about it.

I think people who see Nolan's name come into this film expecting some big extravaganza action flick but this is a character story about obsession, guilt and ambition. The film makes us feel what Oppenheimer felt went through, from his spectacular achievements to the despairing depths in his life.",2023-07-24 14:36:28
"Am I the only one who had a hard time understanding bits and pieces of the dialogue (especially from characters/actors with heavier accents)?

The pacing was all over the place. The score was demanding and insistent and never gave scenes/character interactions room to breathe. The movie being edited in a nonlinear fashion didn't help, either.

The Trinity Test explosion was underwhelming when you compare it to footage (which you can find on YouTube) of the real thing.

Good performances all around. RDJ is in pretty much a shoo-in for Best Supporting.

Tom Conti was one of the highlights of the film for me. His portrayal of Einstein was fantastic.

Oppenheimer showed more remorse and regret for Jean Tatlock than he did for helping create the most devastating weapon in the history of mankind.",2023-07-25 13:03:31

"What an exhausting movie, my goodness. I don't get why the movie needed to be shot in IMAX. The IMAX screen showing constant extreme closeups was plain uncomfortable. I genuinely think I would've enjoyed the film more on a laptop with subtitles.

#What I liked:

### Visions and Imaginings
The cutaway shots of particles swirling, atoms splitting, wave functions mingling and collapsing, V2's flying overhead, the atmosphere burning, and others were beautiful and exciting.

### The Cast
The cast was excellent. All around. Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy are standouts to me.

### Photographic Accuracy
Some details were recreated with astounding accuracy, the gadget itself looks exactly like the photographs of it.

#What I disliked:

###Explosition
Oh my god, holy shit, every other line in this movie is a character explaining either a technical or plot detail. Matt Damon says ""I've heard a lot about you, you are a womanizer, a dilettante, etc."" It's such weak dialogue. This is the Oppenheimer movie, he's the main character, but it sounds like Damon's introducing him as a member of the Suicide Squad.

### Scene Length
I'd be shocked if any scene in this movie was longer than a minute. The movie has a relentless pace. For 3 hours we hardly get any time to take in the characters just being in a scene.

### Nolanery
This complex, interleaved narrative structure is what Nolan is known for, but I think the movie strains under the weight of this format. So much screen time and dialogue goes to showing us the inner workings of this political attack that is ultimately just a petty smear campaign. Bland details are shown, then reshown, then re-litigated again in hearings to tie down this messy structure.

###Yeah, Science Bitch!
The movie is so long and it exposits so aggressively, why is the science is reduced to pure mysticism. Christopher Nolan seems obsessed with realism so I don't get why these genius men and women are relegated to speaking in platitudes about the science they devoted their lives to study.

### Why This Story?
About half the movie is focused on Lewis Strauss' attempts to smear Oppenheimer. We the audience do not hold the fervent anti-communist views of America at that time. We don't care if Oppie is a communist or not. This hearing is a natural framing device as Oppie's past is combed through and exploited, but why on earth do we focus on the precise details of who wrote what memo to whom based on which leaked document.

### Why not other stories?
The making of the atom bomb involved some truly fascinating events and many brilliant scientists, but they all show up in the movie almost like cameos. Here's Feynman, here's Leo Szilard, here's Fermi, here in the corner is Pile 1, and oh my God is that Moon Knight? I can respect that Nolan stuck to Oppie's story (he was only around for certain events at certain times), except I can't respect that because the whole second half of the movie is about fucking Lewis Strauss!

### Why not more Oppenheimer?
Oppenheimer was a weird, fascinating dude. He considered the Bhaghavad Gita to be one of the books that most shaped his philosophy of life. In the movie it comes up as a curiosity that leads into a sex scene, why not show more? The story is about a warrior named Arjuna hesitating before a large battle. His charioteer, Krinsha (an avatar of Vishnu depending on who you ask), counsels him. Krishna is ""death, destroyer of worlds"" and he says that Arjuna would only be slaying men Krishna had already taken. Arjuna needed not mourn the many he would have to kill, their lives already belonged to the infinite devourer of all things. Too bad that story has no bearing on the themes of this movie /s.

### Visions and Imaginings
Like I said, those pulsing, whirring visual cutaways were awesome. Why did they just stop? Was it so we could go to the Strauss Housse? They lent such magic to the first few beats of the movie and then they abated. There were so many elements of the Manhattan project that could've been visualized in this way (lookup explosive lens). Moreover, Oppenheimer cared about things other than the bomb, we could've also been treated to mystical visions relating to his deep interest in Hinduism. Or why not some vision like this one from Dr Michihiko Hachiya who survived the atom bomb: 

> It seems I was in Tokyo after the great earthquake and around me were decomposing bodies heaped in piles, all of whom were looking right at me. I saw an eye sitting on the palm of a girl’s hand. Suddenly it turned and leaped into the sky and then came flying back towards me, so that, looking up, I could see a great bare eyeball, bigger than life, hovering over my head, staring point blank at me. I was powerless to move.

How much more captivating could this narrative have been if we were allowed into all of Oppenheimer's thoughts, not just the ones Nolan thought were interesting.

### The Trinity Test
It was certainly different, perhaps the promotional material over-emphasized the scene's importance, but I can't help but feel like that scene was intended to be a big moment. Nolan certainly likes his set-pieces and he spent a great deal of time and money trying to get it right. But man did it fall flat for me.
We've all seen footage of real nuclear explosions. It seemed like Nolan was trying his darndest to recreate it ""in camera"" to seemingly no purpose. Why not just use the existing trinity footage and gussy it up a bit? He's filming something that's already been filmed without really choosing a new perspective. He had so many options to make this scene a bit less lame:

* Show some of the peripheral details that we haven't seen before, the blast echoing off of mountains, a massive valley being illuminated with the brightness of day. The cloud lingering after sunrise. Some of the weird gizmos the scientists had to get their own measurements of the blast tonnage (Fermi had some setup with strips of paper if I recall correctly).

* If you're going for a more grounded and realistic vision, give us that rather than a set of cuts that intersperse closeups and several different perspectives. Give us some time to take in the blast for ourselves.

* Give your actors some time to sit in the aftermath and give us some sense of the human impact of the thing.

* Use some physics driven simulations to give us something that isn't just a hollywood gasoline fireball.

* Intersperse some of those cutaways I talked about earlier of atoms smashing or the explosive lens lensing.

### Hiroshima and Nagasaki

To Nolan's credit, this film does reflect the historical fact the bombs were dropped not just to end the war but also show our power to the soviets. Many historians argue that Japan was on the precipice of surrender before the weapons were deployed.

I think Nolan made the wrong choice not showing the bombings in some way. The charred corpse and burned face I think were not sufficient. We needed some sort of vision, depiction, description, or reaction beyond what was presented. The very end of the movie is this fiery vision of doomsday, we ignore that fact that the same doomsday was already unleashed, and that our government would've unleashed it again and again on whoever they could've if the soviets hadn't developed their own weapons.

Many victims in Hiroshima were effectively melted but did not die right away. They lingered in blind agony, pawing with macerated limbs for their children and their parents who were dead or left as moaning faceless ghouls. Rivers of corpses ran red then black with the sooty fallout that came down afterwards. Nolan did not shock and upset us nearly enough, these scenes should've been excruciating. 

This movie's trailers sold it using the atom bomb, not Oppenheimer's chaotic and influential life. I think it's fair to say that the bomb is what drew a lot of folks into the theater in the first place. You cannot make a story about the bomb and gloss over it's true victims like this. It's irresponsible, and it supposes the scariest thing is an imagined apocalypse rather than the real ones our government triumphantly wrought on cities full of civilians.

But that's the power of the bomb. No nation, no matter how cruel, can ignore that using these weapons guarantees doom for everyone. We are powerless before the infinite maw of death, devourer of all things, destroyer of worlds. The greatest invention of the last century may still save us. But we cannot forget the lives it destroyed.

"Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but the people calling it boring are definitely missing the point. I can understand why they may feel that way, but it also goes to show  just how little the general public knows or appreciates  its own countries history. As someone who studies political science, the nuclear treaties are actually the most well followed international agreements 

 I appreciate the restraint in not showing Hiroshima or Nagasaki being bombed and just the Trinity test. Seeing the two bombs being transported in shaky trucks was more unerving than actually seeing the blasts again. 

I also appreciated how Kitty Oppenheimer didn't have some historonic reaction learning about his affair with Pugh when she had cheated on her husband with Oppenheimer. It was fascinating seeing him interact with Niels Bohr and Einstein  and Enrico Fermi. Even knowing they were real people, they've almost become mythical figures at this point. The three interwoven stories were also a master stroke in structure. 

I would have like to see more of the smear job with senator Mcarthy and J Edgar Hoivers' involvement but felt the private committee kangaroo court did an effective job.",2023-07-22 22:29:44
"

Unpopular opinion: Oppenheimer was kinda clickbait

Im a bit dissapointed because I was expecting a lot more physics and engineering in the movie and problem solving. Instead we got a more personal approach, with moral and psychological struggles in the focus and the boring capitalists vs commies conflict.I dont think thats bad per se but that wasnt how the movie was presented in advertisiment. I put the blame on the overwhelming ads that just put the expectations in the wrong direction which just ruined the experience in the cinema for me a bit. The ending was probably the best part of the movie for me I must say. So to conclude, if i knew the movie was like it was, I would watch it from a different perspective and enjoyed it more. It isnt truly made for science geeks. Feel free to disagree with me here.",2023-07-24 12:56:40

My wife and I both agree that this probably would have been more enjoyable as a high quality TV miniseries. Stretch out more of his romance with Jean before the Los Alamos, His connection and leaning towards communism, etc. Make it a 4-5 1hr episodes.  
We both really liked it a lot, the story was good the history and background. But we left the theatre thinking we probably would have enjoyed this on our TV instead.",2023-07-30 01:27:11

"Can I say something without getting downvoted into oblivion?

I didn't like it all that much. It did some things incredibly well. All the acting was great. The run time didn't bother me. Film making aspect of it was all great and what you expect from Nolan.

I just didn't find myself caring about Oppenheimer at all. I dont care about his love life or his relationships. I dont care about the communist party aspect or how the world sees him or his legacy. The most interesting thing about the movie to me is answering whether or not it's morally correct to even create such a weapon, and once that's covered, the rest did not interest me at all. Suddenly, it turns into a political ""thriller"" that I wasn't all that thrilled about. Somehow, out of nowhere, Downey is the bad guy, and the explanation of that felt rushed to me even in a 3 hour movie. It was just random and didn't resonate with me. I just didn't care.

I guess I wanted something a little more fictitious that was just set around that part of history. I thought it would have some more Nolan flare and something more sci-fi-esque would be happening. But no, it's just a run of the mill biopic type movie.

I didnt out right hate it, and maybe I have to give it another shot later to see what I missed because apparently it's fantastic, and it just didn't scratch my itch.

Things I liked: the bomb scene is Immaculate super well done. The visual and visceral PTSD depiction he felt after making it was great. The stuff with the other scientists was great. But too much on the love life and the political aspect turned me off. His wife's big connecting ""we've been through fire together"" Moment is that she helped him greive over the death of the chick he was fucking on the side. Insane to me. Lol

Idk it was meh to fine, I guess.

Nowhere near Interstellar, Dunkirk, Memento, The Prestige and Inception for me.",2023-07-29 03:36:36

Knowing the physics, history and having experience how such technical project is approached I couldn‘t name a single thing which was done well.

"I’m starting to feel like Nolan is an excellent magician. He’s so good at wrapping a product in an excellent package to manipulate you into thinking it’s good, but once you unwrap the unnecessarily intricate packaging you find a fairly pedestrian product that can’t figure out what it is. It’s like learning the secret behind a great magic trick, a magic trick that was fairly disappointing to begin with. There’s so much slight of hand to cover up his own weaknesses: messing with the timeline to make you think about the story more than you really need to by forcing you to stitch things together as it goes on, blowing through dialogue so you don’t realize how much of it is totally canned, female characters that are played like cliche scenery rather than real people. 

The time jumps make it feel like he’s ripping the pages out of a book and throwing them on the floor for you to read just for the sake of unnecessarily challenging the reader.",2023-07-21 12:53:35
"It was a good movie and I enjoyed it. However, I feel like it was way too long. Some scenes were repeated 3-4 times, where 2 would have sufficed. I feel like this would have been a great mini-series, but it just jams too much information. I see why they needed to do the colour/ black and white distinction, but it's also jumping in time within the different times, which makes it very confusing. 

The directing, acting, effects were simply fantastic.

"Am I crazy for saying that the movie didn’t really have anything new or profound to say about the dangers of humans having nuclear warheads? Everyone is saying the ending scene hit so hard but we’ve known humanity having nuclear weapons was a mistake for decades & it’s a theme/subject that’s been explored dozens of times in media already. Maybe that scene specifically was just supposed to be showing Oppenheimer’s guilt over that fact but idk didn’t have the impact for me that it apparently had for some. 

Very good movie overall still but I didn’t find it as groundbreaking as some people here.",2023-07-23 14:18:08
"it may be my favorite bomb explosion scene in a movie ever, even more so considering it being all practical  

as someone very familiar with the history of oppenheimer im glad i heard about the color scenes being subjective / black and white being objective so that i didnt have to worry too much about inaccuracies.  and to be fair they went above and beyond because sometimes the dialogue in color scenes was taken directly from what we know happened but because they changed the context somewhat or didnt want to have jarring transistions midscene if the followed it up with fiction they kept it in color   

i wish the sscene with truman was clearer, ive always taken that interaction as truman getting mad because he thought oppenheimer saw themselves as equals and he wanted to put oppenheimer back in his place but the group i was with walked away thinking he was just trying to be a good leader and take the burden of guilt off Oppenheimer  

also one of the prevailing messages of the movie, which was subtle at times and somtimes less, was the idea that being apolitical is in fact a political choice.  oppenheimer truly seemed to want to make arguements to american politicians and the world at large after the war and just be like 'because science and logic' and in the end he got crucified for not playing the political game.  fast foward to covid and ppl literally injected themselves with horse dewormer instead of the crowning medical achievement of the millennium (so far) because scientists said trust the science to a country where 50% of the population couldnt pass middle school biology",2023-07-23 16:07:33
"I saw Oppenheimer! I’m a huge cosmology/quantum physics nerd so I was stoked to see this movie for months.

Great but not perfect. Trinity nuke test was awesome—the most hyped scene. Some of the special effects of Oppy’s dreaming of quantum physics were cool too. Movie’s focus was highly on Oppy’s communist ties and holes in Los Alamos’s security, as well as Oppy’s bomb test and regrets about building the bomb.

I have some criticisms but only because my expectations were so high:

>!Nothing about why Oppy and company liked socialism/communism besides unionization. If that’s the only reason then well, ok. Nothing about how Einstein also liked socialism/communism. Probably didn’t want to piss off half of America trying to give the one valid defense of socialism/communism that most Americans will ever see in their entire lives.!<

>!Super duper quick explanations of quantum physics, star fusion and supernova. I’m talking 5 seconds on each, tops. No mention of E = mc², which its most prominent usage is in nuclear physics! I’m not expecting an episode of Cosmos but I doubt having a few extra seconds would’ve spoiled the movie’s pacing. Missed chance at some needed science education.!<

>!Nothing about Oppy not winning the Nobel Prize (although it’s implied it’s due to the witch hunt).!<

>!Nothing about Oppy translating the Bhagavad Gita (although Oppy is shown reading Sanskrit once, plus the “I am become death” quote).!<

>!Didn’t walk around the Trinity detonation site afterwards.!<

>!Los Alamos appeared rather small given there were 6,000 employees there irl.!<

>!No Louis Slotin poking around at Demon Core. Nobody shown dying of radiation. Oppy’s nightmare sequence was pretty good but it about as “low budget” as it gets. Heck I don’t even think anyone dies on camera besides Oppy’s GF.!<

>!Not much about Oppy’s and Heisenberg being friends prior to the war, and Heisenberg being recruited by the Nazis.!<

>!The 4th quarter with Robert Downey Jr and the committee grilling Oppy was too long. Just cut to the chase—“Hehad communist sympathies, he was apprehensive about the nuclear arms race, he let the Soviet spy slip, and Edward Teller ratted him out. GUILTY! Clearance revoked.”!<

>!Nothing about Oppy’s dwindling health and weight loss during the course of the Manhattan project.!<

>!Oppy’s communist GF committing suicide was kinda eh, just thrown in there to give Oppy another reason to cry. Red herring.!<

>!Hiroshima and Nagasaki are never shown. You see the cockpit of the Ebola Gay for 5 seconds but that’s it. Stalin and USSR are also never shown (my complaints are getting petty by now).!<

I give it an 8/10 because of Cillian Murphy and how powerful some scenes were. A director’s cut would be 9/10, it’s just a matter of adding or replacing a few necessary scenes. I mean, *I get it,* I’m not expecting fluff like >!fully detailed scenes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki getting nuked!< because of time and money constraints. But if it had, it would’ve been fucking perfect. Think Threads all over again.

The closest movie to this one would be the JFK movie and how it was a past retelling of what happened before, during, after the JFK assassination, except replace the assassination with the Trinity test.

An aside: >!This movie was clearly meant for smart and privy viewers, as it really went through lots of characters that I couldn’t fully follow, and *I even knew about Oppy and friends beforehand.* So if the movie is operating under the assumption that the audience isn’t stupid, then *go for it.* Tell us every gritty detail. No need to dumb down the science or politics for the mainstream viewer.!<

>!Also this movie was rated R for…sex scenes and that’s it. For a movie that culminates in the death of 140,000 people, it really doesn’t appear to be an R-rated movie besides the aforementioned sex scenes. !<

I know it’s a wall of text but we’re talking about the biggest budget science film in years so yeah, I’m gonna get a bit passionate about it.",2023-07-24 22:34:38

"As my mom said ""It's a movie i'd have to watch twice to really understand."" and she's right unless you already know the story which i didn't it's hard to follow, >!jumping between the 40's and 50's before giving the context of how they relate really fucked a lot of the movie for me!<, like i might just be an idiot which is more then possible but i was very confused and it sounded like a lot of the people in my theatre were too.

Once i got the story in order it was a very enjoyable movie the cinematography and depth of most scene's were fantastic but the only gripes i have are the sex/nudity scenes and the bomb. The movie wasn't raunchy, or romance filled, or what ever the fuck 50 shades of grey is, like i don't even think there were any real light hearted moments so the sex and nudity scenes felt very awkward and misplaced. >!The Bomb scene felt a lot like Godzilla 2014 except in Godzilla 2014 you see Godzilla at the end instead there's a lot of upclose fire shots but they completely miss the staple of what an atomic bomb is and that's probably purposeful to focus on Oppenheimer but at the same time i'd of much rather swapped the sex scenes for a decent portrayal of the explosion, the power, the heat, and the classic mushroom cloud!<

"Best movie since COVID to watch in a theater, another masterpiece from Nolan.

The story timeline somewhat resembles Godfather II, but it all happened to one single person. The movie contains almost everything about the scientist, not only his career and researches, but also his ideology, philosophy and personal life, which are indispensable to his career achievement. Oppy can be described as a humanitarian with sympathy toward Socialism, despite making the most deadly weapon ever of human history. He was a clean man compared to those making accuses based on jealousy or reputation laundering.

About Admiral Strauss (RDJ): This is arguably one of the most memorable villain on film in the decade. At certain point, he was portrayed as a reliable colleague or even friend, and even Oppy himself was deceived. He deserves all the B/W treatment throughout the film for a Janus-faced character. RDJ deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor next year.

Two spotlights: Rami Malek's Doctor Hill appears to be a minion character accompanying Fermi, but turned out to be a crucial testifier proving Oppenheimer's innocence. Gary Oldman transforms himself again, this time as President Truman.",2023-08-07 04:01:46

I won't type out spoilers here. I'll just give a few notes. 

The Oscar for best score goes to... (It's still early) but THIS!

The amount of dread I felt through the first two hours almost brought me to tears. I just... I don't know how humans haven't already destroyed the Earth already. I felt Oppenheimer on all accounts. This film will definitely stick with me. 

Emily Blunt - RDJ - Matt Damon - Cillian Murphy - ALL STARS!

It didn't feel like 3 hours to me but as hour 3 started, I thought that would drag the movie down. It did in some ways but the amount of rage I had toward Truman, RDJ, and all of the panel/prosecutors in the room. I honestly don't think an Oppenheimer movie would be complete without that 3rd act. 

Inception is at the top of my list of Nolan films. I like everything else but Inception... man, I love that movie. I think this movie is going to hang up there at the top with it.

The last 1/3rd of the movie is somehow as tense as the the bomb going off. Albert Einstein was ridiculously good for his time on screen. Oppies eyes in this movie are borderline moving. If he had a blank face and just his eyes all of his emotions would still win awards. The female characters deliver  so hard. It’s like undermining them just to regret it every time, it just happened. The dialogue had this fluidity to it that was borderline 80s comic level. Just quick, precise, and hungry across the board. The sense of self dread throughout the movie is wild. I’ve never seen anything where the main character is “first person” in accounts while simultaneously making every supporting character feel as real or as valid. Lastly.. the fucking marbles?!?!?

"Great Movie. Christopher Nolan has beautiful visual effects that are done without a lot of computer generated imagery, Sound design which is great, fantastic acting and especially awesome performances by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Junior

There's  also some really great ageing of the characters, which really surprised me. Can't tell if it was cgi or prosthetics

There's also questions about the future of mass destruction in weapons, but ultimately it's a drama about the humans who create the mass destruction and their thoughts and feelings. It could be seen as a pre cursor to artificial general intelligence, or hypothetical research as to how it could happen

Story is okay. Wasn't a massive fan of the dialogue, but I think this movie requires multiple viewings to really understand it, I could be wrong. Also the pacing was killing me, maybe my attention span is in the bin, but I really felt the length

And yes this is made for IMAX, watch it on IMAX. You will feel your seat rumble during the explosions and practical visual effects. So worth it

"overall i really enjoyed it. but i think it was overwhelming in a way that made it hard to fully love. 

i think it was kind of confusing to keep up with. the dialogue is nonstop and especially in the first act it was moving so fast. so many random names to keep track of across different timelines and in different accents with Nolan’s infamous disregard for proper mixing. so many characters popping in and out while im not entirely sure on who they were because they were introduced in the blink of an eye and with 25% of the dialogue being missed.

i dont agree with the people who seem to think that it was boring, or bad, or disappointing.

the movie is called *Oppenheimer*. Of course it is mainly about him and his life. the third act is important because it shows us how he has to deal with all the bullshit and fallout from his creation. Most people knew him and that he made the bomb, not very many people knew about the shit his own government put him through afterwards.

"My main gripe was the sheer number of names the audience had to keep up with, I found myself struggling at times to remember who they referencing and the pace of the movie didn't help. I get it, that was the story but still, could have been handled better.

The last half hour felt rushed and a bit all over the place. It's almost as if they realized that the length was already substantial and just decided to up the already strong pace even further and speed-run it. People have mentioned that scenes weren't allowed to digest fully before moving on and I agree with that, I felt like the test scene needed more time, especially the blast and immediate aftermath. The lack of a mushroom cloud was strange too, considering how much of an icon it would become in the early Cold War era.

I enjoyed it but I wasn't blown away, which is ironic considering the subject manner. Solid performances all around, I liked Damon as the disdainful military man who wanted results and nothing else. I'd watch it if it was on TV but it's not something I'd go out of my way to see again.",2023-07-22 14:53:57

I was very underwhelmed with the trinity scene, there was no reason to see this in Imax. The noise of the foot stomping was louder and far more memorable.

But Cilian and RDJ just too good for words",2023-07-27 18:55:56
I was really into it the first hour but after that I got a little bored.  Maybe if it were focused on just one of the stories I would have enjoyed it more.

The twist and reveal of the conversation with Albert somehow didn’t matter that much to me, as they wanted to. 

I think that Schindlers list is an appropriate comparison, but the List was so much better makes you so invested in the characters and somehow has an universal message about the war and world in general. I felt that was missing here.",2023-07-31 15:06:08

"It's a pretty good movie-great for history buffs, science nerds and Cilian fans. Great performances by all, with RDJ being the standout. Excellent cinematography by Hoytema, as usual. Great soundtrack too. The movie was never dull despite its runtime thanks to the pacing.

But God, was some of the dialogue unbearable. Too expository, too stilted and sometimes even cringey. Scientists don't talk that way to each other. A lot of discussions were dumbed down way too much for the general audiences. I think someone like Sorkin would've done a better job. And the name drops were quite insufferable. Especially John F Kennedy's at the end. It was so unnatural, the way they bring his name up over all the other senators who held out.",2023-07-21 10:07:08
"It looks like I'm in the minority here, but I thought this movie was painfully average. There were a few striking moments, and the last 4 or 5 minutes with Oppenheimer and Einstein was amazing.

But there were a lot of moments that felt like they didn't reach their full potential. For example, the scene where Oppenheimer is being applauded by everyone in the gymnasium wasn't nearly as good as it could have been. I thought it was going to do something amazing when the woman's flesh was being seared, and then Oppenheimer stumbled on the charred corpse... but then he walks outside and some random dude is throwing up, and then it ends. It would have been more impactful if everyone in the audience was slowly disintegrating and everything was destroyed when he got outside (or something else like that).

I feel like the movie didn't give us enough of a reason to care about the relationship between Oppenheimer and the politician that RDJ played, so developments in the last part of the movie  kind of fell flat for me. Also, RDJ had a **horrible** line of dialogue that made me laugh out loud in the theater: something along the lines of ""he knew I would make him the most famous person in the history of the world!!!""",2023-07-21 22:33:41
"Listen up, Nolan fanboys: just because it's Nolan doesn't mean it's *good*.

The overarching story itself (Oppy vs. Strauss) is interesting and Downey is amazing, but the journey to get there is a minefield of *incredibly* awkward and unnatural dialogue.  At few points do two characters have an actual conversation as two human beings would.  Instead they exchange clipped exposition as quickly as possible and move on to the next scene.  Occasionally Nolan will throw in a flashback to whomever the two characters are discussing - helpful, but amateurish.

Nolan likes to bite off more than he can chew (see: Interstellar, Tenet), but someone's got to reign him in for his next project.

And - Jack Quaid was wasted in this film.",2023-07-21 23:02:57

You gotta distinct when something is “boring” and “not for you”.

That being said, this was a fantastic movie, albeit, not flawless. Cillian Murphy absolutely killed it.",2023-07-23 07:05:58
"Does anyone else feel like this movie executed one of the most successful social media marketing campaigns of all time to construct a narrative that this movie is a masterpiece?  Not just a masterpiece, but one that must be viewed on the big screen and in 70 mm IMAX if possible.

Cillian's performance was superb, but the rest of the film was dull, droning and forgettable.  There was no reason to see this on a big screen.  I waited for a month to be able to get a ticket to see it on 70 mm IMAX, and the ticket was like $27.  I  feel swindled and wish I just saw it in a standard theater for a fraction of the price.  I can't remember a single scene in the movie that benefitted from the IMAX experience.  Maybe the gym scene with the stomping?  In fact, I think I would have enjoyed it more at home on a TV or laptop where I could take a break from the tedium of the film.  I'm curious to see how people will remember this movie in a year or two.",2023-08-21 19:12:20
apparently it's just me but every scene was so over dramatic. And then after ever piece of over dramatic dialog was delivered massive string instruments would start blaring.

I think I have realized that I'm just not a fan of Christopher Nolan anymore.,2023-07-21 23:32:56
"Equal parts great and frustrating. The opening act/first 45 mins is very rushed - much to the detriment of getting the audience invested with the characters outside Oppenheimer/Murphy.

People are lauding it's sound design and I agree to an extent, but the bulk of the films soundstage drowns out much of the dialogue in typical (and frankly amateur) Nolan fashion.

The biggest issue I have with this film though is Emily Blunt and Matt Damon feeling like mis-casts. I prefer when Nolan didn't rely on Hollywood names to sell his movie and instead used reputable names but in a way that gave a film a more unique experience. Like, fuck, I've seen Matt Damon and Emily Blunt in too many damn blockbusters to give a damn about their role in this movie.

Also, I'm incredibly disappointed with Nolan not pushing the envelope with the depiction on how the construction of the atomic bomb killed 250k+ innocent Japanese civilians. Sure, it's talked about and you can sense ""some"" implicated remorse through Murphy's character and dialogue but the overall execution and almost complete dismissal of the significance of the only time we used atomic bombs on people (the Japanese) would be like watching Schindler's List without any of the gripping scenes of Jewish brutality at the hands of the Nazis that made the film so harrowing and engrossing. Instead, we get political mind games and scheming that out stays it's welcome.

I'd give Oppenheimer a 7/10.

It's good, but nowhere near great.",2023-07-21 23:55:50
"A masterpiece. My eyes were glued on the screen. The music. The cinematography. The ""can you hear the music"" scene. The way they keep cutting to different scenes.

"That was the most ""Tell, Don't Show"" movie I've ever seen. Every single scene is an unending stream of characters explaining what they are doing and feeling in that moment.

""As you know, I am from the XYZ department, and I'm here to get you to do something different.""

""Well as you and the XYZ department know, Character, the science tells us we must do it this way.""

""What if we did it a third way? As you know, I'm from the ABC division. I thought a third way was possible.""

""Promising. I know, as you all know, that this third way is significant. We will go in that direction now.""

""I cannot work with this new direction. I am temperamental and also German, as you know.""

""I have a new science factoid.""

""I knew that.""

"Just got out of the theater.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I did not give *a shit* about the hearing stuff. I feel like Nolan had two visions for this film: Oppenheimer's life and his reputation, and they got smashed together in an ultra-lengthy way. Definitely could've shaved an hour off the runtime. In my view, the film should've ended with the scene where he's giving the speech and he's imagining the bomb killing everyone in front of him, and then he walks out and sees his colleagues crying/vomiting.

Nevertheless, I really liked the movie. Excellent cinematography, casting and acting, and pacing of the first half. The use of sound was very unique and the withholding of sound during the test sequence and speech scene were powerful. My whole theater, which laughed and commented a lot, was dead silent during these scenes. 8/10.",2023-07-23 05:02:36
[deleted],2023-07-23 05:58:50
"There's a grear movie in there but I don't feel like it was found and so we get an overly long good movie. 

It's nice to know I wasn't the only one with sound issues. There's times background footsteps drown out dialogue, the echoing effect of microphones and some rooms with a score that was over balanced just didn't work for me.

I bet most audience members can't name 5 non-obvious (only about three obvious ones) characters even though there are two dozen.

Once again, timeline fuckery was just confusing and unnecessary. 

For a biopic, it needed to focus on a vertical and never does. It's becoming a theme from the Nolan's, for me, to open interesting lines and never fully explore or comment on them.

Score was brilliant but over mixed. Visuals were fantastic. Performances were impeccable. 

I thought there was a better film beneath what we got and an ever better one that could have been written.",2023-07-24 06:45:45
"Call me a big dumb nerdy man if you want but personally I was much more interested in the splitting of the atom, creating the most destructive bomb in human history and winning world war 2 than I was in McCarthyism and the human drama behind how Oppenheimer didn't have his security clearance renewed.

Also no really impressive visuals whatsoever, the test and the actual atom splitting were big disappointments for me.

I think this film was a bit of a let down in multiple ways.

Acting was great ofc but then with Damon, Cillian Murphy, Blunt RDJ etc there was no danger of that. Dialogue got on my nerves at times some of the faux profound one liners seemed a bit ham fisted.

Also I know it's an artistic thing some directors like but I HATE when the soundtrack is louder than the dialogue and bloody black and white, for me it just makes it more difficult to watch.",2023-07-24 08:36:14
"I'm very conflicted on the movie. On the one hand, I *think* I liked it? But the more I actually think about it, the more bad things spring to mind. 

I saw someone mention that the first 2 hours of the movie felt like a really long trailer, and I can't help but think that's really accurate. the movie is just constantly bashing you over the head with cuts, more and more dialogue, intense blaring music trying to tell you what's happening on screen is actually really insightful and a constant sense of smug self-importance. During the third act of the film, there is a long winded section where actors are just explaining the plot to eachother. Mostly when Strauss and his aide are discussing the situation, with loud horns in the background for 20 minutes. 

Like many others have said, the trinity explosion was underwhelming. 

The development of the atomic bomb and the technical trials of the manhattan project could have used some more attention. Everytime I see someone mention this, the response is ''well this isn't a movie about the manhattan project''. I'm sorry, but it is. Or rather, it is if you can believe the marketing. Stop telling people that they are shallow if they are going to this movie expecting it to focus more on the development of the atomic bomb. The development of the atomic bomb was **the** focal point of Oppenheimer's life, and I feel it should have been focussed on more rather than the loss of his security clearance. 

I also wasn't a fan of how Einstein was used. It feels like he was a marvel hero making cameos the whole time. That scene where the car drives out of view to reveal Einstein standing behind it in particular.  I was expecting the Avengers theme to start blaring every time he came on screen.  

Another thing I didn't like is how the physics were portrayed in the movie. I don't mean the physics of the bomb, I mean the actual physics behind the development. There is a scene early on where oppenheimer explains quantum mechanics to a single student. He mentions that quantum mechanics is paradoxical. ""this cannot be, but it is. That's quantum mechanics"" or something along those lines. Then he starts writing a few formulae on the blackboard, and you see the student smile with a look of ''holy shit, this man is a genius''. That is not how physics works. You don't just sit around a table, say ''QUANTUM MECHANICS IS CRAZY YALL!!"" and frantically start writing stuff on a blackboard. I get that it's difficult to make a subject like this interesting for the big screen, but this is just not how science works. Same with the scene in the start where they ask oppenheimer if he 'hears the music'. Science, chemistry and physics are not like that. It's not something that you just feel and improvise through, it's study, math, more study and more math. I do research (not exactly into quantum mechanics or anything like that. I mostly work on new treatment techniques for pollution) and I have published papers, so anytime I see science portrayed like this it feels almost insulting. I'm sorry, but if you are bad at math you can't compensate for that by just ''feeling'' the physics or something like that. 

Speaking of blaring, the soundtrack is good but very overused. There were a lot of dry dialogue scenes that they tried to spice up by putting very intense music over it, which feels rather cheap. 

Overall, writing it out like this, I think I did not like the movie much. It felt very pretentious, as though it's riding on the clout of being about Oppenheimer. The entire time the movie is huffing its own farts about how artsy it is, and even writing critisism like this I expect someone to tell me I'm just too stupid to understand the utter brilliance that is Oppenheimer.",2023-07-25 11:01:42
"The movie felt simultaneously fast-paced and super slow drag. 

The dialogue moved quickly and if you missed a few lines/words, you end up confused. The constant time jumps were hard to follow at times. But also the movie felt like it could've benefited from being about 45 minutes shorter. They didn't need to dedicate all that time in the 2nd half for the court proceedings.

Overall, I give it a 5/10. There were some elements I really liked, namely the 1st half of the movie and the scenes portraying the emotional turmoil Oppenheimer was going through due to making this bomb. The 2nd half and parts of the 1st half were such a boring drag though. Like we get it, he had close family/friends that were in the communist party, but he is not a traitor.",2023-07-26 11:52:54

"Saw it last night. I know I was meant to like the film, but I just didn't. Reasons:

* slow start
* editing - very quick scenes darting from one to another and at different times. Got confusing
* very heavy on the dialogue, which was hampered by the incessant music/score in the background
* boring plots - I really didn't care much for the delay in the security clearance or the inquisition Oppenheimer received about his connection with communists
* not enough detail about the development of the bomb and the difficulties they faced building it.

Anyway, just my opinion. Please don't be upset if you disagree.",2023-07-28 05:33:30
"I feel like if we could compare this to another film it would the imitation game and that was a far better film than this. This movie felt so different over dramatic for all the wrong reasons, we barely spent anytime with any character that it felt hard to understand what anyone’s motives were. Was his wife an alcoholic adulterer who regretted marrying Robert? Yet later she’s defending him and getting mad he’s not defending himself. She’s only shown being a massive bitch to the point I wondered why they are married.

The story is also hard to follow if you don’t have prior knowledge of what is happening with all the communist stuff and security issues. I had to watch an explanation video after walking out of the theatre to even understand the ending. 

Also the sex scenes were painfully cringe and I can imagine Nolan sniffing his own farts as he films them sat naked in the hotel or having sex in the interview room for no reason. “And then she stops having sex with him to walk over to the book shelf, pull out a random book that has the film quote it in, BRAP, SNIFFFF, oh fuck I’m good”",2023-07-29 18:53:21
"I've been trying to figure out how to describe it after just walking outt. At first ""impressionistic"" came to mind but it's too muscular and aggressive for that. I've landed on ""dialectical"". This is what I imagine Eisenstein would do with $100m if he were alive (though Carl Dreyer seems in their too with the number of Cillian Murphy closeups in full frame).

It's a thoroughly exhausting film, both intellectually and physically.  But rhythmic tension only goes so far and, at a certain point, dissipates if it keeps going on. I wasn't immediately a fan of Dunkirk but on my second viewing I got in sync with it and now I think that film is a masterpiece. I guess the same could happen with Oppenheimer but it seems unlikely. The rhythmic experimentation is just hard to sustain for 3 hours of tension.",2023-07-30 05:46:23
"I felt like I was watching a three hour long trailer. 
The way the scenes were succeeding each other, jumping in time or place a bit too often. And music in the background all the time.

I am sorry for anyone who paid extra to watch this movie in IMAX.,2023-11-14 03:17:50
"I’m feeling a 6/10 at best on this one, I’m generally a big Nolan fan too but I think this is his worst film honestly. 

Really meandering pace, the time skipping cuts are bordering on confusing, dialogue generally forgettable. Movie somehow drags at the last 30-45 mins which was the most interesting part. 

Genuinely think the script was just bad, I thought that despite the insane cast that all the actors were underutilized and forgettable. Murphy gives a good performance as Oppenheimer but he’s characterized in so many different ways in this film it’s pretty strange. 

He doesn’t seem to have a consistent personality or way he acts besides being aloof a lot of the time and not in an interesting way. His familial relationship is implied to be shitty but his wife only exists to act exasperated and crazy while being a housewife stereotype? Pretty weak imo 

Just overall not compelling whatsoever to me, big Nolan fan but I think a 6 is generous on this one",2023-07-21 02:47:21
"My thoughts:

1. The story is kind of disjointed. There are two plot arcs - the creation of the bomb and the changing public perspective on Oppenheimer. The creation of the bomb arc is great. The politicking arc is…. Weak. The stakes aren’t properly laid out (I.e., why is Oppie losing his security clearance such a devastating blow? Why is it even beneficial for Strauss to put effort into destroying Oppies reputation?)

2. Along those lines there were some weaknesses in the plot development. The first 45 minutes seems to suggest Strauss is having to defend himself for having a positive relationship with Oppenheimer… then suddenly the tables turn? And Hill, the apparently sole witness that testified against Strauss… where the hell was he all movie? Sure he poked his head up once or twice but for such a minor character to be the sole downfall of Strauss seemed silly

The heel turn by Strauss’ aide is also rather absurd.

And generally Strauss was a shit “villain”. If 15 minutes of exposition at the end of the movie is required to explain a bad guys motives, he’s a poorly written bad guy. And that’s exactly what we got.

3. The entire third act just drags. Way too much exposition, way too much “finishing scenes from earlier but with an unexpected twist”.

4. I’ve already whined about it with Strauss but character development!! The wife Kitty goes from being a useless drunk that he’s stuck with because he knocked her up to being the most badass character in the final 30 minutes. There was almost nothing to support her sudden attitude shift in the hearing scene. 

5. Man the whole security clearance thing just bugs me. Oppenheimer is the head of the Manhattan project, months into development, already has LoS Alamos built and has assembled his team… and he doesn’t have clearance yet? I don’t know the historical accuracy of that but it seems like some creative liberty to add to the drama. But it makes all the drama about him LOSING security clearance at a time he’s apparently no longer involved in the AEC even sillier 

I dunno. I give it like a 6/10 because I saw it on IMAX. I think a home viewing would be a 4/10.

I think the movie would have been much better served by focusing on the making of the bomb or on Oppenheimers public perception and internal turmoil regarding the making of the bomb.

Also a quick perusal of the Google and IMDB reviews suggests to me one of the most overwhelming bot campaigns to fluff a movie I’ve ever seen. Just PAGES AND PAGES of ChatGPT responses to “write a positive review about Oppenheimer” regurgitating the same buzz words over and over",2023-07-21 13:57:04
"This was boring and way longer than need be.

I guess I foolishly assumed that the bomb, Manhattan Project, and WW2 would be the main foci of this movie, not Oppenheimer’s love life or a meeting in the mid-50s about renewing his security clearance. I also don’t think there was any reason for a nonlinear narrative. 

The movie was super interesting for 10 minutes, then boring for 25, then interesting for 10, boring for 25, and so on for 3 hours. All in all, makes for a less-than-interesting film.",2023-07-25 11:03:13
"I can't help but think this is a missed opportunity.

I thought there'd be a twist, or at least a sharp deviation from established history/science, like the interstellar bookcase.

When it became clear that it was instead essentially just a well acted dramatization, I thought they'd lean into the messaging more and use the opportunity to share en masse with a general population that the prospect of nuclear war is terrifying, and that it is not an abstract concept. The explosion alone was clearly supposed to do that, but frankly it wasnt enough - we're completely numbed to blockbuster explosions, it didn't feel any more real than any other cinema explosion. They should have doubled down on his paranoia and shown us explicitly the effects of these things. They barely scratched the surface with what we did get.

I enjoyed it for what it was, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this to anybody, really.

Edit: alright guys, I get it. I had a pretty sizable pre-existing interest in this particular subject area so maybe I just let my expectations get too high. It just wasn't made for me, and that's fine.",2023-07-21 14:25:50
"This is easily one of the most overhyped films I’ve seen in a very long time. 

No CGI/shooting on IMAX cameras was completely unnecessary. 70mm film, sure why not due to this being a timepiece with black and white shots. 

The amount of star power was distracting. I love how Nolan somehow chooses the perfect actor for certain roles. This thing threw every known actor they could find on it just for the sake of it. Oldman as Truman? Really? 

Musical score was very underwhelming. Every time I leave a Nolan film the score sticks to me. Not this time. Too busy trying to decipher what they’re saying to appreciate the music since it’s a damn 3 hour movie with 90% of it being pure dialogue. 

Playing with the timelines doesn’t work for a film like this imo. I shouldn’t have to do homework before I watch a film to fully enjoy it. If you don’t know a brief background on Oppenheimer before watching this, you’re going to be lost. By the time you figure things out, you’re kind of bored by the film. 

The only true positives for me were Cilian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr acting their asses off. I feel Damon has already played this exact same character in another movie. 

Rewatching in hopes to enjoy it more the second time since I’m a massive Nolan fan.",2023-07-27 12:21:01

Unpopular opinion: Oppenheimer was okay and people are afraid to jump off the bandwagon and say how they really feel. It was good but not great. People are raving about how this is the greatest movie of all time and “YOU GOTTA SEE IT IN IMAX!”. I think this movie was way overhyped and people are afraid to go back on it now. 6.5/10,2023-07-26 20:10:35
"I really enjoyed the movie for the most part but I do have a couple of nitpicks 

1. The sex scenes are very ugly and awkward. Maybe that was Nolan’s intention but I certainly didn’t enjoy those scenes. They felt very cheap and unnecessary 

2. The cast is too bloated. Several of the characters are easily forgettable and serve no significant purpose to the story 

3. Would have preferred a tighter runtime. Could’ve been 30-40 minutes shorter

Still a great movie and worth seeing though",2023-07-22 02:51:48

"I am in total awe of this film. The silence during the Trinity detonation and in the theater audience was so defeating I heard was the sound of my heart beating of my chest. What I feel the film did best was captured all the differing viewpoints equally. Both of Oppenheimer and his creation. Even Truman with his brief scene, is made clear to the audience his assessment of Oppenheimer’s moral unease (Truman believed since he ordered the mission, he was the one who should bare the weight).

The cast was without a weak link. Praise will be sung for Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon. But my God, was RDJ’s Senator Straus one utterly contemptible, vindictive bastard. Let this film be shown to anyone who feared RDJ’s craft was dulled by the MCU; Robert Downey, Jr. took no prisoners in this film.

With *Dunkirk* Nolan captured that race against clock anxiety. But with Oppenheimer an albatross has been set over all of our head and the powerless anxiety knowing all that keeps it in place is level heads. But also ironically a devastation so overpowering it can only destroy us all. 

What a truly amazing film.",2023-07-23 04:58:20
"Came out feeling a bit let down and confused. Will need to rewatch again with subtitles. It felt like Nolan is just throwing random shit at you at the beginning then tries to tie everything together as the movie goes on, which could be brilliant, but not a good first-time watching experience. I'm sure I'll appreciate it more after a 2nd viewing (with subtitles)",2023-07-23 08:45:38

EDIT 2: I thought **for sure** the film is going to have an end title card stating that [Oppenheimer’s name has been cleared](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/science/j-robert-oppenheimer-energy-department.html) last year, instead it ends with that shot...

Every show time every day for days is almost completely booked which I can't remember ever seeing for anything. The parking lots at my theater has overflow lots that I've never seen full that are completely packed with cars. What exactly is the draw to the general masses that don't turn out like this for other movies? I'm genuinely confused.",2023-07-23 03:40:59
"Loved the story, felt so engrossing and the moral dilemmas and conflicting notions of a deeply flawed man are so well potrayed by Murphy

However the real show catcher was RDJ's Strauss who I believe can be anyone of us, always having to be sidelined looked at with contempt by men who supposedly have been given some great curse of intelligence, men who have to bear with us normal folks, men who assume that they have a greater say in what is moral and what is not?

However not a great adaptation of a fantastic book, too many parallel storylines going on at the same time, especially in the first half Nolan loves to overdo it with time, it's like he can't accept anything being a linear story clearly here that would have been the better approach",2023-07-23 17:12:56

"I drove hours to the only Analog 70mm IMAX in the PNW, and was not disappointed. 

I was going in wondering how Nolan would incorporate his usual action packed scenes into a story with the peak being the Trinity test. I left with a greater understanding of the emotions felt by all involved, and I'm glad it wasn't a jumpcut action film. 

The Trinity Test was slightly underwhelming visually, and could have benefited from CGI in my opinion. That was easily made up for by the phenomenal audio experience. The composition was amazing and the explosions were earth shattering through the analog system at the theater. 

The only time I was taken out of the movie was in the scene where the lady's skin was being 'melted' off. It looked fake and reminded me of that scene from the office where Dwight puts the mannequins face on his. 

Overall, amazing cinematography and phenomenal audio. The denouement was a little ambiguous, but the actors told the story well. 

8/10 in my opinion. Below Interstellar and Inception, above Tenet, The Prestige and the Dark Night.",2023-07-24 21:22:21
Seeing Robert Downey Jrs scenes in the third act. I wish he would have been cast as Joker. His  performance during the trial was so tense,2023-07-25 03:58:56
"Fantastic movie! Some of the best acting I think I've ever seen in a movie before. Scenes that were supposed to induce tension definitely did through the sudden noise (and lack of noise making me paranoid when the loud bang would come) and expert buildup of said scenes. To not seem like I'm gushing, it took me two watches in order to completely understand the story and especially the trial scenes. Don't feel bad if you don't understand how to connect the dots during your first view. I can see how multiple viewings can be a drawback for people, but I was planning on seeing the movie again anyway. For some reason the format and editing and pacing just all resonated with me in a way that makes me want to watch it several more times. With all the hype of how disturbing it is I was a little disappointed not walking out with any kind of dread that even people I saw the movie with felt. Also I personally don't think IMAX is as big of an upgrade as it's made out to be. It was a good experience for sure, but just going to a good quality theatre was perfectly fine too, which I did for my second watch to compare it to my first IMAX viewing. People would get mad at me and call me a bot for giving it a 10/10 which is how I personally feel about it, so I'll give it an 8-9/10 due to how subjective certain aspects like pacing and format can be for an average viewer besides myself.",2023-07-25 04:56:11

It was an OK movie. My two major complaints are that it focused way too much on the trial and the whole national security/commie spy angle which was a *big distraction* from the actual interesting topics of nuclear energy/weapons/physics/technology/morality. The national security aspect was also quite predictable and boring. The other complaint is that the Trinity test in the movie was very underwhelming and looked nothing like the actual Trinity test (https://youtu.be/wki4hg9Om-k) and did not capture the scale of an atomic explosion.,2023-07-21 02:34:24

"Puritanical filmmaking. So much was made of Nolan’s refusal to use cgi for his explosion that I think he forgot there are other ingenious ways of making films without cgi. I’ve seen bigger and better explosions in the opening credits of the A-team. After that we had to sit through 2 hours of supposedly caring if Oppenheimer got his security clearance renewed!? We’re we supposed to care? Nolan singularly failed to make me care. He tried though, by dumping free YouTube action music over otherwise utterly dull conversations.
And why was imax so important? Nolan doesn’t even seem to care if his shots are lit nicely, so why would I care how big it is?

Anybody thought the bomb scene was super underwhelming?,2023-07-24 05:39:45
"Anyone who is planning to watch this should know what they are getting into. This movie is all about politics and a court case. There is not much science. Los Alamos and the trinity test just take up minor screentime in the movie.

The trailer makes the movie out to be some thriller where they are racing against the Nazi's to make the bomb and it's a life and death situation. They need to build the bomb to end the war, but they don't know if the bomb will destroy the world. Super high stakes. But I kid you not, 80% of the movie revolves around a boardroom and courtcase.

My favourite part of the movie by far was building up Los Alamos/team and the trinity test. Even the trinity test felt abit anti climatic, the blast didn't feel epic. Maybe a bit of CGI would've helped here. Was hoping to see more science of building the bomb, the technical issues they had, the fear they had whether it will work or not, the fear whether they will blow up the whole world etc...

The final hour of the movie was the biggest issue. Imagine going from the high stakes tension of the trinity test to a one hour court case where the only thing on the line was whether Oppenheimer would lose his security clearance. That's right, the entire tension of the last hour was about a security clearance... WTF

Like others have said, the acting was amazing but the movie is letdown by the storytelling

I love Nolan, Interstellar and Inception are top 10 movies of all time for me. But this movie was not good imo",2023-08-02 23:50:14
"Not a Nolan fan, but this was his best film. That being said, I still put it as a 7/10 (maybe 7.5).

The cons:

\- Way too bloated, could easily cut 45-50 minutes out, particularly in the first hour and the last. Too much time with RDJ's character and the whole thing with Oppy possible losing his security clearance.

\- Dialogue was better than most Nolan stuff, but still pretty bad. Too many exposition scenes, too many ""cute"" comments from the characters, and way too many references to earlier lines from the movie.

The meh:

\- The acting for the most part was fine. Nothing terrible, nothing that impressive.

The pros:

\- Cillian Murphy was phenomenal. Absolute perfection start to finish.

\- The middle of the movie was incredibly strong. Firing on all cylinders.

\- They 100% nailed the test scene. Maybe the best 10-15 minutes of Nolan's career.

\- The last 5 minutes or so was perfect.

"It was an alright movie. 7/10. The worst of it was the time jumping you’ll be in one year then all of a sudden you’re 5 years later talking about something else. Then you’re back again. Then the explosion they finally showed was so lackluster and underwhelming if you’ve seen these explosions on old film you can tell what they did was just a gasoline explosion. They shouldn’t have done full practical with this it should have been mostly CGI. They didn’t show anything of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. I’m guessing he was trying to be tasteful but all you get are imagined screams and a ashened body and a white girl with her face peeling.

"I really don't what to make of people that are calling this a 9/10 + or one of the best movie going experiences of their life.

edit : This is not a 9.0 movie. Boring, bad pacing, confusing editing, I frequently didn't like the sound. Not captivating. Too long. Utter disappointment with how the explosions are handled. Hard to understand dialog at points. Completely glossed over the physics and physicists, every time equations are shown, its for less than a second, instead we get multiple sex scenes? Wtf?

After the ""nuclear explosion"" the audience gets blue balled for any more visual displays of the consequences or power of the bomb (asides from a handful of hallucinations). Instead, the movie stretches on for an hour of some literal who wanting to maintain some political position with some petty grudge, and Op losing his security clearance, which it didn't even seem like he even cared about keeping. This is all pertinent to include in a biopic, but i think the only reason this got highlighted is because of RDJ. Too much time going back and forth and back and forth over whether he was a commie.

The reviews are polarizing, and I feel like some people like it by default or they feel they're supposed to appreciate it for being cinematic.",2023-07-24 04:01:22
"It was alright, considering the fact that it was 3 hours, I would have preferred to see less titty and more bomb.

We got like 15 seconds of them making the actual bomb which is the most fascinating thing to me.

They talked way too much about making the bomb and did not show enough of how they made the bomb.

Also the explosion itself was pretty meh. Probably due to it being practical. I know that the real one wasnt that big either but its a movie and that looked like they lit a big puddle of gasoline on fire",2023-08-04 18:27:03
"- Best Nolan film since Inception for me. Absolute masterpiece.

- Casting Pvt. Joker and the reference to Jung made me think of Full Metal Jacket. There is probably no one who encapsulated the duality of man more than Oppenheimer.

I’m trying to understand the conversation between him and Einstein at the end, where Einstein basically says he left his own country, it’s okay for you to do that too. But then Oppy loses his security clearance and… seemingly doesn’t leave the country. What happened to him after? Again, are we meant to feel bad for him? 

Maybe these are the questions Nolan wants us asking, but I’m trying to understand if Strauss was just a self-righteous asshole trying to get back at Oppy, or what? I didn’t expect that feud to consume the whole back third of the movie",2023-07-21 03:02:57

"The best summary I can give is that after it ended and the credits began, there were about 15 seconds in this sold out, 168-person IMAX theater, where no one moved or said *anything.* I don’t think I’ll ever forget that. 

9.8/10",2023-07-21 04:55:30
"Still collecting a lot of thoughts, but basically:

- Cillian Murphy Best Actor Nom
- RDJ Best Supporting Win. This is the best thing I’ve ever seen from him. The whole scene tearing into Oppenheimer for his Martyrdom what electric. 
- David Krumholtz had big Alfred Molina energy. He was awesome. 
- the fucking parade of cameos. So many that it was insane. Gary Oldman as Truman* broke me. 
- The final moments with Oppenheimer and Einstein are the movie. The whole last hour really, but that final bit made this movie one of Nolan’s best
- Once again Nolan let’s down women in his movie, but Blunt and Pugh excelled at what they had. 
- The thematic beauty of the Mutually Assured Destruction of Oppenheimer and Strauss. A Cold War leading to the end of their careers over pure pettiness. 
- See it in 70mm or the biggest avalible screen possible. With the best sound. The Bomb wasn’t even the most intense moment of the movie. The fucking auditorium scene is haunting. 
- The scene with the Secretary of Defense (JAMES REMAR! Another wild cameo) spoke fucking volumes. That whole desperate justification for the nuke when Japan was on the verge of surrender. 
- Florence Pugh. That is all.",2023-07-21 06:55:15
Most memorable movie I've seen in years.,2023-07-21 09:14:24
"Can someone help me know how David Hill (Rami Malek) had the knowledge or credibility to testify about Lewis Strauss’ (RDJ) crusade to tarnish the credibility of Oppenheimer? I feel like I either missed a critical scene or he was just going off of hearsay, since he seemed like an outsider throughout the movie.",2023-07-21 12:01:56

This movie did a really good job of portraying true genius. Just how completely different the way a person like Oppenheimer or Einstein thinks. I felt transported into higher academia and felt the stakes of what they were accomplishing in the classroom as truly as what they were accomplishing in Los Alamos.,2023-07-21 16:22:28

I wonder how people watching this movie who don’t already know a good amount about American history might have felt,2023-07-21 20:06:54
"Straws was portrayed as the one who unjustly defamed Oppenheimer, which I found inappropriate. When Oppenheimer openly expressed his regrets regarding the use of atomic bombs, his words gained global attention and led to criticisms aimed at the USA. In an attempt to prevent further blame on the US government, they tried to silence his views by labeling him as a Soviet sympathizer and later paradoxically awarded him a medal.

Nolan may have been hesitant to reveal the genuine reality in fear of potential repercussions from both the general public and the U.S. government, which the movie could possibly encounter.",2023-07-21 21:38:17
What was the artistic purpose of certain scenes being in black and white?,2023-07-21 23:29:25
"I wish they had touched on Oppenheimer's childhood. I know it wouldn't necessarily have fit easily into the format but I think the context would have been nice. I also wasn't that crazy about the format in general, there was a little too much bouncing around imo and I disliked scenes being repeated. I understand for some of them why it was done but it felt like they recycled about 15 minutes of clips. Overall I liked it but probably won't rewatch. I think it could get repetitive or difficult to follow for people without background knowledge/interest.",2023-07-22 04:54:22
"maybe a top 3 nolan movie score which is saying a lot considering zimmer, arguably the greatest working film composer, has done 7 of them.

overall a really tight movie. 3 hours that felt long and short at the same time. some incredible work from nolan with a few career high shots. absolutely incredible acting from the entire cast with a few standouts (rdj, blunt)

feels to me like it’ll land in the top half of peoples nolan movie rankings but probably in the bottom half of that (with the caveat of “it’s just too hard to pick”.)",2023-07-22 07:47:26
"The practical effects were mostly neat but I think some CGI could have worked better. (Not for the test, just earlier b-roll visuals.)

Great movie. 100x better script than Tenet.",2023-07-22 14:32:15
"I remember Nolan early on in the press tours for this film mention that it's important that Oppenheimer's story be told and it sparked some sort of ""is he being too left wing"" debate on social media. I think that the real magic of this film is what it gives and what it wants to give, but couldn't. It gives entertainment, rich history, a judicious retell of a scientist's life and the existential burden that comes with knowing. What it wants to give, but couldn't, is a movement for people who know the truth. It is so difficult these days to get out there and spark action to the ordinary individual because these days only people in power have the means to. Scientists can tell us over and over and over about the drastic effects of climate change, of nuclear weapons, etc on mankind today and for our children. But at the end of the day, it will all be reduced to political interests. Sucks to see how it has panned out before and how it hasn't changed much today.",2023-07-22 18:54:16

"This turned out to be much more my type of movie than I initially thought it would be. I really enjoyed it, and the last act was some of the most enjoyable cinema I’ve seen in a bit. 

But I felt like there were two different amazing films (or films I’d enjoy more) in here, and the film as it stands never hit the heights either could have. 

I also felt like the film was oddly shallow given the subject matter? The bomb took up a lot of space in the movie but I never felt like the movie sustainedly and seriously grappled with it - even when the movie was telling me that’s what it was doing. 

It was still great and everyone was giving a stellar performance.",2023-07-22 21:33:49

"I generally really liked it. It was like reverse Tenet? Like Tenet was so all over the place but still so enjoyable for what it was whereas Oppenheimer was pretty straight forward and vanilla for Nolan. 

My only legit criticisms (because everything else is either good to great): 

1. They could have easily shaved off 20 minutes and it would have been fine. 

2. I would have liked to see Nolan get a little more creative on his story structure. 

3. Some of the procedural stuff could have been edited to be a little more clear.

4. I would have liked a little more explanation of certain elements that weren't obvious like the HUGE difference between Hydrogen bombs vs the smaller yield fission bombs. Not knowing a detail like that can cause folks to not quite grasp his adamant opposition to them.

Everything else was just quite lovely. Fantastic performance by Murphy and really the entire cast was good. Good camerawork, great sound design, good music, well written dialog, a good message and meditation on a heavy existential topic without getting overly preachy. 

8.8/10. I don't want to rush off and see it again right now like I did with Interstellar or Dark Knight but it was good. On par with other solid Nolan flicks",2023-07-24 02:31:19
"I thought Oppenheimer presented an interesting take on the ""great man"" archetype thats been ubiquitous throughout all of American film history. Think Citizen Kane, The Godfather or There Will Be Blood. The more the men in those films thirst for and accumulate power and wealth, the more corrupt and depraved and robotic they become. Oppenheimer reaches the pinnacle of his field, but instead of pushing for never ending growth in it, pushing for the creation he helped steward into reality to more readily available for warfare. To be pushing for more powerful atomic bombs, or to his later misfortune, a hydrogen bomb. Instead, he speaks his conscience, whatever it may have been at that moment and of his guilt. In a sense, Nolan has taken a story about the 20th century and made it about the 21st- about a man without strong convictions or beliefs, who pushes the technological envelope to its breaking point and is forced to deal with the fall out by attempting to mitigate the completely foreseeable consequences of his creation after its too late. Essentially, Oppenheimer does the opposite of the characters in those other movies but the end result is the same. He has won, but at what cost?

I thought it was very engaging, quickest three hours I can remember in a theatre. What is with the music in these films though? So loud. The musical cues in All Quiet last year almost ruined the movie for me, and that was at home.",2023-07-24 03:59:24
"Can anyone explain the scene when Oppenheimer went to meet 3(or 2?) scientists in an underground bunker? I think Rami Malek was one of them but I couldn't really catch what was going on that time.

Edit: Thanks for the responses guys.",2023-07-24 11:30:29
"Really enjoyed the seamless transitions between people talking in different time periods and places. OPPO would be talking to one physicist then the camera would flip back and he would be discussing with someone else. Especially done well in the board room interview scenes. 

The one part I didn't like, but knew was coming, was when things started to get real tense in the board room and it climaxed to something like the bomb going off. That felt pretty cliche, and at that point the movie was already long. But overall one of the best biopics Ive ever seen.",2023-07-24 13:09:28

"SCREWUP? : I’m almost positive that in one of the scenes where large numbers of those working on the bomb gathered to meet or celebrate there was a basketball backboard. No doubt it was part of the recreation available in Los Alamos. But, the backboard was not the rectangular design, but the fan version. Having played since a kid in the 1950s til the present, the fan was not something that existed in the 1940s. Obviously, if I am right, there is reason to question everything else, e.g., did Oppenheimer exist; was there a bomb? :)",2023-07-25 15:10:15

"Wow it was amazing! Fortunately have the Metreon IMAX in San Francisco. Had a nice seat at the center.

Immediately wanted to rewatch the whole movie Hoping for another viewing in IMAX.

Minor Complaints 
The final act kinda drags a bit. Anyone and everyone having to put in their statements.

Do wish Nolan would have been more explicit in the brutality. When they are showing the slides of the aftermath. 

Concerning Actors
Rami Malik pursing? his lips again, I loved him in Mr Robot and Night at the Museum. Saw highlights and his mouth seems relax. It started with Bohemian Rhapsody, did enjoy the movie..

But ever since BR, he is like always doing ""Blue Steel, Le Tigre, Magnum"" mouth. Did BR screw up his mouth or does he have a condition?

On some level I like Casey Affleck, but I can never buy him as a tough as nails dude. If anything I think of him as the weasely brother from Oceans Trilogy.",2023-07-26 03:55:31
"Was a little discouraged going in to see this tonight. A lot of viewers said it was too long, and too much dialogue. I really enjoyed it the acting was phenomenal great cinematography and score.

"Enjoyed it a lot. A whole bunch of incredible performances. Trinity test and the scene in the gym where amazing, but what will stay on my mind the most, apart from the ending, was how they were discussing targets for the bomb, with absolutely no regards for how horrible a crime they we're committing.  
  Really enjoyed the portrayal of Oppenheimer as an absolute genius, but also a spineless coward that ultimately never believes in anything with conviction.  
  The Pugh ""I am become death"" sex scene is, as discussed in this thread, extremely cringy, but I do like it from the angle that Pugh's life is the first one Oppenheimer destroys, he really has become death  in that moment.",2023-07-27 22:46:00

"Note, I'm not a film critic or anything. I have no idea what I'm talking about, these are just my feelings from seeing the movie, and movie expert people may be able to correct me on some stuff.

I was pretty frustrated. I love Nolan, and some of his work probably isn't as good (Dunkirk, Tenet), but whenever I think of Nolan, I think of Interstellar. Or at least, I went into this movie hoping to be floored, the way that Interstellar floored me. I loved that movie so much, that I bought The Science of Interstellar, and read the whole thing in a day or two (something like that anyway). Point being, Nolan made me so immersed in the Interstellar universe, that I couldn't get enough of the details involved in how it was made up.

I guess I was hoping for something similar here: Who was Oppenheimer? What did his story look like? What were his motivations? What did his work on the bomb look like? 

And some of this was addressed, I think (again, I'm just a guy who doesn't know much about the subject as a whole):  Oppenheimer is a guy from America, I think? I don't know. He loves the wild west, I guess? He's level-headed, and attempts to do the right thing, like when he donated to those suffering in Spain. He was the director of the Manhattan project, I think.

Some things really frustrated me. I almost left the theater after about an hour or so. 

1. His first love interest was the most dull woman. She had a monotone ""I always love wiggle room"" line, and then they started having sex. What? Why is Oppenheimer interested in this woman at all? Then, she starts having all types of mental issues, and rejects his flowers, but he apparently is so infatuated with her that he ignores how ridiculously rude she is to him. She throws his flowers away repeatedly, but apparently that's not that big of a deal
2. The woman who ends up being his wife holds his hand at a party once, and is apparently a giant drunk, who can't take care of their son. At one point, he comes home, the baby is howling like a madman, and she's wasted, and he just gives her a hug, and asks how things are going. What the fuck?
3. Robert Downey Junior, who I also really like, was this sort of silly, fun dude that was eager, witty, and sort of slightly jumpy, which is the opposite of what he probably should have been. He's supposed to be a high level, career-man type of politician, and if you've ever seen interviews with those types of guys, they're often logical, and frankly, somewhat boring. Instead, you get this silly goofy Robert Downey Junior, who literally skips down the steps to go meet Oppenheimer. A high level political schemer like his character would fucking never do that. Those guys are serious, they walk slow, and they're intentional in every move that they make. Nolan tried to show this off in the character later, when he schemed against Oppenheimer, but it was already a bit spoiled at that point
4. Way too many characters dude. I'm sorry, but I tried to follow all of the plots of the movie, and even that was too much, but the number of people who I had to remember was too much, and I fucking gave up. Who was the guy who interviewed him, and sat across the desk from him, while the psychopath American military guy sat next to him? Who was Lobolowitz, or whatever his name was? Who was the big fat guy? I got so lost.

Also, I have no idea why he wanted his brother to come to the base. He kept asking for this, and even I was like dude compartmentalization. Matt Damon is right.

Oh, and the dialog was fucking horrendous. Every few scenes someone would come to Oppenheimer and go ""Oh my God Oppenheimer you have to do something, you're God's gift to mankind, the smartest guy in the universe."" No one talks like that to their friends or colleagues, even if they respect them. I really wanted to like this movie, hopefully Christopher Nolan will put out a good one in the future.",2023-07-22 00:58:21
"The film was far too long. They could have cut all of the romance and that would have saved at least 20 minutes for example. It felt very self indulgent. 

I feel the film didn't know what story it wanted to tell: scientific discovery or political thriller. I feel the payoff in the third act was messy and relied far too heavily on the audience recalling every scientist and their actions and motives. The black and white scenes were a failed idea. 

The score whilst fitting  and functional didn't leave me wanting to rush home and boot up Spotify like other Nolan films. 

The acting was excellent.",2023-07-22 01:23:04
"I looked forward to Oppenheimer, having had a lot of physics in college. 

Found it to be... OK, but not entirely up to its hype

2)	It should not have required $100 million to tell that story  
3)	It wasn’t a big enough piece of cinema for IMAX. TV would have been fine.  
4)	In the 3 hours, they might have developed the other scientists more  
5)	The Trinity test didn’t look like an atomic explosion  
6)	FWIW, Gary Oldman played a great Truman. It was a small part, but it was enjoyable",2023-07-22 03:23:39
"To me it felt like 3 hours of exposition. The scenes felt carelessly placed together, non stop talking and no real emotional depth.

It was boring. I really wanted to see more regarding the nuclear side of things, not actors dropping ""quantum physics"" in dialogue every now and again. The bomb test was underwhelming too.

It just felt like nolan threw all these scenes together. I was really trying to enjoy it. I didn't want to see a (really underwhelming) court room drama, honestly why focus on something with stakes so low?

I felt no connection to any of the characters.

Good to see Josh Hartnett back at it again though.",2023-07-22 08:17:19
"Poorly written and poorly edited. 

The movie should've focused only on the Manhattan Project, not his early life and post-war political struggles. It's just spread too thin. 

It also moved way too fast. Every scene is ""sprinting"" as fast as possible, and so none of the scenes had air to breathe and take on life.",2023-07-23 13:14:59

"I love Nolan but this was such a disappointment for me. It was impeccably acted by a brilliant cast but I can’t say I’d ever want to sit through it again, it was way too long and dwelt on the parts I had least interest in. In the context of the whole story, was his security clearance really that important to spent an hour on? I actually found the ‘courtroom’ scenes very tedious and repetitive by the end. 

It’s also the first time I’ve bought into the Nolan ‘must see at IMAX’ hype and thought afterwards it wasn’t worth it. If anything it set my expectation of a spectacular movie (at least in part ) when actually I’d have been better off watching it in a smaller indie theatre like I did for stuff like The Social Network.",2023-07-25 23:47:10
Reading through the comments and it's *astounding* how prudish and anti-sex so many people are. My god some people need to grow up.,2023-07-29 23:55:36
"I just watched it and I cannot say that I enjoyed it. I think 3 hours is simply too long. The movie could have been best served with an edit as I felt some scenes dragged on, the plot in parts was too convoluted, and the three parts of the movie were just not cohesive enough to justify it being 3 hours long. Is Nolan untouchable that nobody wants to dare edit the movies to a more bearable 1.5-2 hours?

The scene everyone was looking forward to - the nuclear blast - was, as others have pointed out, underwhelming, probably deliberately so. But in a movie like this, I think that the nuclear bomb should have packed more of a punch to show the terrifying and frightening world-changing majesty of it. The silence was a wise choice, but the bomb itself just looked small, like any other bomb, really. It made me question what all the hype about it being IMAX-suitable was all about. The only scene that really packed the necessary punch was the last 10 seconds of the movie, sadly. 

I think the movie bounces around from scene to scene so frenetically that it's easy to get lost (as with Tenet, an even worse film, though fortunately it was easier to hear what was being spoken in Oppenheimer). 

I don't think the movie did enough to really make us care enough Strauss, nor did I think it really made a lot of sense to dedicate so much time to this man's ego. It felt like a little random bit of isolated drama, though I will say that Robert Downey Junior can act, as too can all the other actors. 

Einstein's scenes were just all accidentally funny. He reminded me of some random bumbling villager in a video game who appears in random scenes in the same city to offer a bit of thinky-thinky wisdom to the main character. 

I note the scarcity of women in Nolan movies is always obvious - they're just supportive two dimensional characters who act as shadows of a man, or in this case, just let their kids cry relentlessly every time they appear in a scene. The lack of women is pretty ironic given Oppenheimer's competition is the feminist Barbie movie.

I will say that I am at least now more curious to read about Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, American Prometheus, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, etc.",2023-07-30 15:03:48
"The pacing was terrible. I've never been to a movie before that felt this long and fast at the same time. The first two acts were so crammed together it left no room to breathe. Dialogue after dialogue after dialogue. No explanations on the maths, the figuring,  anything... It just happens. Pacing was a little better in the third act but by then I was growing antsy due to the length of the film. Overall I'd still rate it a 7.5/10.",2023-07-31 21:49:36
"The cinematography was incredible. But that's all I enjoyed from the film.

The pacing was too fast. So many scenes went by with a flash with normal conversations having dramatic zoom ins. It was hard to grasp what was going on when we keep jumping scene to scene, time skip to time skip. The best moments in the film was when we actually stuck around a bit and focused on something for more than 5 minutes. Some characters purely existed for character development.

Another issue was the audio. It was so loud that it was hard to discern what the characters were saying at times.

It felt like a botched amateur documentary. Interstellar was Nolan's last good movie. What a shame.",2023-08-06 18:07:28
"I‘m really getting annoyed how Nolan occupies great ideas and then produces pretty mediocre stuff from them, except for some aspects of visual aesthetics",2023-08-07 09:34:54
" I was looking forward to Oppenheimer but I found some aspects of the film's execution disappointing. I am sorry if I got anything wrong, I plan on watching the movie again (with subtitles this time, my first language is not English, so that along with the background music score made it so hard for me to understand the dialogue in the theatre).

1. **Visual styling:** I'm confused by Nolan's choice to present the future in black and white while showing the past in color. Whatever it was meant to symbolize was lost on me. However, I appreciated how he juxtaposed Oppenheimer's and Strauss's trials, allowing their stories to run parallel.
2. **Background music:** This was so loud that I couldn't pay attention to any of the dialogues. This is a Nolan thing, but watching and parsing a movie should not be this hard and it affected my ability to fully engage in this movie. 90% of the movie had a background score, and most of the time it was so loud I had to really focus on the lips to try to gather what was being spoken.
3. **Characters development (mainly in the first half):** I actually didn't fully understand a lot of the aesthetic storytelling choices Nolan made while jumping time in the first half of the movie. I saw ColdFusion's video about Oppenheimer before watching the movie and he is such a nuanced and interesting and gray character, but I felt that Nolan didn't really bring that out effectively while diving into his problematic past making it hard for me to connect. For instance, Arcane is one of my favorite shows that writes gray characters and morally gray choices so well and effectively. There were so many characters, and without a lot of historical context, I kept forgetting them and had to keep a wiki page open to follow along. As a good storyteller, I feel that the intensity and depth of emotions can be conveyed without having the background knowledge about each character and their relationship with Oppenheimer.
4. **Portrayal of women:** I noticed that the film briefly touched on Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's politics, but it didn't delve into this aspect. I didn't particularly like the way she was portrayed, I terribly disliked the scene where the two of them have sex as the cheating incident is recounted in the room of the hearing as a way of expressing how haunted Kitty felt by the incident. I didn't feel like it was done tastefully.
5. **The scene of the bomb:** This was really good. However, maybe this is just me being nit-picky, I don't understand why Nolan didn't want to use CGI for this, if it could have been made better. And I think it's hard for me to understand how this bomb scene could have blown up the budget of the movie. (Here is an interesting video where a dude tries to recreate the effects from the movie: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2FqU2f6DRc&t=62s))

The film's execution in the first half left me somewhat disconnected from the characters and their complexities. I did find the second half much more gripping. Oppenheimer's haunting expressed by the foot-stamping in the room he comes to give his speech after the bomb; the scene of the bomb itself; his future vision, him telling Einstein ""I believe we did"" in response to setting off a chain reaction; Kitty telling him that he does not get to sin and then expect others to feel sorry for him; Kitty's response to the board in the trial room, all of these were amazing. I think it's just since the first half fell flat, I couldn't feel the intensity of being swept away by a character so morally grey and haunted and tortured as Oppenheimer. I plan to watch the movie again, and would appreciate any comments that can help me maybe understand and appreciate this movie better.",2023-08-15 23:14:10
I thoroughly disliked the film. The plot doesn’t know what to do next and the emotional climax occurs 40 minutes before the movie decides to end.,2023-07-22 02:15:17
"Was anyone else incredibly bored? Way too long.

Had very high expectations",2023-07-22 21:26:40
"As much as everyones dunking on people who didn't like this movie and saying they expected some insane action marvel movie, this to me felt like one big marvel-esque biopic \*queue epic jfk namedrop\*

The cast, I could not take seriously. They usually get some big framed entrance with the camera in their face taking up the whole screen only to be a minor character. The reason why they get all these entrances is because it's a cameo for actor, not the character which completely takes out of the movie. (seriously, there's no way you guys saw Rami Malek read his script for 10 minutes and thought ""WOW HIS CHARACTER THAT I TOTALLY KNEW THE NAME OF BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER!"")

Matt Damon is particularly egregious in this movie as he does not fit whatsoever and is the least convincing for his part in the movie. On the other hand, Emily Blunt and RDJ I felt were the most convincing ignoring some of the issues with Blunt's character.

A lot of the dialogue for kitty in the last hour felt like she was only there to be a vehicle for the script to baby the viewers so they can explain to the audience how complicated and nuanced Oppenheimer is. Every fucking issue or motivation a character has, every fucking bit of nuance a character possesses is always directly spelled out and explained to you by some character's dialogue.

Also with the dialogue.. Nolan has this thing where he wants to do a lot of ""iconic"" lines that are meant to feel smart and cool but the thing is, he does this with every other fucking line of dialogue to the point where every conversation feels very unrealistic, manufactured and corny and none of the \*cool sentences\* hit as hard. He has the very same issue with the editing and score.

The editing and score in this movie is so adhd it's incredible. The first 2 hours is legit edited like a trailer and not a single one of the ""iconic"" scenes were able to get a sense of tension or emotion out me because none of them had an ounce of room to breathe or sit with the audience.

He wants to blast the music every fucking scene to make it grandiose or make me feel something, but instead, it hinders entire movie because his over-scoring fails to make a single scene stand out. He is not thoughtfully selecting where to put the music, he's just putting it in for the sake of putting it in. Due of this, the emphasis and the enhancement scores are supposed to give is lost because Nolan is afraid I will lose interests if he doesn't have some orchestral music playing during every little moment. Same goes with the mindless editing which I guess was a poor attempt to make things feel frantic. The movie does this bullshit where they will cut like 5 times in 3 seconds for no fucking reason. The movie refuses to let me sit with anything or digest SOMETHING! The thing where Oppenheimer is talking about something and it will cut quickly onto whatever he's talking about was cute but became quickly overused and almost a parody of itself. Basically moral of the story, Less is more.

The cinematography was meh as a lot of it consisted of close ups of some actor's face taking up the screen. Which isn't bad! if done purposefully. But again, this is a 3 hour long movie and this is like every fucking shot. To me it just felt like ""HEY LOOK AT THIS ACTOR, LOOK! DO YOU SEE ALL THE STAR POWER WE HAVE? COME LOOK AT THIS ACTOR!""

Because of the bad dialogue, the bad editing, the bad score usage and the meh cinematography. Every big/important scene flopped. I think the last \*Oppenheimer imagining the room blowing up\* scene where he was being questioned was the most successful scene in the movie in terms of setting out to achieve its goal, All the other ""big"" scenes in the movie failed to hit its mark.

I know a lot of people were complaining about the trinity bomb scene, and yes lets please all admit, that was pretty underwhelming. If you want to see a good version of that, I direct you to the Twin Peaks Trinity atomic bomb scene easily found on youtube.

The last hour of the movie was the better part, but there was a lot of telling instead of showing with the characters explaining Oppenheimer's (as well as themselves) motivations and feelings in great detail because Nolan can't write dialogue to save his life. Due to this it got pretty annoyingly pro-Oppenheimer preachy with the characters (not the movie itself). It feels like again, the script was treating the audience like babies and trying to get some marvelized superhero come back moment for Oppie.

Final thoughts: This isn't a bad movie, just felt very amateurish with a lot of it's creative decisions. I don't find this movie boring, it would have been ridiculous to end the movie at just just the bomb scene and cut out the last hour. The time jump idea was okay but poorly executed.

Also random thing. One scene that was kinda annoying is when Kitty is doing her testimony thing and she's like ""16, no 17, actually sorry 18"" or whatever, the way they had her read her lines, that one specifically was like Disney channel levels of babying the audience. If I was in that room, I would instantly assume she's lying with her playing it up to that extreme degree. It felt like she was just reading her lines that way so the audience knows that yes she knows what she's doing and she's being strategic about it but to the detriment of the believability and seriousness of that scene where i'm just like ""there's no way those guys in the room are not thinking she's clearly lying"".

"I assume I'll catch shit for this but honestly it's a 6.5/10. It really didn't need to be 3 hours. There are some really cool scenes (bomb drop, his speech where he saw the crowd as the bombed victims, the Einstein award, etc.) But it suffered from pacing issues.

"Pasting my comment from the other thread:
***

Went to an early IMAX screening last night.


It's a great film without a doubt with so much going for it, but I really hated how it was edited: constant cutting back and forth every time someone talks essentially, some of the cutaways lasting less than a second sometimes where characters don't even say a word, just random inserts, all shot in the most bland way ever.


Maybe this was intentional so it would give the film ""energy"" as to not make the audience feel like the 3h were a slog, but man, it got to a point where the editing for me was really hurting some performances, which was sad to see.


I'm also curious to know whether other people noticed a huge amount of shots that appeared to be out of focus. I think this was a problem with the film and not my theater's projector, but who knows.


It's a solid film that could've been even better had they taken greater care with some aspects of the filmmaking.",2023-07-21 17:30:08
"I thought it was good overall but it did feel like two movies steamrolled into one. On one hand, you have the construction of the atomic bomb and the fallout, on the other, you have the Strauss vs Oppenheimer plotline. Overall I felt it was a bit confusing with how they were mixed. The direction and acting were top notch though.",2023-07-21 18:35:46
Absolutely fantastic film. The final scene is absolutely chilling given current events.,2023-07-22 18:42:43
I like how Nolan doesn't do text on screen instead relying on the audience to pay attention. You don't get Oppenheimer going to London then giant text saying London. Or text saying what year or date it is. That's not a bad approach to have those but Oppenheimer demonstrates how you can do it effectively without it as well. And I just think a lot of filmmakers use it as a crutch or maybe a studio exec gives the order to have them just because they don't have faith in the audience.,2023-07-22 19:02:58
"An A-grade film for sure and the best movie of the year so far. It felt like the culmination of Nolan's entire career.

The movie definitely has its faults--notably some hammy acting here and there and a gratuitous cameo or two--but it kept me enthralled from start to finish. The Trinity test sequence followed almost immediately by Oppenheimer's speech in the gym was arguably filmmaking at its finest.

Oppenheimer is definitely going to be remembered as a 21st century classic. I hope its success inspires Hollywood to focus more on making intelligent films for adults.",2023-07-22 20:42:58
"Incredible. Felt shorter than 3 hours. The different time periods were weaved together very well, I was never confused about when we were. The age makeup was great, too. Cried at least twice. Going to be thinking about this one for a while. Oh and two hours after it finished we went to see Barbie. So now I need to reflect on my life while suffering existential dread",2023-07-23 19:35:25
"Unpopular opinion: I thought Matt Damon disappeared into his role and really enjoyed him, and I thought the opposite for RDJ.

Although maybe it was because 2hr30 into the movie the teens next to me loudly whispered ""YO, that's Iron Man bro"" haha",2023-07-24 04:54:18
"The constant background music was bugging me in the beginning, but it allowed for a grand silence during the explosion that had me in awe.. not sure if that was on purpose. 

Let’s give the goofiest cast member the role of detonating the first atomic bomb in history I’m sure that’s a great idea 

Also not sure if RDJ did a poor job or the role of Strauss was overemphasized 

Idk mixed feelings about this one.. enjoyed my time at the theatre though",2023-07-27 23:49:44
Did not expect a movie about Oppenheimer to feel so similar to Oliver Stone's masterpiece JFK. Making people having conversations in a room for 3 hours as propulsive and masterful as this is God level filmmaking. Easily Nolan's best,2023-07-29 00:42:20

"Awesome movie. I couldn’t care for Dunkirk and Tenet but this one just blew me away. Sound in 70mm was crazy, the people next to me were full on covering their ears during the trinity test lol. 

My only criticisms would probably be the Florence Pugh scenes, I didn’t think it added much substance and wasn’t executed well. Could have been cut without losing much significance in the plot. I also couldn’t hear some of the critical dialogue due to the music, idk what Oppenheimer said in the final scene with Einstein. 

The shitty Imax seats also made this movie seem much longer than it was.",2023-07-31 07:21:30
"Apparently a lot of people claim they walked out of this movie. I’m not sure I really believe all those claims. Like I get not liking the movie, but, hating it to the point of walking out? Seriously? Maybe I’m just different, but I’m trying to figure out how awful a movie has to be for me to do that. And if a movie is truly that awful, I probably in a million years wouldn’t be interested in seeing it in the first place. Even if I don’t end up liking it really, I find some value in it.",2023-08-06 19:08:25
"3/5 to me. Performances and editing were fantastic but the cinematography, screenplay and actual bomb scene fell flat for me. The goosebumps I got during the gym speech and last sentiment didn't feel earned thru the premise so much as forced through the score. I'm glad I saw in in theaters but I'll probably never watch it again.",2023-08-25 22:28:20
"While not terrible, I was pretty disappointed. I really wanted to like it - I have a background in theoretical math and history of math and science, and was really compelled by the subject matter. But damn, despite the great cast on this movie, it was completely soulless. I know all of the scenes with women were based on real life, but there was no emotion in them and I would have preferred they be cut out of the movie. I did not buy him as a womanizer. In fact, all of Oppenheimer's relationships felt empty. There was no chemistry between Cillian and anyone, except Matt Damon at times, and Albert Einstein. When Cillian played Oppenheimer in moments where he was alone (e.g., when people were cheering or stomping and he was fading out), he killed it, but otherwise, he overdid the stiffness to the point where every interaction felt dry. Thank god for the RDJ scenes, they weren't even amazing but at least they were a change of pace.

This movie felt a lot like Nolan read ""show, don't tell"" and got scared he wasn't showing enough. Every demonstrative scene of something (e.g., Cillian and Josh Hartnett disagreeing about unionization) felt forced, the result of which being I never actually felt like they were ever friends. While I liked the emphasis on the fact that this was a large group effort, they threw so many names out there all the time just to have them. I also fucking hated the style. All of the Oppenheimer scenes felt so goddamn rushed. I get what Nolan was trying to do, and I'm glad it worked for most people, but for me, I wish instead of trying to add in all this tension and stress at the beginning, it let it slowly build up. The movie did find its feet in the last 80 minutes, but by that time, I was super worn out and annoyed, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have otherwise. Ultimately, these issues wormed their way into the biggest issue: I didn't even care about the movie's message, because it was sort of flung at me. Don't get me wrong, I felt a lot of tension and suspense watching the movie, but it did not get me to think critically, nor did I feel like it actually had as much to say as it thought it did. It was classic ""I think I'm so smart"" stuff. Teller challenging Oppenheimer to share his beliefs was such an important part of the movie and it just fell completely flat, like the rest of their relationship (which again, I was supposed to care about)? So by the time Oppenheimer started shouting in the break room, I didn't really care about anything but the (admittedly fun) adrenaline rush the soundscape was taking me on.

Now that that's out of the way, here are some things I liked: the sound effects were incredible. The detonation sequence in New Mexico was also incredible, as were the scenes with Cillian melting down in crowded spaces. I really liked the Einstein scenes, maybe because the movie actually chilled the fuck out. Was probably worth seeing, but sooooo long and such a slog to get to the good stuff that I'll gladly never watch it again.

TL;DR: this movie was tryhard and rode on some really fun and excellent soundscaping. It is different, and creative, but not in a way that actually made the film better, in fact, the experimentation with the storytelling contributed to why it sucked.

Edit: grammar.",2023-08-01 04:52:54
"I never thought I'd consider leaving a Nolan movie, thrice. 

This was a movie about senate politics, security clearances and love affairs, for three hours. And most every god forsaken dialogue was quick cut between three or more serious men filling in each other's sentences for the entire dialogue like they all split the script's lines between them.

Everything builds up to the test in the middle of the movie and it's just a poof in the desert. There is so much cinematography to explore in order to show what Oppenheimer felt, but this was just him starring at an underwhelming light show. The barely surviving silent black and white original film capture from the Trinity test makes it look more massive and mortifying than this did.

Cillian Murphy is miscast, not as Robert Oppenheimer, but as this Oppenheimer. The real Oppenheimer rolled on the floor in anxiety, this Oppenheimer mostly gulps. He was known to be a dramatic and eccentric individual, this Oppenheimer is timid and bland. I'd love to see Cilian Murphy get to do Oppenheimer right.

Do I even have to mention Oppie saying his ""Now I am become death"" during. the. sex. scene. The _sex_ scene.

I wish I had seen Barbie twice.",2023-07-28 00:47:23
"I found the movie to be way too long and felt like an absolute drag. There was way too much skipping all over the place from scene to scene and the dialogue felt like it was rambling too much. There just seemed to be so much story this movie wanted to tell and so many characters they wanted to introduce that I think this would have been much better suited to being a mini series rather than a 3 hour movie that felt like it was never going to end. I also wasn’t a fan of the constant time skipping, at least if it was a mini series it could have been paced out better and able to tell all of the story. And the actual bomb scene did not have the impact I was expecting or hoping for.

I’m glad to see so many people enjoyed this film but for me I was just glad it was finally over with.",2023-07-21 16:32:05
"This movie felt like a masturbatory slog. It really comes across like Nolan thinks he's an absolute genius, and it got in the way of a making a better movie.

The constant changes in aspect ratio were distracting. Some of the prosthetic makeup was distractingly bad. The explosion was... unimpressive. I saw it on IMAX and I think audiences are confusing loud with good. Great example of how some well restrained, but carefully executed CGI can have a big impact. By the time the bomb exploded my partner and I were ready for the movie to be over, but then it felt like they pulled the sheet off and were like ""Surprise! You've been watching a much more boring movie this whole time!"" and it slogged along for another miserable hour. A guy a couple rows back from where I was sitting let out a groaning ""Jesus, finally!"" when the credits rolled.

Most of the performances themselves were top tier though, and the photography was somewhere between beautiful and consistently competent. The score was good, but at no point did it seem like it knew what act of the movie it was in. I might would have thought it was the best movie I'd ever seen had it come out when I was 17.

I don't think it came anywhere near meeting the hype it's been getting. IMAX was unnecessary and I suspect that I might have left with a generally more positive impression of the film had I watched it at home where I could actually sit comfortably, stop to go to the bathroom and get snacks periodically, and sporadically engage in commentary before getting back into it.",2023-07-25 04:00:44
"I just saw the movie and I am baffled that it gets so much praise. The best way to put it why it was bad, is because you can’t have dramatic scenes if every scene is dramatic. We get 3 hours of overly dramatic music and dialog, we only got 30 seconds of quiet time before the explosion. The way the story was presented might have been interesting if it was more coherent. We didn’t really get to know the main character or his moral dilemma. In some parts it is personal drama story then it shifts to political drama. Not that you can’t have both but not in this way. Also what was the deal with his first communist love affair. This could have been very interesting to see something personal to him and also to see how America viewed communism. Instead we got a sex scene where the girl got of from him reading some ancient script and then she kills herself because he is no longer available to her and he is deeply scared but for like 2 minutes before completely forgetting about it. They could have saved at least 20 minutes not including her at all and we would not have missed much. Sorry guys but the movie is far from what it should have been.",2023-07-26 22:08:37
"This movie was a 6 or 7. Way too long, way too self-important. And the horrific, droning musical score was awful and made hearing the dialogue next to impossible. Sorry, the non-linear script was the wrong approach here. Total needless distraction. This movie should have been directed by someone like a Clint Eastwood. Somebody who understands character development. This movie was a cold arthouse project and while technically impressive, a bore and a slog.

I wasn’t even that impressed with Cillian who showcased a very narrow range. And please with the needless sex scenes that served no purpose whatsoever and were just awkward drop-ins.",2023-07-27 07:54:12

Masterpiece btw. Jennifer/Ludwig/Hoyte are all bringing their absolute best and it really sets this movie over the top for me.

Emily Blunt was literally a placeholder until one great scene at the end. Maybe I didn't get this one, but atleast his other movies ""flowed"" better, if that makes sense. Even Tenet. The actors were great, the Bhagvad Gita sex scene just felt overindulgent. The explosion and the sound design for this movie was also excellent. The bomb scene was perfect, I never doubted that at all. The absolute best scene for me was the speech he gives after the bombs have been dropped. Maybe I'll warm up to this on a rewatch.",2023-07-23 12:08:35
Honestly no way to sugar coat it. This is a really bad movie. It isn’t interesting at all. It’s dialogue in a room for 90% of the 3 hours. Extremely underwhelming. 3/10 only for good music and acting.,2023-07-21 07:13:51

"So the whole movie was about Lewis having a petty grudge against Oppenheimer, the stakes being a cabinet position and a security clearance. Like, that's the actual climax of the movie, that Oppenheimer looses his clearance and Lewis looses a senate vote.
It's structured in a way that it only comes together how petty the whole thing is at the very end.
They spend more time on communists and unionization than the bomb, but even that is boring because nobody has anything interesting to say about it, we don't know why Oppenheimer is a fellow traveler, it's just repeated as a circumstance again and again. So never ""about communism"" it's just ""about people being communists"". 

And sure the movie is ""Oppenheimer"" not ""Nuclear Weapons"", but this movie is only concerned with nukes is to get trailer footage, and insofar it's related to the investigation. It's ridiculous how they hyped it up as a movie that make you terrified of MAD. But they almost purposefully don't show anything that doesn't directly effect Oppenheimer.

I kinda expected to see how recklessly the feds tried to figure out nuclear strategy, see shit like Operation Crossroads, or at least Hiroshima. They even have a scene where someone is showing pictures of Hiroshima burn marks, and we are purposefully facing away from the pictures, like he is taunting us.
And they tried to flip it positively with the ""no CGI"" shit, of course you don't have to when you only show Trinity. Hell, real Operation Crossroads footage is more impressive than what they show in the film.

This movie is just not on that scale, it's about arguing about who is a communist in a small room for three hours.",2023-07-22 15:31:56

I don't think there is a scene in the entire movie that lasts more than 2 mins(Ill even say 1) before moving onto another. Way, way to fast. Also, the scene with Florence Pugh, was so out of pocket it felt like a fan made edit and did not fit the movies tone whatsoever.

"As a physics degree holder, boy am I sad with how much I hated this movie. Really was looking forward to it and expected to love it.

In the first 30m I was giddy with the parade 
of all the historical physics juggernauts, feeling like the movie was gearing up for something really special only to be confused and disoriented by an unnecessarily convoluted timeline and equally unintelligible dialog that is punctuated by a build up to an almost comically impotent bomb blast that unquestionably should have been CGI.

The majority of this movie being a confusing board room hearing makes it feel like the most pointless IMAX movie ever made.

I did not pick up on the B&W shots indicating the timeline so maybe that makes me the dumbass. Idk. I really had no clue what was going on for a huge majority of the movie.

By the third act I kinda felt like I started to get what was going on but was already so worn out I was just waiting to be set free by the credits. 

Loved the last scene with Albert.

I am hoping I will like this one better when it streams with subtitles but I feel pretty bummed about it on first watch.",2023-08-03 05:00:02
"The entirety of RDJ's confirmation hearing should have been cut or reduced to a textual epilogue at the end of the movie. Absolutely unnecessary to show all that.

Also, there was really no need for so many time jumps - back and forth, back and forth. It was dizzying at times. I know it's kinda Nolan's shtick to fuck around with flashbacks and flashforwards, but it really felt it was pointless here. Could have just told the same story mostly chronologically, and probably shaved an hour from the runtime in the process. 

And why the fuck did Einstein react that way to Oppenheimer's words at the end? It really wasn't that deep, as if Einstein didn't already know what having such a power unleashed could mean for the world.",2023-07-25 03:28:22
"Shallow. Did not get into the humanity, the physics, the moral dilemmas, or anything else of interest outside of a very superficial treatment,  over the top ""effects"", and scenes that were meant to be artsy but failed to actually achieve anything. Typical modern Nolan. And a formula that works brilliantly on the masses, so expect mass approval of this one just like all his others.",2023-07-26 03:39:09
"I wanted to walk out.

I'm a Nolan fanboy and don't mind a biopic, but Oppenheimer just drags on for what feels like forever. The cast is incredible, the shots are nice... but it's just a really boring movie. Even they raved about not using CGI, but the shots of the bomb weren't really that amazing anyway. 

Still glad I saw it I guess, but this will be the first Nolan movie I won't re-watch religiously.",2023-07-30 05:34:57
"I feel like I’m living on a different planet or something, this is the most boring film I’ve seen in quite a long time and it was actually painful to sit through the entire thing.

"Just got back from seeing it. Not what I expected, and not in a good way. I thought it would be more technical and scientific, but it was mostly politics and inquisition. IMAX/PLF doesn't really serve a purpose in this film, believe it or not.",2023-07-21 20:48:06
"Just saw this.

I was hyping this up for a year, considering I love Nolan and everything he has done so far.

It was a good film, but unfortunately far from the masterpiece I expected it to be and what the trailers indicated it was going to be.

It focuses way too much on the political, court room drama stuff (Strauss scenes) and not enough on the scientific stuff happening with the creation of the bomb at Los Alamos. The last hour especially drags the whole film down by at least 2 points with all the names they drop and jumps between timelines.

Brilliantly acted by Cillian and all the supporting cast and beautiful on a visual, sound and production design level, but I don't think it was worth the IMAX shooting efforts just for a 7 minute detonation scene (including the build up). The entirety of the rest of the film was just dialogues, not worth to be seen in that format, as it's mostly close-ups.

And about the detonation scene, it's the first time i wish Nolan had actually used some CGI to enhance it, as it looked way too small and like they stacked couple of hundreds of kilos of TNT and blew them up.

It looks very underwhelming compared to the real restored HD footage on YT and Nolan and Hoyte tried to mask it with a few close-up shots.

I hope you enjoy it more than I did. I am seeing it again IMAX in a week and I hope i appreciate it more on a second watch.

Currently I'd give it a 7/10.",2023-07-21 22:45:04

"It's not boring. It's not distasteful. It's not bad. But is SOOOOO fucking long. Easily the longest feeling movie I think I've ever seen. Sat down in the theatre at 7.20pm and didn't stand up and leave until 10.55pm. Was I physically uncomfortable? No. But by the time we cut back to the grey hearing for the 5th time after the second act I started checking my phone for the time. Frankly, the cutting back and forth does the movie no favors when the best part of the movie is pretty damn linear and easy to follow. And frankly the ""all practical"" explosion was lacklustre. A nuke is extra-ordinary. CG would do this justice. A practical explosion left me wanting. It did not look like a nuclear explosion. [This is footage of the real Trinity test,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wki4hg9Om-k) I do not think the movie even begins to match the intensity and scale of this. 

Oh and that one reviewer who said the imagined sight of a woman's head getting blown off by a nuke was disturbing needs to go watch LITERALLY EVERY OTHER FUCKING MOVIE WITH A NUKE IN IT. T2 is still etched in my brain for the fuck no reaction I had to Sarah's dream. This was frankly pathetic, it looked like pva glue flakes being blown by a hairdryer.",2023-07-22 22:58:39

"I really didn’t care at all about the Strauss side of things. There was so little texture to RDJ‘s character I simply didn’t care about him. The black and white scenes just annoyed me and I wanted to get back to Oppi desperately. I also don’t think this movie needs to be watched in cinema. It did very little in the way of spectacular set pieces. Initially, they had some very nice effects that Oppenheimer was imagining but they dropped that entirely after the 50% mark. The explosion was also quite underwhelming to be honest. I liked the movie but it didn’t earn my numb butt in the seat",2023-07-23 19:07:36
"Was expecting something as spectacular as The Imitation Game but this one came up a bit short for me. Definitely did not need to be 3 hours. The blue-ish grey and white was bothersome for me…should have just shown us his story chronologically leading up to the hearing/Strauss’ betrayals in present. 

I also felt there were many unexplored angles - Einstein with Joseph Goebbels? The paradox of Jews working with the Nazis? Would have been interesting to delve into that more. 

I have more input to offer but others have said things along the same vein so I’ll leave it short for now. Oh, and would have loved to see what happened to Oppenheimer, Kitty, Strauss, Hill, etc. pre-credits. Did some googling myself but enjoy when those facts are included at the end.

The atom bomb test scene was pretty spectacular, though, I must say.",2023-07-23 19:20:13
"IMHO, this movie is wasted on the big screen. It's a cerebral movie, not an action movie. The dialogue is more important than anything else. Other than the ""Big Boom,"" there's nothing of importance that is better on the biggest screens. Not like *Interstellar*, *Avatar*, or *Gravity*, films which were definitely better on the biggest screens.

I also feel like the whole ""father of the atomic bomb"" thing was kind of rushed and they didn't really go into much detail about the actual engineering of the bomb or challenges they faced. I get that it's a movie about Oppenheimer, not necessarily about the atomic bomb, but the two are so closely tied together that it felt like they really rushed that part and instead decided to focus more on what happened after the atomic bomb.",2023-07-24 05:13:21

"i fucking loved this movie. I'm going to be a dick and say, it's not for everyone. Its nor a popcorn flick. This isn't a bio pic. It's not ""Elvis"" or ""Forest Gump"". It's not a ""best of"" of Americas nuclear program and it's not a war movie. This is a meditation on the sacrifice of humanity it takes to transcend it. An exploration of the Oppenheimer's failing mental state. The biggest take away is. "" He was wrong"". That the bomb should of never been made and he was a fool to make it. How someone so small could become so large. It was an exploration in foolishness and pride. Leading all involved to deeply regret their actions on either side. Our favorite germen metaphysician was really the lynchpin. I don't know if he was really so above it all in reality. (I'm aware of his letter.) However I couldn't help but to feel he was the only sane one in the picture.

EDIT: A reflection shows me the analogies between him and Prometheus. In my stifled analysis. I view them as contrasting figures. In our time at least, Maybe that's the true message. We have been given a fire we are not worthy to wield.",2023-07-26 01:35:12
"Not sure how to feel about the movie. 

I think Nolan’s recent obsession with messing with narrative timelines hinders this movie. As someone who doesn’t know anything about Oppenheimer, I had no context to why a hearing was being held about Oppenheimer. Its a nice narrative framework, but I had no idea he was being interrogated for being a suspected communist. So for 80% of the movie I wasn't sure what he was trying to prove or disprove through this narrative conceit. I had no idea we were supposed to be suspecting that anyone in particular was responsible for trying to tear him down either. I just tossed it up to McCartheism and the Red Scare. I didn’t know we were supposed to be suspecting some mastermind among the large cast of characters. I also had no idea what the black and white scenes meant. This in addition to the jarring jumps back and forth in time confused me even more. There is just too many narrative gimmicks going on with too many names and events for me to understand what was going on. I get the broad strokes, but not understanding the finer details of things made it hard to be invested or satisfied by the movie.

If the narrative were told more linearly in a conventional manner, I think it would be better. As it is, this movie feels like you need to go in already knowing the cliffnotes of his life to even follow the film.",2023-07-27 07:05:56

Movie was frustrating because I couldn't hear much of the dialogue; needs subtitles.,2023-07-27 09:27:03
"OK so here comes a bit of an effort post with all of my thoughts on this:

I'm a HUGE Nolan fan. My favorite films by him are Dunkirk, Inception, Interstellar and The Prestige. Like all of his films, I eagerly awaited this for YEARS.

I read a lot of history books anyway, so I decided 6 months ago to read ""American Prometheus,"" the book that this film is based on. It might have been a mistake to read this before seeing this film.

Having already read the fantastic ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb,"" I figured that ""American Prometheus"" would be somewhat similar. They were not similar. I noticed that a full half of the book was spent on the political witch-hunting that plagued Oppenheimer for so much of his life. I thought to myself, ""how will Nolan handle this in the film? Clearly a 3 hour epic about the father of the atomic bomb would be a tad boring for most people if it spends half of the film on this political stuff.""

So I began to worry about this but was still onboard for seeing the film of course. Christopher Nolan could release a film of a blank wall for 2 hours with no sound and I would probably buy a ticket for it. He is one of the few (maybe 3 or 4?) directors who have carte blanche with me to buy a ticket to whatever they put out in the theater.

So I finally saw it. Here are my INITIAL thoughts:

7/10 overall score.

Matt Damon was continually distracting (I was always aware that I was watching an actor named Matt Damon), although he did somewhat embody the character as described in the book.

This story seems like it would be INCREDIBLY hard to follow for someone who hadn't read the book. It's almost as if this film is just an ad for the book, because you will need to read the book afterwards to understand everything you just saw. I found the film confusing and I have read the book recently.

The film assumes that the audience knows a lot about all of the characters already, especially a lot about Oppenheimer. I don't feel that the film adequately explained Oppie and his character/motivations. We just hit the ground running with this guy that we barely know.

Cillian Murphy will get a Best Actor nomination for this role, and he deserves to win the Oscar for this role.

Robert Downey, Jr. will get a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this role, and he also deserves to win.

Random note: almost everyone in the theater was male, which disappointed me as a female. There were maybe 4-6 women in the entire theater, and 2 of them spent the entire film on their cell phones texting and looking at clothes. Anyway I thought that was interesting.

Final note: I think Nolan should have adapted ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" instead of ""American Prometheus.""

TL; DR version: my initial vote is 7/10, which might change with time.",2023-07-27 15:16:23
I felt the movie was OK but the last hour or so after the test detonation seemed to be without a point.,2023-07-31 14:23:47
"Well, I enjoyed this one. I tend to be a big Nolan detractor, but this film avoided most of his major pitfalls. 

I do feel the the film falls off a bit in the third act and overstays its welcome in terms of runtime, but that might just be me. I've soured on longer run times as of late. It's interesting to see a historical biopic that's constructed like an action film, but it's clear that it's a winning formula for Nolan. Don't think there's anything wrong with editing the film that way, and given the circumstances surrounding the development of the bomb it heightened the sense of urgency to see the creation of bomb to completion. 

I will say that I'm a bit split on the roles of both Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh. I find it refreshing that the film included Blunt as a strong, three dimensional character, but on the flip-side has Pugh plays the typical enigmatic and frustratingly emotional female archetype that so often plagues his female character. I'm hardly offended by nudity in films, but it seemed completely unnecessary in this one. Pugh's character seems to hate clothes as much as she hates flowers. 

I think people are mislabeling this as a non-linear film. It does do some things out of order, but it's fairly linear. Strauss's Senate confirmation is mostly used as a framing device to tell the story. 

Otherwise, wasn't super blown away by any of the lead performances necessarily other than Murphy. I think Cillian Murphy did a great job disappearing into the role, but RDJ and Damon are both so recognizable that it's difficult to see them as anyone but RDJ or Damon. I do give this film a lot of credit for casting a bevy of up-and-coming young actors though like Jack Quaid or Alden Ehrenreich even if their parts were relatively small. In general, it was the smaller roles that really carried this film for me. Jason Clark and Macon Blair were both fantastic as the prosecution and defense. David Krumholtz was also great in this. 

The soundtrack is a real stand out here. At times it's overbearing and almost comical in how intense it can be, but Nolan tends to make music a big part of his films. It's beautiful on its own though. I've been listening to it since I watched it on Sunday. 

At the end of the day, I'd say that between Barbie and Oppenheimer, I'd rate Barbie as the superior film (at, the very least, the more interesting film), but this is far and above my favorite Nolan film. Good to see him bounce back after Tenet.",2023-07-31 18:55:49
"This movie was great, but I'm not sure it was good.

There was too much in it.  It suffered from the two plot lines, and one of the plot lines is a hearing about a clearance.  RDJ was essentially a cartoon villain in an otherwise realistic movie.  And don't get me started on the out-of-placeness of the ""I have become death"" line in a sex scene--people literally laughed out loud in the theater

But the acting was amazing; the cast was amazing; the visuals were relentlessly amazing.

I really enjoyed it, but I don't think it is the tour-de-force people seem to think it is.",2023-08-03 04:46:43
"So dull.

It starts ok then totally gets bogged down and lost up its own backside. 

Given Nolans previous 2 efforts then oppenheimer doesn't surprise me.

His days of inspiration, brilliance and innovative appear to be sadly over.

Even Hitchcock ran out of ideas.

Oppenheimer isn't worth the effort.  Of course it's well made.

This is a film that any competent director could have made.

Given his lineage, that's a bad sign for Nolan. He made films nobody else could make.

Now he's joined the ""ordinary"" club.

Extremely fast pacing, frenetic cutting between 3 different story lines, dialogue that's yet again hard to hear over the background music, a shit load of characters accompanied by numerous name drops... I could go on. 

The scenes I did like were the ones that lasted more than 30 seconds, had discernable dialogue, had a focused story beat, and just had the damn time to breathe. Examples: The Trinity test, the meeting where they decided where to drop the bombs, Oppy meeting Truman, the last conversation between Oppy and Einstein.",2023-07-23 08:20:17
"I’m getting that a lot of people were watching this movie (a biopic) for…the bomb. And that’s where a lot of the negative viewpoints are coming from. The bomb wasn’t good enough, all the silly dialogue after the bomb scene was boring, any plot points outside of the bomb were excessive and could have been cut. It makes me chuckle. So some of you really just wanted to watch him scribble theory on a chalkboard, build the bomb, test the bomb, have an amazing CGI mushroom cloud, and then end with the bombings on Japan, some destruction porn? Maybe a side note about how he grappled with a guilty conscience or something to add a bit of theme to the movie and call it a day?

I much prefer the version of the film that we got. The bomb was a big part of his story and everything in the movie does ultimately tie to the Manhattan project, still. However, the accusations against him, his ex-colleagues boardroom depositions on his character, his political associations, Kitty’s deposition (loved that scene), this was all much more interesting to me than the very simple movie I described above, which I think many of the negative reviewers would have preferred. The version we got shows Oppenheimer as a complex individual, for example, Strauss wasn’t wrong about a lot of what he said about Oppenheimer, however, we also were showed that Oppenheimer was against the H-bomb because he was genuinely scared for humanity. I would understand if the biopic was about someone extremely dull, but I’d say J. Robert Oppenheimer had a pretty interesting life. 

Editing to add: the non-linear timeline also threw people off because I guess it does require more attention to follow. I know Nolan is sort of known for using this method now but I did LOVE it here. I think telling his story in a non-linear way and bouncing back and forth really just made the film more interesting to watch for me. Biopics inherently can be on the dry side and Nolan’s touch with the timeline jumping just made it that much more of an exciting cinema experience for me! 

9/10 from me - point docked for sound mixing.",2023-07-23 08:57:32
"People are making this out to be his magnum opus.

"Honestly it felt like 12Angry men mixed with some action sequences. Im a bit dissapointed ( i think court dramas are utterly boring)

The movie did not have to be shot on IMAX, and i feel Nolans NOCGI policy made this movie worse. It made the atomic bomb feel small.

The use of soundtrack after the TRINITY test was ridiculous. Nolan only added this because without the classic Nolan suspense soundtrack ""something is happening soon""  the last hour would feel like 4hours.

I feel like this Nolans weakest work.  although is not a bad movie. But the movie would be 10X more impactful if Nolan had cross cutted the Oppenheimer story with a Story from Hiroshima. I know its a Biopic and character study. But it felt rushed, and the movie did not move me at all. I did not feel we were at war, and the atomic bomb felt like a upscale new years rocket.

it has a lot of boners that go soft. So many missed opportunities. 

You’re building the biggest weapon on earth to stop Hitler. We find out from a no-namer that Hitler is dead in the middle of a conversation. 

The final exchanges between Downey Jr and Ehrenreich felt so badly wasted. Ehrenreich didnt even rub it in his face. It kept building and building and boom, he opens a door and we see camera flashing. Thats the “i really showed him moment” 
If it wasnt for the booming sounds and strobe light editing, we would have all fell asleep in this film. 

Not one person on earth feels sorry for Pugh’s character. We met her as a mysterious outsider and she stays that way the whole film. Not one quality to admire, just out of frame boobs thats it.

There’s just really nothing that feels like a pay off in this film. We see cameras flashing on Robert Downey, Jr., at the end… is this Nolan’s idea of a payoff? We get zero satisfaction out of what happens with him. 

The closeups on Murphy were too close and so distracting.. and what’s with all the cold sores? The camera practically ended up down his throat by the end. 

Some of the makeup they did to make people look hideous did not look believable at all. It looked like Josh Peck’s skin was sliding off his face like he was D’onofrio in Men in Black.

I feel like they originally intended for a linear timeline, realized what a boring movie they had on their hands, and then mixed it all up with kabooms and disco strobe lighting. We often walk into a scene not knowing what year it is and how high the stakes are.",2023-08-01 08:12:16

"I'll make this brief.

I'm sorry. I don't see this being Nolan's ticket to the Oscars. Put aside his ever-present issues with women, he gets a lot of the history wrong, there are some scenes that had me laughing unintentionally (don't tell me Strauss was unfamiliar with Kennedy, bad Dutch, famous quote during sex), and it lacks an emotional center for me to grab on. The aspect ratio shifts were annoying. The A-List cameos were distracting, especially Oldman's. The sound design is as incompetent as his recent flicks.

"No Country for Old Men shows how to do tension correctly in a movie. It’s about a serial killer after his latest victim. When someone’s fighting for their life, there are no bombastic horns or drums in the background, it’s just deathly silent. It was haunting to me, how much the tension was allowed to breathe organically. It felt more authentic than anything I’ve ever seen on screen. 

Compare that to this movie, where they lay the music on so heavy that you can barely hear people speak. Excessive use of music just screams “I’m trying to add emotion to a scene that I’m worried doesn’t earn it organically” and it feels disingenuous, like they’re trying to sell you something. 

This movie also drags on way, way too long. No one cares if Oppenheimer loses his security clearance, why are we on this for the literally over an hour to end the movie? I saw people leaving the theater, and I wanted to join them eventually. That’s something that should have been done in 10 minutes, then cut to credits.

I do enjoy history and this is a topic I didn't know that much about, as far as the intricate details.  After this movie I felt like I learned a lot (if accurate of course).  Any complaints about hard to understand dialogue are absent here.  Every word was crystal clear.  This while still having the usual top notch Nolan sound direction.  The tension in this movie was also incredible and really paid homage to the seriousness of the topic.  The trinity test scene was just *chef's kiss*....really edge of your seat stuff.

"Parents, please leave the kids at home for this one. A dad a couple seats down brought his young teenage sons and the one next to me got very fidgety by the halfway mark. Distractingly so. Not even mad at the poor kid for being bored during a 3 hour history biopic, mad at the dad for bringing him. I assumed it was his punishment for something lol.

Otherwise good movie, but is it just me or did anyone else not really see a difference with IMAX? In the city I live in there's a local theater chain most people go to, but I went to an AMC for the first time in a decade for the IMAX experience this was so-heavily marketed on. I feel like I could have gone to Harkins and had the same viewing experience with less cramped seating (and possibly not the fidgety bored kid).",2023-07-23 00:02:38

"I was looking forward to many of the mainstream summer movies this year. While none of them were really big disappointments, yet none of them really stayed with me as I left the theatre. I finally watched Oppenheimer on IMAX 70MM, and it exceeded all my expectations, the direction, the acting, the visual, the score, the editing, sound design everything was as close to perfect as I have seen in a while. It was talky, cerebral, political, emotionally heightened, and ultimately a great character study with Nolan’s audio visual flair. Probably one of the best movies I have seen in years. This is Christopher Nolan’s Magnum Opus as I have heard few times already. But it is dense in content, theme and ask some unsettling questions about humanity and it’s future. And it is not for everyone. Rating: 4.5/5",2023-07-24 14:37:27
"I saw it Saturday, been sitting on it for the past 2 days trying to condense what I think about it. Fair warning, I knew quite a bit about the Manhattan Project going in, and had at least a passing familiarity with most names mentioned in the movie. 

First off, it's a masterpiece. I'll be watching it again before it leaves theatres.

The choice of using music so aggressively is a risky one, but I think it mostly pays off. The constant, incessant score evolves with the movie, and really helps in ramping up the tension. I just wish there were a few more scenes where actors would be allowed to act without music, but it's a minor complaint overall.

I like the mixed timelines. It keeps setting up plot point after plot point, each adding to the tension, and the format means that they could be resolved rapid fire, like dominos falling into place.

Cinematography was stellar. I can rave about plenty of shots in the movie, but the trinity test going off was easily one of the best movie going experiences I've had. My theatre was dead quiet during the seconds preceding the blast, and you could feel the tension.

Having the entire movie (minus the B&W scenes) be from Oppenheimer's perspective was great too. It also really drove home certain points, like him not even knowing when the bomb he created was being used - we all learned about it on the radio like everyone else.

One criticism I saw a few times was the sex scenes. I think they were tastefully done and contributed meaningfully to the plot. I will agree that Jean bringing him the Sanskrit book and opening it straight to the quote was too much on the nose, however.

The final conversation the movie ends on, between Oppenheimer and Einstein, was the perfect ending to the movie. The kind that stuck with me for a few days.

Overall, the movie feels like a 2.5 hour anxiety attack. I was drained by the end of it, and I loved every moment. I don't see any other movies this year topping this one for me.",2023-07-24 15:43:40
"I loved this movie, but I noticed why I don’t watch a lot of Nolan.   His movies always have a puzzle quality.  Yes there’s payoff, there’s meaning - I respect it - but not my taste.",2023-07-25 17:22:10
"and also like wtf hughie from the boys was there for literally just the purpose of being there, i dont get why he needed to be there.",2023-07-27 02:20:46
Movie was cool. Relied on acting prowess for sure. Not sure what the movie was exactly. A drama centering around Oppenheimer or a film around Oppenheimer's life? Nolan movies imo are great and fun but never exactly masterclass. I also got lost during the trials on who was who again. Also the trinity explosion could've been more,2023-07-28 04:51:13
I did not care for the non linear story telling. The only thing that brought down the movie imo,2023-08-08 23:15:32
"It was as good a movie as you’d expect from the (arguably) best filmmaker working today.  I think he does a very good job presenting Oppenheimer as a complicated and realistic character without strongly choosing a side.

There are so many levels to read the story on.  The idea of a brilliant scientist and engineer trying to leverage his well earned esteem into a career in the world of geo-politics (where he is clearly incompetent) is the most interesting to me.  It is an example of the Peter principle at work - the story of a man outside his depth who stuck around longer than he was useful.

We’ve had a messy 70 years but there was no stopping the development of our current weapons and the fact that nobody has ended up using them (yet) seems to be fairly consistent with what one would expect from any reasonably rational actors (nuclear weapons can only really serve a defensive purpose to counter those who already have them).  In this light, Oppenheimer’s objections to the use of his work, seem quite naive and silly.  This is very well highlighted in the scene with Truman where Oppenheimer makes a fool of himself.",2023-08-21 11:55:28
"no!!! a movie with clips jumping without transition i dont understand what i'm even watching. tried it a while back, 10 mins in im out. tried again as it won 7 Oscars, 40 mins in i'm out again. 

i love Cillian and Emily, i'm surprised to see Dan Dehaan. gotta say robert jr and matt damon suprised me with their acting skilll but no, i dont see why would i keep watching.",2024-03-19 11:48:29
Lotta love for this movie in here but I gotta say. Not my cup of tea. Didn’t really care about the whole Strauss v Oppenheimer rivalry by the time it came up. Good acting. Liked the Einstein piece. But I wish I could have that 3 hours back. Boring. Could have easily been under two hours.,2023-07-21 02:54:29
" It is an extremely over engineered movie, you are trying to follow what's happening but at all times, artificial complexity makes it impossible to do so.   

In the first hour, the narrative has a premise : how/can they build the bomb. There is a logical progression in that arc. You understand what we're going toward and why it's important.  

However the movie already has its signature absurd complexity, so it's still hard to follow.  
They say that the story is built in three times: the script, the shooting and production, and the editing.  

In the script, the story probably makes sense. In this first act we have a clear premise, so we can try to hold on to the script. It's an inherently difficult story I am sure, but in three hours they had the time to lay it clearly if they had wanted to.  

The production is very impressive, but is it very good? Of course it looks good, it's well directed, well acted blablabla we get it you got all the best actors, of course it looks good.
  
The money shots are okay (just okay IMO, nothing like Interstellar space sequences), but there aren't even many of them. You really only get one smaller scale explosion, and that's it. Call me shallow, but part of why I went is for the grand spectacle, and I feel like I didn't get it.  

The Imax (Dolby in my case) technology is completely unnecessary for that reason. The vast majority of the movie is in a small room, with dialogue editing. Avatar completely justified its technology, almost all of it looked amazing. This looks amazing for like 3min out of 3 hours. Those who didn't get their premium technology ticket won't miss out on much.  


**The editing is where they truly took the script, and then put it in a blender, pressed the ""turbo destruction"" button and served us the result.** It is such a mess, it is so impossible to follow that you just feel bad for those who had to do it.   


First of all, the entire movie is in a cross editing format, meaning that different scenes get presented together. This is the style of editing that they use for example if in a cop movie, you see the bank robbers leaving and the cops leaving the station in their cars, and it keeps cutting between those two scenes happening at the same time.  

In Oppenheimer, the cross editing occurs between 4 or 5 different time periods, of course this already makes it harder to follow than editing between different places at the same time.  
Some periods also have different visual identities, with one being black and white because? 

The periods also refer to each other, since some are trials, or some not trials, idk like a hearing or whatever, I never understood that clearly.  

So that is the macro structure of the movie in how it presents its narration: cross editing between 4-5 time periods.  

Now on a sequence scale which is smaller, we keep cutting between scenes all the time, as fast as possible. There is a complex subject of discussion, being discussed very fast, and I never had time to finish understanding a sequence before we moved on to the next very fast sequence.  

There are almost no pauses in the movie. It moves so fast, you don't have time to blink if you want to have a chance at understanding it. 

By the end of the ""building the bomb"" act, I had forgotten what was happening in the other timelines, which are the subject of the next acts. When I left the cinema, I had forgotten Robert Downey Jr's role, how he got into the movie and story and why.   

I could not tell you right now what the story is about past the first hour, except for a very vague ""it's Oppenheimer's trial about if what he did was right or not"". But if you asked me about the exact characters, the exacts sequence of events, I would have literally no idea.  

 It all becomes a word soup, and at some point I just gave up on understanding it. I'm sure I could understand it if it was presented it clearly. But the never ending stream of words, cut, music, sound effects, visual effects just start to hurt the brain.
   
On a scene scale, I don't think I've ever seen such fast dialogues. The movie is 3 hours long, but there are SO MANY words to fit in, every dialogue has to be edited as fast as possible, before moving on to the next one. This is how current celebrity vloggers edit their videos about going shopping, why does a historical movie with very complex subjects need to be edited in the same style?

Some of the techniques used are actually interesting, for example at one point there is a flashback of two characters talking, but we don't need to actually know what they said, so as the second character responds, he gets cut mid sentence, which I liked.   

But it is the extreme density of it that completely spoils the creativity.  

I don't know what to say anymore, if people say it's great and perfectly understandable then I'd challenge them to write 10 lines clearly presenting the story, characters and events in a chronological manner, because I don't think it's possible.",2023-07-22 16:13:34
people are afraid to say that this movie was underwhelming,2023-07-24 20:51:52
"I enjoyed Dungeons and Dragons and Puss and Boots more than this, and I like historical and drama movies but this was kind of boring . I didnt really care about anyone because they spent so little time on everyone, I feel like I didnt even learn much about Oppenheimer himself.",2023-07-24 11:26:52
I really wish this movie was an hour shorter. It dragged SO much. I kept checking my watch every fifteen minutes once we got to the Trinity test.,2023-07-27 00:53:04
"Average. I'd rate it a 5/10, but only because I really enjoyed being able to see so many great scientific minds portrayed on screen 


The pacing was insane. It felt like I was scrolling through TikTok, honestly. No scene lasted more than 60 seconds. Characters were never allowed to sit with their feels, it was all just this rapid fire barrage of events. 


The two plots are both fine on their own, but one needed to be secondary to the other. As it stands, they're both given equal screen time, which considering it's 3 hours long, just made it feels like this was two movies cut together. 


But overall, I liked it. All the performances were fantastic. 


I do wonder how those unfamiliar with scientific history will fare though. They don't take much time to explain anything.",2023-07-21 03:22:26
"Intense movie. But way too long. The political scenes got repetitive.

The bomb scene was good. But I was slightly underwhelmed by it given the numerous ""explosive visions"" throughout the movie. The bomb scene wasn't audiovisually as cool as e.g. the lightspeed ramming scene in The Last Jedi.",2023-07-21 18:27:29
"Editing-wise, this movie felt like a 3-hour-long trailer. Or a climax stretched for an entire runtime. Jumpy, jumbled, no scene had any room to breathe. One of my most anticipated movies in a long time, but I walked out very disappointed. Wish I saw what most of y'all and the critics saw.",2023-07-22 06:14:04
"this movie was so stuffy and boring to me, I got tricked by the trailer, leading me to think that the movie was going to be more action packed and focusing on the science of the atomic bomb, as someone super into physics and chemistry. Silly me though, having read the book I should have known it was going to be a 3 hour boring film, switching flashbacks and arguments and conversations every 5 minutes. The only entertaining shot of the bomb exploding, which wasn't even over Hiroshima lasted.. what.. like 5 minutes?? I really wanted something like interstellar or the imitation game but instead I got 3 hours that I will never get back.",2023-07-22 19:02:20
"Are people insisting this movie blew them away and that you have to see it in IMAX trolling or did I watch a completely different movie? More than half of the movie is literally dialogue in a room, I actually hope someone does a time analysis of this to prove how absurd it is to say that's how it needs to be seen. This was the most unimpressive movie I've ever watched in IMAX and I've seen a lot.",2023-07-23 06:40:41

Edit: words",2023-07-21 15:12:19
"I really enjoyed the movie, but I feel slightly cheated with the previews of the bomb detonation and what was on film. I kept anticipating that scene, and then the movie was over. It kind of distracted me the last 30 minutes or so. 

That said, there are no other issues with the movie for me. Great acting across the board, I got to need out with the level of details being historical record. Great boobs. There were a few good jokes, but the audience was too in tune with the feeling of the movie, so those jokes didn't land in my viewing.

I actually loved the pace of the film. I am one of those who felt like it barely seemed like 2 hours. The music was great at building tension, with a lot of music literally sounding like a ticking time bomb. Visuals were good at satisfying, but a little CGI sprinkled in would have gone a long way. Hats off on what they got on film, though. 

Overall, I would watch again for sure and recommend it to most people. You know if you're interested in the subject matter before you go.",2023-07-21 19:26:39

"I just saw it on IMAX an what an experience.

Few comments I have:
-Thought the editing was weird. At the beginning of the movie we were shown all the events that lead to the trinity test and all the consequences of it regarding the H bomb, for the latter some in bw and some in color, but the test happened at the end of the second act. Leaving the third only with the consequences but now showing in color some scenes that were previously bw.
Part of the appeal for me at the beginning of the movie was feeling everything was connected to the test and wouldve preferred it if it happened at the very end.

-The explosion didnt look that menacing. Everything in that scene was perfect tho.

-The nudity was a bit unnecesary. 

-3 hours was too long.

8/10. Cant wait to watch the explosion again on my OLED at home.",2023-07-22 03:56:15

"I think I bought too much into the hype and I wish I would've gone into this with a more level head. I've always loved Nolan's movies, LOVED them...but this...this just never connected with me. I can't explain it either which is the most frustrating part. Maybe when I rewatch it, things will change. But for now, I'm disappointed.",2023-07-28 00:08:15
Very good movie but feel like it wasn't as well crafted as Nolan's other works and suffers for it at times. Felt like two movies tied together and he didn't quite nail it. Good performances though and I think I'll appreciate it more on a second viewing.,2023-07-29 20:44:07
One thing I didn't get was what the Senate hearing with Strauss was about. What did the Senators vote on and in which way did Strauss lose in the end? It probably was stated in the movie but I probably missed it or forgot among all the other plotlines and time jumps,2023-08-05 09:49:27
"I really can’t believe so many people here are praising it like it was some masterpiece. It was well made, but def not a 10/10 movie. It just wasn’t that entertaining imo.

[deleted],2023-07-21 05:41:47
"I may be the only one here but I really disliked this movie. I thought the dialogue for the first couple hours was just impossible, felt like I was watching something on 1.5 speed with no more than a 3 second scene cut to catch a breathe or take in what was going on. I understand there was a lot to pack in there but the speed itself was a bit much. The exposition was so dry for me. 

The scene with Florence was cringe and every scene after with her was cringe, I get that they had to build her into the story as part of oppies demise for his broken heart and the connection to the communist but it was not hitting for me.

The bomb scene was a big buildup to something not so grand. The gym scene was the best scene in the movie but nothing was gripping me even then, but I am glad they tried to include some terror with it but they could have went a lot deeper with the shame and guilt. 

I felt this movie was a hollow, autistic reading of a long Wikipedia article that attempted to humanize and give a story to Oppenheimers character through a hyper-Americanism. they could have focused a little more on the guilt and terror for the Japanese people instead of the political brawl that felt almost Adam McKay style at times, this wasn’t a huge cabinet position they made it out to be to be fighting for.

The score was beautiful, the acting was incredible especially by Emily blunt and Murphy, the costuming was beautiful as well. 
The albert scenes were a bit corny to me but the last scene was the best one. 

As someone who spent many years studying the war I just didn’t like the narrow portrayal of this story. 

4/10 from this peanut gallery.",2023-07-21 05:58:35

The movie didn’t have to be 3 hours long. Pacing was somehow super fast and so slow at the same time. So many characters to keep track of. Especially at the end with the drawn out court scene. He just became the destroyer of worlds and we’re supposed to care that his security clearance isn’t getting renewed? I get that it’s his reputation but he just changed the world. Someone please explain this to me,2023-07-21 14:43:32
"The whole last act with Strauss was a total dud for me, and honestly did not care for his inclusion of the movie at all. It felt like a total drag and I wanted more of Oppenheimer dealing with the aftermath of what he created",2023-07-22 01:03:46
"Am I the only one who didn’t really like it? Acting was amazing, but I could barely even follow the movie jumping back from different points of time so often. It didn’t really feel like it had a focused plot either like the conflict and goals kept changing 

Then the bomb part came and I was like oh yeah bomb time! It was cool but nothing crazy and I kept thinking about drake and Josh for some reason. Then the big twist about who the bad guy is because Oppy hurt his feelings. Then another hour of political stuff and the end. I really wanted to like it but it was just sooooo long. I feel like the Chernobyl mini series is like what I hoped this would be (with how they handled the court stuff, explaining reactors, and radiation action etc) anyway just my 2 cents",2023-07-22 05:23:04

"Good movie, the sex scenes were unnecessary imo.

Also sucks I got spoiled that they nuked Japan",2023-07-24 05:00:30
"I would give it a 7/10. And I'll just paste in my thoughts from another sub.

It needed a good 30 minutes cut off it. Primarily off the beginning. Distracting editing decisions. (The jumping around in time.). I just don't get the point or decision in making parts in black and white. It's mostly the future stuff with RDJ and I just don't get it. If it were *everything* in the flash forward scenes, fine. If it were of every scene in the future with *just* RDJ then fine. If it were only the most distant past scenes, fine. But it isn't. It's just random it felt like.

And another inconsistency about it. If you start off the movie with this artsy fartsy 'This is how his mind works. This is how he thinks' abstract imagery. Shaky lines and circles and stars moving around. Even if I find that sort of stuff personally annoying and pointlessly artsy for artsy sake. If you are going to do it then be consistent with it. If this is how you show how he thinks. Then show it the whole time. Show it overwhelming him during the points in time when you know, he was thinking the most. Under the most pressure. While as head of the project, when figuring out the science, etc. But it's just randomly at the beginning and then pops up again a little towards the end.

Also there is no need to see this in IMAX like it's been advertised.

Where was the conclusion? You made us sit through the overall pointless early stuff in the movie about his life but we don't get even text on screen at the end telling us ""So and so went on to ....... and died in 19....."", ""There are xxx nuclear weapons in the world today, many of which are capable of xxx megatons......"" etc, etc. That sort of thing. After all that it somehow felt like it ended without a conclusion.

And last, and what I'm sure will get me the most flak. And admittedly maybe it's just me being very specific. But if ever there was a need for the use of cgi for something that you just can't pull off with practical effects. The Trinity test is one of them. There is actual video of the test. Seen it all my life. Most of you probably have too. We know historically and factually what the explosion looked like. He uses an, I'm sorry but some slow motion close up shot of a small explosion that was probably just a gas can blowing up and passes that off as a nuclear test. No. Just, no.

Yet it was a good movie. Well, two thirds of it was a good movie. Wouldn't watch it again. I'd rather just watch a good documentary on him and the subject again. Seen lots of those already",2023-07-24 22:58:59
"After 3 hours, did I really get a sense of what made Oppenheimer tick and how he felt about being part of such a momentous part of history? Sort of but not really. I got some impressive sound mixing, a few truly gripping sequences of cinema and about 2 hours of middle aged men having an HR review. 

Nolan’s best? Not even in his top 5.",2023-07-27 08:49:12
"I just got back from seeing it. Loved everything focused on the science and development of the bomb and the ethical implications.

I strongly disliked the remaining biopic elements about Ops communist connections and the subsequent harassment. This makes it feel like two films woven into one and I feel that the most interesting elements which could have been explored were sacrificed for the mundane biographical themes.

I was also expecting the tension after the Trinity tests to lead into an impressive technical Hiroshima scene perhaps imagined by Oppenheimer. Not sure where this expectation came from but I just felt it needed a bigger punch.",2023-07-29 20:45:29
"It was visually beautiful but I had a few issues with the movie.

1) there was very limited discussion of science and the dialogue that was there was very poor; for instance“I read your paper on molecules”. Really molecules? I would have preferred if it felt more like we really watching real scientists and not soap opera characters. For a movie about one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, it didn’t really teach me anything about science.

2) the tone of the movie was so melodramatic and silly. The whole tortured genius thing at the beginning, the swirling lights in his mind. The scene where he first met his wife felt so unreal, like no two humans would every speak like that.

None of these things are really issues, and many movies could take on this tone to good effect, but given the subject matter of this movie I think it was a poor choice and detracted from my enjoyment of it a lot. I thought the overall plot was interesting and I did like the editing choices, but I just wish the movie had a bit more realism.",2023-07-31 04:00:06
"I just watched it and I'm unsure of whether I liked it or not. Its too long, very heavily dialogue driven, and as with every Nolan movie the sound is mixed in a way that makes much of the dialogue difficult to discern. There's also almost no point of watching it in Imax except for maybe that one scene or a few topographic shots here and there.

But I was absolutely blown away by the performance of the cast. Some of the notable standouts to me where Robert Downey, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, and of course Cillian Murphy. 

I feel like I need to rewatch every Nolan movie at home with subtitles to determine my opinion of it, and this one is no exception.",2023-07-21 08:48:46
"It's a shame they had to butcher real history to make Oppenheimer more likable -- he never picked the poisoned apple up and tossed it, the teacher simply didn't eat it, somehow people found out and he was nearly expelled; he was saved by his parents who gave money to the school.

Another scene is the discussion of criticality or chain reaction; originally it was Oppenheimer's acquaintance who told him about a test that was successful, Oppenheimer dismissed it as impossible, and only upon seeing it did he realize how it worked.",2023-07-22 23:20:50
"The movie was hard to follow. I got the general gist of the plot, but couldn't pick out the details because of the poor sound mixing at some parts, especially the beginning. I had a hard time hearing what the characters were actually saying. You would think Nolan would make it easy to make out what the characters are saying in such a dialogue heavy movie... but I guess not. I still admired the acting, cinematography and music, but it was a bit dull. I wish the courtroom scene played a more minor role in the story because I found those parts very boring and hard to follow.",2023-07-23 08:55:05

It's really weird so many people now  call Interstellar a masterpiece and his best work. When it was released they were really nitpicking it and making it out to be a film full of flaws. Incredible to witness the cult following it gained and how good it aged. I feel the same thing will happen to Oppenheimer.

I found the film to be exciting for 20 minutes and then boring for the next 20 on a constant loop. The non-linearity added nothing to the film apart from revealing what Oppy said to Einstein at the end. I also found that there was unnecessary attention on Oppenheimers personal life that added nothing to the movie. Beautifully shot and acted though,2023-07-27 23:25:17
This was Nolan's best film. Some real substance and some challenging questions for the audience. Perhaps not so friendly to streaming audiences.,2023-07-28 00:02:28
"So, the Ironman was there only as villain of the story that gave Oppie & by extension the audience a win at the last, right? Also, Ironman's aide was clearly Team Oppie all the way in. RDJ killed it, though.

Despite the fact that Oppie knew that makers of the bomb don't have any say in how it is used, and Truman telling Oppie that no one cares who made the bomb when they know the guy who dropped it, both men knew exactly what they did & signed up for but wanted to be reassured by people around them that they did their duty. Now, the beauty of moral conundrums is it can drag on for life. 

Was Oppie a player because Florence Pugh's character didn't make sense to me? It was very much like Forrest Gump's girlfriend only for nerds. 

I loved the touch they did with Einstein. I also loved how what Oppie & Albert talked about was far more important than some senator because they are too smart to talk about politics.

Nolan has ability to pull your focus in, and he did. Better than Tenet. 

Nothing great about Music. There's no segment that's like No Time for Caution or other Interstellar or Inception themes. 

Genius is not wisdom is such a powerful line. Oppie is a scientific genius who almost killed a guy because he was annoyed by him.

A good movie.",2023-07-29 17:18:56

theres literally no point in seeing this in imax. the movie was solid but felt like a big opportunity for visuals in testing/developing the bomb? overally pretty disappointed ngl,2023-07-22 06:05:07
The actual Trinity explosion felt so underwhelming when the whole movie has been building up to it. I enjoyed the movie but to me it felt like if in Titanic it only showed the ship scraping the iceberg and then the rest of the movie focuses on old lady Rose,2023-07-22 08:28:01
"I love Nolan and was excited about this film. I gave it an 8/10 in the poll and I'd definitely recommend people go see it. The acting was superb and seeing it in a theater will blow you away with the sound alone. This film should win Oscars, and it likely will.


That being said, this is not the best Nolan film I've ever seen and I definitely have some issues with it.


The biggest problem is a lack of focus. This could/should have been a film about the Manhattan Project. There's more than enough story there to fill an entire television series. Instead, we get a very long, convoluted story about a cabinet appointment of a character who isn't central to the Manhattan Project at all. The atomic bomb explosion happens with about an hour left. That should've been the climax of the film, not the end of the 2nd act. On top of that, there are a LOT of characters in this film. And a lot of them are unnecessary and serve to make the plot overly complicated.


But yeah, visually stunning and very impressive sounding with great acting by everyone. If you haven't seen it yet, I think you'll have a good time if you temper your expectations a bit.


Downvote away.",2023-07-22 19:49:20
This movie was honestly pretty mid. I would have walked out if I had gone by myself. The political/courtroom rivalry was the worst part of the movie for me and they chose to spend what time they had there. Instead of Oppenheimer as a man and his personal relationships with other characters which was much more interesting. Also I wanted to know about the actual creation of the bomb. Which felt completely glossed over. I don't care about his political believes or his reputation.,2023-07-22 04:59:10
"Went for the Barbie / Oppenheimer combo today. Oppenheimer. Man what a bust, that's kind of it. I was falling asleep at certain points, not because I was tired, more because I was bored.

I'm aware what this kind of movie is, but it ventures into ground and breaks so surface level that I can't actually get hooked in. It's going all over the place all the time, the time jumps, skips, unsure what period you're in. It's a mess, honestly. At a point I found there were so many characters and people in the background that I wasn't quite sure who was who at certain points. It reminds me of the chaotic nature of uncut gems, but it doesn't need to be..?

I'm in the minority. Reddit and the film community absolutely adore this film. I need more from a film than ""wow actor is good and the camera direction is fantastic"". 

>!What I don't accept is more time spent on a damn un-needed sex scene than there was in the entire film even mentioning radiation. It was such a glossed over topic. I coulda sworn that guy running out the bunker to get a raw look would have resulted in something happening, but nothing happened!! This was the vibe throughout much of the film. Pearl Harbour had about 3 seconds dedicated to it. I know this is about the main man, but come on, can we explain a bit about the background. It's a three hour film for fuck sake.<",2023-07-23 00:15:51
"As someone that read the first handful of chapters of American Prometheus and is generally interested in the subject matter this was pretty disappointing for me unfortunately =/ 

I constantly felt like every scene was a missed opportunity. 

I never felt like it truly came together and overall I think to me this felt lesser than the sum of its parts 

Good acting for the most part, scenes were well shot, if it truly had zero cgi that’s impressive, all good 

That said, given the man and given the deadly serious subject matter this movie felt like it soft balled everything 

To me this movie ironically felt like a very pop sci, clickbait kind of adaptation 

Which is funny given the framing device and the whole conflict between the government’s concerns about Oppenheimer’s words and actions that the movie itself would also sort of hold back on the horrors and gravitas in its retelling 

it just kind of felt more like a Ron Howard movie than Nolan to me, like obviously his style is here and in the end I’m glad he, a non-American made this movie instead of an American director

They might’ve gone even softer on portraying the U.S. government in a nicer light or something so I’m still glad this is Nolan. I just think the story never came together well enough for me and I didn’t find it very interesting in terms of cinematography.

I’ve also never liked Ludwig Goransson’s music so that was almost a complete miss for me, I’m overall glad that Zimmer is on DUNE but I’ve really missed him in Nolan’s last two projects 

I’ll definitely watch it again when my girlfriend and our friends do a barbenheinmer double feature but on a first watch I felt kind of disappointed and dissatisfied with a lot of the choices and for me it never really came together as a story or movie very well which sucks because I want to love every movie I ever watch but especially those I already am primed to enjoy like this one with subject matter I’m interested in and a director I usually mostly enjoy 

Maybe I’ll have different thoughts as I sit with it longer and when I watch it again but for now I think I’ll say I found it mostly unsatisfying, wanting it to tap into untapped potential, but overall glad it exists and appreciative of the craft and performances. 

Wish I’d enjoyed it more.",2023-07-23 22:20:51

"Poor characterization and pacing. Nolan really can't build an interesting character other than the Joker to save his life. 

He relies way too much on talented actors on that front. He's good at making plots, but in this case he was limited because he was trying to be historically faithful.",2023-07-28 04:14:14
"This movie could've been way better if they just get rid of the Strauss plotline and just focus entirely on the creation and detonation of a-bomb. As a result, the movie felt very unfocused with most scenes not allowed to breath. The movie felt less drama and way more thriller with how it's edited.",2023-08-05 18:10:14
"This film has me kind of in a knot really. I really want to like it but it is messy. I think the 3 narratives aspect was good on paper but just messy in execution because the film's flow is chaotic. 

I like Cillian Murphy but he is not a main lead in a movie kinda guy because I think a different actor would have done more. I know part of his character line was he was a martyr but Murphy does not really do presence well. I think he gets kind of cucked by his peers in this film especially against RDJ who dominates this film in a good way.

If RDJ was not in this film it would be unbearable honestly because he is the best actor in this film though the supporting cast was very strong Murphy just feels weak so the supporting cast actually raise him up a bit.

It's too long and honestly, I was expecting more existential crisis but Barbie had me covered at that.",2023-07-21 21:16:43
"First movie I watched in cinema this year that I would give a bad rating. 

It just feels like the movie doesn't know what it wants to be and so it drags on for 3 hours. If it is the story of building the atom bomb, then great, leave out the entire hearing and court sections afterwards. If it is a political thriller, then do it the other way around. If it is about the life of Oppenheimer, then include his past and later life more, and cut down on the RDJ plotline.

No sense of scale, NOTHING like the actual footage on youtube which is 100x more impressive.

"Initially, as soon as I heard about the film's production, I wanted to see it.  
I really wanted to see the movie, not because it's directed by Nolan (although I did like Interstellar) but because I like biopics.  


Apparently, it was a mistake to think that this was either a biopic about Oppenheimer or a story about the Manhattan Project.  
If it's a film about Oppenheimer, why doesn't it show his childhood and teenage years up until his death?  
If it's a film about nuclear weapons, why not show more of the technical/scientific challenges? We see almost nothing about the bomb itself.  
I think it would be better to call it The Oppenheimer Hearing, because apparently, in this film, the main point is this safety hearing.  
And even if the film was called that, they never explained what that audition was about. Why it's important. What possibilities/roles this security clearance gives the person who has it.  
Another point that I didn't liked is the constant flashbacks. Normally, I don't have a problem with multiple flashbacks. But here, I couldn't find any logic behind it. Normally, when there are flashbacks, it's just after a discussion between two characters that calls up something in the past, a moment when the character is thinking about a past moment.  
Here, the scenes have nothing to do with each other. We see Oppenheimer filling glasses with marbles and then we go on to the trial, with no connection whatsoever.

"I can’t be the only one who was dissappointed by this movie. It’s pretty great, but in interviews people were talking about it like it was the film of the century and… it was kinda bland imho. Bit of a letdown. 


ESPECIALLY the trinity test. We’ve been hearing for months how Nolan refused to use cgi. We all joked he was gonna detonate a real bomb. 10-15 min prior tensions starts to build, then the test is finally about to happen, I’m on the edge of my seat, I turn to my friend and say “this is it!” aaaand…. Meh. I paid imax tickets for this?? Honestly I don’t think I would’ve missed much if I’d seen it in a regular screen.


Also, was anyone else weirded out by the pacing at the beginning? Felt like I was watching a really long trailer, just bits and pieces of footage instead of the actual full scene. 


It’s a really great flick, Cillian Murohy kills it, obviously, as does Damon. Definitely going to see it again, and maybe my opinion changes then, but it’s not on my top 3 Nolan movies of all time, not even my Top 5.",2023-07-21 07:13:05
"Watched this in Belgium (in English), I think the opinions between American viewers and the rest of the world are going to be stark. Near the end there were people actually leaving before the movie ended because I assume they were bored from the amount of dialogue and politics that the movie finishes with. 

I think the movie has been totally overhyped, oversold and misrepresented in a way, the memes and marketing might lead people to expect a different sort of film. While it is an objectively amazing piece of film, I think people not familiar or in tune with American politics might get left behind. 

Mind you, I think Nolan did a stellar job managing to tell such a complex story in a relatively short 3 hours, there were so many different characters coming in and out- all with their own hidden agendas, popping into the past and the future all the time, its actually quite remarkable that the audience is able to keep up at all.",2023-07-21 10:00:11
"i really disliked the movie. got more knowledge about the dangers of atomic weapons from metal gear solid ngl.
they did florence pugh’s character dirty, i think it was odd how they left out the fact that oppenheimer proposed to her twice during their relationship- instead of the very real connection to her that irl oppy had we instead see him have 2 one night stands with her, then 2 hours later she’s brought up during the interrogation as if his connection to her was damning But we never see this in the film.
a lot of the writing was kinda cringe, the “i am become death” thing in the middle of the trinity test?
rdj should’ve been petting a white cat towards the end, he literally rubs his hands together like dr doofenshmirtz when he’s revealed to be the ‘villain’ of the story, not to mention the “maybe oppy && einstein were talking ab things more important than you” line that one guy said to rdj’s character in the last few minutes. felt like dialogue in a tumblr story where everybody claps at the end. all 2 women have zero screen time && only serve the story insofar as they have sex w oppenheimer, emily blunts character unironically goes from ‘bitch wife out of a boomer comic strip->finally supports oppenheimer when he creates the bomb’. i have more to say but jesus, what a disappointment this movie was for me. i didn’t see any real character study or anything else that other ppl got out of this movie && i feel like i’m missing out on smth fundamental ab it. last thing, oppy in the first act, as a student, dreams of the atom. no joke, he just dreams && sees atoms && string theory, bc he’s j super super smart ig. so cringe. also the nonstop scenes of ppl just spewing exposition, like the guy interviewing rdj (“and then what happened, rdj? how did that make our main cast feel? what did they do about it?”) okay i’m finished thanks for reading",2023-07-21 20:16:16

"Just out of Oppenheimer and I hated it! I seem to be in the minority though. Just thought the whole thing was a self indulgent mess.   
  
It's confusingly shot in that some scenes are out of sequence (for what reason, I don't know  other than it's Nolan's thing) but then he makes RDJ's scenes black and white for some reason, which at first makes you think it's the past, but his scenes are actually in the future. Its just that they use black and white for his perspective for whatever reason, and combined with the non linear telling is ugh.  
  
Every piece of dialogue is exposition and spoken like they are on fast forward and rushing to get to the next scene. If it isn't exposition, it's sexposition with him saying the ""destroyer of worlds"" line in a cringey sex scene with Florence Pugh who is for some reason naked for 90% of her screen time, including a weird scene in a deposition where she feels really out of place.  
  
The two women in the film feel borderline extraneous. The film never stops long enough to explore things it raises like why the dynamics in his relationships were weird.  
  
They didn't do a good job building the tension between RDJ and Oppenheimer because at the end of the movie, I was still vaguely confused about why their beef was so deep other than Oppenheimer made a joke about isotopes and he thought he said something to Einstein about him. I didn't really know there was much of an issue at all until RDJ went into full Saturday morning cartoon soliloquy. Then the weird wink at the camera moment when they mentioned JFK like they were teasing a future Avengers movement or something.  
  
It didn't feel like it had anything new to say. It was barely a biopic and more a collection of intellectual conversations in different rooms at breakneck speed.",2023-07-23 15:16:33
"I would just begin with saying that maybe the movie was a bit too over-hyped for what it actually is. And if you disagree you should probably stop reading.
  
The plot feels too mixed up, showing so many different points at the same time. It feels like we're watching a different story while at the same time it doesn't. It was particularly a bit difficult to understand what exactly was going on in a few scenes along with who exactly were a few people were.  
  
From a cinema point of view, it accomplishes a lot of things from beautiful cinematography and acting,etc. But in terms of enjoyability, its just not quite there, the long runtime doesn't really help either. It just falls a bit apart in the story telling department or maybe that's just me. It just feels like a movie that I would enjoy a lot of more when watching it at home at my own leisure contrary to what Nolan and some people have to say. Now you would probably argue that it's necessary to watch it in the cinema for the bomb testing but I feel like that part was pretty underwhelming but once again maybe that's just me. Maybe my experience  turned a bit sour, having to hold in the urge to pee until the interval but it wasn't quite fun afterwards either.  
  
It's a good movie no doubt but there's just too much stuff going on which can lead to confusion and being confused isn't really all that fun. I might just watch it again when its available digitally to compare it to the theatrical experience.  
  
I would just like to add on it by saying that the movie managed to show just how terrifying the bomb is and how terrified the people were but at the same time it just feels like there's something missing for the whole thing which was present in a few moments and ofcourse the actual quote given by Oppenheimer in real life which just gives me the chills.

"I can't think of a movie I've ever cared about characters less in than Oppenheimer. I even cared more about 'the protagonist' in Tenet who doesn't even have a name and I didn't think that was possible.

If the entire 3 hours of dialogue was actually engaging and there was zero bomb scene, I could have loved it. The dialogue was so boring that they constantly had to have music playing behind every word that sounded like it was building up to some grand revelation after every sentence. The words had no meaning or impact on their own and were even worse once you noticed the one dimensional trick they used all movie trying to make you feel something with music instead of characters, good story and dialogue.

I absolutely love well made movies with just dialogue. Did a movie like Before Sunrise need to have music playing the entire time to feel emotion and a connection to the characters?",2023-07-24 19:09:30

Felt unbearable, dialogs just didnt stop for a second which contributes to make the film feel like it was never going to end... and it actually didn't, 3 hours that in my mind felt like 4 or 5. By the trial I was completely exhausted.
Worst of all, I expected something of hiroshima and nagasaki other than just.. more dialog about it. The only detonation was an underwealming explosion that looked like 90 special effects.
Im not trying to be a dck about this, I reallly expected Oppie to blow my mind like other Nolan films, but this was just painful.

"Disliked this a lot. I'm quite invested in the history of this era and I can't believe how dirty Nolan has done so many people. Everyone rattled off exposition and surface-level history constantly for the first 2 hours, then we rush through the Trinity preparation to get to the massively underwhelming explosion. You can go watch Trinity test footage. It looks much grander than what Nolan achieved here. I guess you start to understand the difference between 25kt of TNT vs however many 0.000something kt Nolan could use. It just wasn't impressive, even if the silence was. Just reading about the test and accounts from those there will give a more true and impressive mental image of how it actually looked.

Beyond that, we get to a bogged-down finale in a rivalry that's hard to care about because the film spends so much time jumping between timelines from the beginning that we never get to dwell on why exactly the Strauss-Oppenheimer rivalry is so important to both. Ok it's about one getting a cabinet position and the other not being convicted of being a commie... but do we really care about that? We don't get to know their history at all beyond the H-bomb talks and half of that is spent trying to set up the thinly strung relationships oppie had with others. Dr. Hill's support for Oppie also seems to come from nowhere given how little time we spend with him... But it's like Nolan has self-inserted here. He immediately starts with Oppie as a 'visionary' who sees what he feels and is burdened by visions of the hidden world of quantum mechanics, but abandons it quickly. Nolan sees a great man but I'm not sure he knows why Oppenheimer, not anyone elese involved, was as great as they were. If he did we wouldn't brush over some of the most incredible achievements of 20th-century physics and have them play 2nd fiddle to Oppie every time they come up. If you read quotes from that time, you'll also find that people were saying things far more profound and insightful and *human* than Nolan's stiff, unnatural dialogue.

Fundamentally I hope someone comes along and does a miniseries about the Manhattan project so we can get a much more faithful, much grander display of what actually went down. There's too much to explore in a 3-hour film that also wants to mainly be about one man.

And that's the other issue. Oppenheimer's demons were numerous but he also had a much depper and much more troubled heart than the film even begins to cut into. He grew up sickly and depressed and it haunted him, but barring the one scene after Jean dies, we don't really see how he dragged his own self-burden along with him much BEFORE the bomb was used (also we don't see how enthusiastic he was about using radiation as a weapon).

Details matter in history. Lots of little things add up and can't just be treated as name-drops for those with surface-level knowledge. The deep cuts cut deep and let a lot out. A really good biopic like *First Man* knows this and takes the time to develop those little details. Possibly the only time Oppenheimer achieves this is when he has a vision of the auditorium being bombed while cutting it with a patriotic speech. That sort of duality feels like it should have been much more present throughout.

*Oppenheimer* fizzed as a film. It didn't live up to its own promise and it seems Nolan can't uncouple his own idea of a great man from himself, and once he's read and absorbed something at a surface level he wants to lecture you on it. He has characters who speak in ultra-basic physics because he himself isn't a scientist but likes to imagine that all it takes is knowing that little bit and magicking exposition out of thin air to explain everything. But reality doesn't work like that, and it's the insightful and personally deep conversations, and the messes and accidents and fumbles that keep things interesting. A waste of a good cast... maybe next time?",2023-07-21 23:51:40
"As someone who has deep dived on the trinity test, the nuclear arms race, archive footage, etc. This movie was a huge disappointment. I was told I NEEDED to shell out $18 for a ticket to see it in large format... And then I got a biopic. Why can't a biopic show the scale and gravity of the explosion anyways?? Wouldn't it make the seriousness of it more understandable to casual audiences? 

I don't want to hear this ""no CGI"" purity crap either. What about interstellar and Inception? You could even argue those movies PERFECTLY prepared Nolan to do the explosion justice. Show the hydrogen bomb too while you're at it. Show how far nuclear arms evolved alongside the growing guilt Oppenheimer felt as he got older. 

The entire Straus storyline felt entirely pointless too me. They could've cut every single black and white scene and the movie would've lost nothing. It's almost like Nolan didn't get the budget, or access to archive footage he wanted, so he had to pivot to the political story to fill the gaps. Idk. This movie was MAYBE an 8/10 for me, but the blatant false marketing about how I HAD To see it on a massive screen brings it down to a 6/10.",2023-07-25 03:24:12
"There's a line in this movie where one of the characters says ""You're not self-important, you're actually important."" This line stuck with me, because I think this is how the movie actually sees itself. Oppenheimer is an important person, and nukes are serious business, so any movie about Oppenheimer and nukes is allowed to be as bloated and self-important as it wants.

This movie was not good. None of the drama was compelling. Even after three hours of watching this tripe I didn't feel like I knew or understood any of these characters on a deep or familiar level.

The movie barely even tries to make the audience connect with Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's sympathies with the Communist Party are barely explored. Oppenheimer's romantic relationships are barely explored. Oppenheimer's attempt to poison his professor is glossed over. Oppenheimer's guilt over the nuke is used to bludgeon the audience over the head, but not in a way that actually teaches anybody anything. I know he feels remorse, but in real life remorse tends to be a nuanced emotion. Oppenheimer's remorse is presented to the audience in the form of ear rape and unexpected nudity.

When Truman called Oppenheimer a crybaby, I should've been outraged. Instead I was like, ""Yo, this dude's got a point."" This would've been impossible had Nolan actually given me any reason to connect with Oppenheimer's character.

Bad movie. 4/10.",2023-07-25 07:25:14
"Some moments in the film that were supposed to be very deep just had me rolling my eyes. For example in the last scene, the ""I believe we did"" line didn't need to be so delayed, it was already obvious he was going to say that, honestly a cringeworthy way to end the film

Nolan's ""batman banter"" type of humor didn't really fit

The timeline with the flashbacks etc. wasn't entirely clear

The whole things about his wives/girlfriends is a bit rushed? Why didn't the first one want flowers? Why did the second one agree to leave her husband 5 seconds after meeting oppenheimer? 

The purpose of the hearings wasn't entirely clear either, but not sure if that was because I lost focus

Good film apart from that",2023-07-25 22:53:42
"Watched in a 15/70mm IMAX theater with 1.43:1 resolution... Can't be the only one that thought this format was completely unnecessary for what was basically a McCarthy era legal drama?

Presenting everything from Oppenheimer's PoV felt a bit gimmicky. The movie could have really done more with the Trinity test (show us some CGI atom fission) and at least shown us the Hiroshima bombing and civilian casualties, CGI aerial shots of a nuked city etc.",2023-07-27 13:29:12
"  
Technically excellent movie however it became a chore to watch and was over-hyped IMO. It wasn't a particularly intriguing or even gripping movie. The last hour was simply a yelling and argument simulator that made the same point *ad nauseam* and for the most part was redundant. 

The marketing hype insisting it needs to be watched on Imax, presumably for the big Trinity explosion, fooled us all. Again, a technically excellent scene however would have been perfectly fine on a regular screen.

Acting was very good throughout, however I can't shake the feeling Matt Damon was a misstep in casting - he just didn't suit the role for me.",2023-07-29 07:49:44
"I gotta be honest, it was a good movie but I, like I’m sure many others, bought tickets to be wowed by the nuclear bomb test. Personally I thought it was underwhelming, all the hype and build up and I just couldn’t help but feel disappointed. I had to go back to the actual footage, it’s incredible and it still gives me chills, left me thinking why couldn’t they match it (imo). Maybe if they used CGI, they could have really put it into perspective how powerful/massive it actually was.",2023-08-19 02:54:02
"People talking: IN IMAX

I thought this was just generally dull and a different director might have chosen to put something more interesting in front of their 70mm 15 perf camera than men in suits talking. Apparently that's how they built the atomic bomb they just talked about whether oppenheimer was a communist or not for hours and then poof there is a bomb. But how do you cinematically show the scale of destruction and the horror unleashed? You have the main character learn about it while listening to the radio. WTF, Chris, seriously? Why is it an interesting question whether this one guy is good or \*gasp\* even a communist? What about the thousands and thousands of people who died? Holy shit, I had no idea the atom bomb could be so boring.",2023-08-20 02:48:49
"Just watching this movie now and definitely disappointed, considering the hype. Choppy, poor character development. Not a movie I would watch again",2023-11-27 01:22:16
"Obviously Nolan should stick to his own fictional creations, because his idea of an interesting story from history isn't as interesting as he thinks it is.

Knowing the subject matter, I was expecting it to make for a rather dull movie, but it was perhaps more dull than I expected.

Many of the actors looked so weird that it was distracting. No idea what was going on in the makeup department for this film.

Amazingly, I felt they did a poor job of developing Oppenheimer's character. It's never really shown why people revere him so much (pre-bomb), they just keep saying they do over and over. That doesn't work.",2023-11-28 05:19:07

"It's a good, not great film. I've also learned watching a Nolan film on opening day is the worst way to experience it.",2023-07-21 10:26:59
"Oppenheimer has received polarized reactions from viewers. American audiences seem more receptive to the complex, dialogue-heavy plot dealing with the development of the atomic bomb. However, viewers outside the U.S. appear less engaged, with some even leaving the theater before the ending due to the heavy emphasis on American politics and history.  
  
While the marketing created great anticipation, the actual film differs from expectations. The trailers promised a different kind of movie than the cerebral, conceptual biopic Nolan delivered. Though an impressive cinematic achievement, Oppenheimer challenges audiences unfamiliar with mid-20th century U.S. politics and World War II.  
  
In just three hours, Nolan ambitiously weaves together numerous historical figures and intertwining storylines across past and present. It's remarkable that audiences can follow such a convoluted plot at all. But the film's sophistication may frustrate viewers hoping for a more straightforward drama about the creation of the atomic bomb.  


I strongly believe it would have made a really great 3 Episodes 1h30 each show.",2023-07-21 10:38:32

3 hours wide-eyed close ups",2023-07-22 12:08:40
"It was great but I honestly had higher expectations. I wanted to see the bombings and every aftermath aspect from it, I also think it was unnecessary to focus that much on the trial with RDJr, other aspects could have been touched.
Also the trinity test bomb was underwhelming, didn't resemble atomic bombs at all.
I don't get why I'm being downvoted. I seriously wanted myself to love this but it was kind of a let down. I remember working on middle school presentations about these events and when years later I saw the teaser I was extremely hyped, now mildly disappointed.",2023-07-23 04:21:52
"Too loud for me. Standard imax El Dorado hills California. I'm thinking something went wrong? As other people also complained.

Only other disappointment was the explosion. It was small and unimpressive. All that black soot is a tell tale sign of a gasoline or other liquid fuel explosion.
Please Nolan you got to know when cgi is needed.",2023-08-11 02:21:40
Nolan's script felt like it was written by Aaron Sorkin or any other fast paced screenwriter and props to Nolan for not utilizing his intersecting timeline and give us an authentic historical biopic thriller,2023-07-21 04:03:40
"I am bummed out that Nolan decided not to show anything regarding the actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I wanted to leave the theater shocked to my core with the horrors that the innocent people there have been subjected to. It would have been more impactful, and make the people in my theater leave speechless, and not talking like they did. I know its about Oppenheimer himself , but there were scenes of him imagining the bomb going off around him, with only a really fast shot of a girl's face somewhat peeled and a burned corpse. Not enough to really make us grasp truly  the hell on earth that the bomb unleashed on hundreds of thousands of japanese civilians. Also Im done seeing movies on opening week, just cant cope with people talking around me, such a mood killer. Overall a great movie, 8.5 for me. Not as good as Interstellar for me.",2023-07-21 05:38:40

"Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School. In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society School, which had been founded by Felix Adler to promote training based on the Ethical Culture movement, whose motto was ""Deed before Creed"".

The sound design and soundtrack can’t be praised enough. I was tense and gripping my seat each time waiting for the BOOM and I love how it hit for the big one. All the preceding trial runs had a delayed sound compared to the visual explosion foreshadowing how the actual bomb would play out. Finally during the scenes of Oppenheimer addressing the audience with the lights flashing we as the audience also know that a large sound is coming and we are enveloped with anticipation.,2023-07-22 00:36:15
"I loved everything about this, especially the scene where Oppenheimer speaks to the crowd and goes through a panic attack of some kind as he hallucinates the room getting bombed. But I had such a hard time understanding the dialogue. It might be my issue or the theater’s issue, but it sounded like a lot of the dialogue was muffled or people were talking in a low volume. I wish I watched it with captions lol",2023-07-22 03:36:35
"enjoyed this immensely. i will have to watch dunkirk, insomnia and the following (as they are three Nolan films i havent seen) and rewatch the others but if i had to rank the nolan filmography off memory (for the ones ive seen) id say:

1. The Dark Knight
2. Inception
3. The Prestige
4. Oppenheimer
5. Memento
6. Interstellar
7. The Dark Knight Rises
8. Tenet
9. Batman Begins

its kinda hard to rank but oppenheimer might have nolans best score. this needs a rewatch forsure (also since my theaters 70mm projector broke so they refunded us and played the digitial film).  


side note: i always thought the internet's overhyping of a non-fictional story was a bit weird and people just overhyped it for no reason. i enjoyed it for what it was and how nolan crafted and executed the tone of these real events/people.

with that being said, i hope Nolan's next film (and future films) will mostly be fictional stories because I love his takes on sci-fi and reality bending stories. im already sad that Tarantino's last film is confirmed to be a non-fictional story again akin to Once Upon a Time. I thought Once Upon A Time was good but is not worthy of rewatching more than once other than for the final act/sequence. I also love Leo and Brad Pitt and felt like a fictional story would have been more interesting to watch for the duo.",2023-07-22 08:56:17
"Well, now I’m in an extensional crisis.",2023-07-22 09:29:05
"Nolan is really into that whole atmospheric ignition concept huh.  I guess it also shows how 'hypocritical' oppenheimer was (or maybe complex is the better word).  He knew it has the chance to end the world yet went with it anyway.  But somehow hydrogen bomb is too much.  
Hey I'm not judging.  I don't think Oppenheimer is guilty at all for creating a bomb tbh.  Just that he is a bit weird and always changing his views.",2023-07-22 14:30:26
"The Wind Rises is another film that I felt was similar to this.

Didn't like the stuff towards the end just after the test but as it progressed was as engrossed as I was at the start.

The first 30 minutes or so are absolutely magical.",2023-07-22 16:25:37
"Great movie imo, well paced with good dialogue, loved the effects work, music and sound was incredible, it did feel a little “lully” right after the detonation but it was probably just cuz I knew there was still an hour. (but the refreshing twist to political stuff kinda refreshed it a bit)

What was the last line Oppenheimer said tho about the math, I couldn’t make it out I only saw it on 70mm but the sound was overpowering the whole movie so I missed lines here and there.",2023-07-23 00:31:09

I’m somewhat amazed they did that. However, a lawsuit will happen rest assured. When are they going to put speakers and motors into theater chairs?
* It was basically two movies.  First movie: Assemble the team, build the gadget, test the gadget. Solid 8. Second movie: Oppy is on trial but not a trial to keep his Q clearance.  Too many characters, hard to follow.  But maybe I was tired.  6 but only adults.

I’d love to see Nolan do a film with a female lead - perhaps he would use Florence or Emily again?,2023-07-24 07:06:36
"I enjoyed the film. I saw another claim that the film ""holds your hand for the majority of its runtime"". While this is an exaggeration, there definitely are times that Nolan goes too far. He uses the ""briefly showing the same shot again to establish who this person is"" trick a couple of times unnecessarily.

The worst is the >!naked Jean writhing on Oppenheimer's lap!<, which caused snickering around me (not me, but I did want to groan). The later Oppenheimer >!in the bomber that Borden saw the V-2 rocket in, but now seeing multiple missiles!< makes sense from storytelling and thematic perspectives. His >!seeing people getting their skin melted off!< is so clichéd that it circles around and becomes almost (not quite, but almost) worthwhile using  (but maybe just once). >!Naked Jean making out with Oppenheimer during the hearing?!< Nolan is the cinematic genius and I'm a nobody, but I'll still tell him any day of the week that that just DOES NOT WORK, especially when >!Kitty is already glaring at him!<. Why not just have Oppenheimer >!wear a ""I'm incredibly ashamed and humiliated, in case you can't tell"" sign around his neck!<?",2023-07-25 06:12:30
"I know this is a stupid minor thing but can it be that Cillian Murphy actually never really smokes in the film? Towards the end of the film I noticed he‘s basically just only holding a cigarette or maybe stuck between his lips, but he‘s never actually smoking. I‘m asking because that would actually be a neat trick for an actor playing a chainsmoker without having to actually smoke (not even fake cigarettes).",2023-07-25 18:25:49
"Saw it last night and absolutely loved it.  Favourite film in years. I had quite an interest in the history so was already very invested. Music was unreal (listening to the score on repeat!) And the countdown sequence, god damn I nearly had a panic attack. Best cinematic experience in years especially in IMAX.",2023-07-28 11:15:52
"Man i really liked the film, i sitting around 7.5 to 8 out of 10, voted 8 since there is no half points in the poll.
The best scen is the build up to the Trinity Test with that music composed with Geiger Sensor as an instrument, it was awesome. The tension until the countdown to the test was amazing.
But the explosion itself was kinda disappointing, i feel he did not do a good job depicting the scale of the explosion, i was expecting more angles around the explosion showing more destruction and the scale of it all, felt like it was just a lot of zoomed in photos of fire, the actual Trinity Test footage looks way better (scale depiction).

I loved all the famous scientists depicted, i was giggling when each new one appeared after the other, i wish we saw more of them.

Seeing Teller already thinking about the H bomb while the other were thinking about the A Bomb was awesome too ""we just need a small A Bomb to trigger it"", loved that dialog.

I really liked the scene where they are calculating the possibilty of burning the whole atmosphere with an unstoppable reaction.

The famous Destroyer of Worlds quote being used during a sex scene felt weird, kinda lame. I also feel off on the start of the movie, way too fast paced jumping around timeline and showing a bomb right off the start kinda killed the suspense for me.

I wanted to see way more of the actual process of the bomb being built, i expected way more ""competence porn"" given Nolan loves his hard science (Interstellar). It would have been cool to see more of Heinsenberg too and some hints about the idea he intentionally sabotaged the bomb for the Nazis.

I expected to see the Demon Core accident depicted or at least mentioned.

But i understand the movie is called Oppenheimer and not ""The Bomb"" but still, you would expect the movie to focus more on his ""magnum opus"" and the actual process of building it.

Still really liked it overall but at the same time i too feel it could have been so much more.

EDIT:  Look at this, that i wanted to see that initial sun like plasma ball of fire depicted https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/TrinityFireballGif.gif in full scale. He actually used footage like that at the beginning of the film but not the actual test, i dont know why they did that.",2023-07-29 01:19:36

It's funny, because none of the wannabe critics here would have expected Michael Bay production out of The Theory of Everything or The Imitation Game, so why did they expect it here?

The film delivered. Yes, I think the Trinity Test section was a bit clumsy - the countdown was incredible 10/10, but the actual explosion hit the mark only about 7/10, and the courtroom act at the end felt a bit rushed. But this was still a great biopic.",2023-07-22 01:49:51

"I love the fact that Strauss's scenes were in black and white. His world and the way he sees it is black and white  (anyone that does anything to slight me must be my enemy, Einstein didn't look at me therefore he must be my enemy) so Nolan visualises Strauss's world view. Also, it helps the audience tell his scenes apart from Oppenheimers.

"I think I've come to the conclusion late stage Nolan isn't for me.

The Prestige will continue to be one of my favorite movies of all time and Dark Knight will continue to be my favorite superhero flick. But I just can't with modern Nolan.

I feel like his nonlinearly storytelling is at this point just smoke and mirrors to obscure a really simple plot. His treatment of women as objects that only exist as a memory is a pattern and not one I'm a fan of. Like Tenet, I felt like Oppenheimer was made to highlight a bunch of cool set pieces and special effects he'd rigged with little substance and a lot of noise.

I'm happy a lot of people loved it. I'm genuinely disappointed I didn't.",2023-07-26 02:20:09
"Not a big fan of Nolan's work in general. the movie had great moments, but overall the disjointed story telling was difficult to follow if you were not already somewhat familiar with Oppenheimer's story. My wife, who knew of Oppenheimer but not his story was lost a lot during the movie. This is also a typical Nolan approach that never works for me.

The opening sequence of Oppenheimer seeing the motions of atomic particles, etc was overblown and too long.  

The dialogue was cold and emotionless- really only a few moments with Damon's character brought any warmth to the movie.

Cyllian spent most of the movie walking around with wide eyes and a blank , haunted look in his eyes...otherwise not a wide ranging performance.

The nudity was unnecessary, as it usually is in mainstream movies, was just used for a shock moment during the security clearance hearing. 

The movie was swamped with loud sounds that overwhelmed too much of the dialogue. This was hampered by AMC theater having seen This is Spinal Tap Far too many times and thought that turning up the volume to 11 was better than 8..Much of the effects were just white noise.

Finally, I thought the actual moment of the test was disappointing...",2023-07-31 22:55:50
"I do not get what's so good about this movie.

It is just an average boring biopic. It felt like a crammed log of events from a biography or Wikipedia with not much developed themes. Personal doubts or dilemmas on communism or guilt from 'being used' or 'OMG what have I (we) done' come across as a comic book caricature

A few good cuts during the interrogation sequences ('feeling naked') are the only good directorial moves. The rest seems pretty nice filmed but pretty schematic and as expected. No drama anywhere. Trivial pop culture memes on physics and equally trivial particle animation...Whodunnit of academia backstabbing is ... boring. To me at least. 

Being betrayed by everyone would be dramatic if we had an idea of the main character's 'character', which we do not as he comes across as pensive but bland.

The story of Trinity, the Manhattan project, chasing Heisenberg and general quantum physics and progress vs. self-destruction conundrums are good material - maybe someone will make something out of it. The chilling and weird 'now I have become Death' quote is still better to watch in the original archive video. 

I don't know if anyone who does not know the cast of characters made of the most famous real-life physicist stars (Einstein, Heisenberg, Fermi, Feynman, Szilard, Teller, Bohr...) even has any grasp of what is going on in this story. 

A heavy bass soundtrack and excellent cinematography do not make a good movie. 

Cinema seems to have evolved into a stage where production techniques are perfected to nth degree. Technology advances so much that anyone can film a perfect-looking and sounding take, almost without effort.

However, ideas and script remain the most challenging bit in filmmaking - the parts where the brain and pen and paper are the required technology.

"Technically it's as good as it gets, but I think the screenplay was wrong. Basing this on the hearings is not a good idea, since the Manhattan Project gets sidelined and I have no interest about the political games against Oppenheimer. Furthermore the ending seemed completely pointless to me. Einstein's speech about everyone applauding Oppenheimer in the end being a selfish act didn't have much connection to the rest of the film, and the film tried to make it look like that was the whole point. It wasn't.

It's a technically good film based on an average screenplay, saying absolutely nothing about the man himself in the end.

Also Oppenheimer is not Einstein, he wasn't a leading physicist at any point, so why the movie tried to paint his early years like a physics genius is beyond me.",2023-07-26 06:06:24
"Maybe I'm just really slow, but I didn't know that RDJ was the antagonist until it was basically being rubbed on my face like, way later than I think I was supposed to acknowledge.

I felt it was very jumpy and the dialogue hints were too subtle or couldn't really understand. The beginning was especially confusing and was trying to find out which timeline I'm in by looking at Cillian or RDJ's hair loss in the first hour.",2023-07-22 07:27:37
"Fantastic film. Murphy and Downey should get Oscars, as should Nolan. I really liked the structure with the B&W parts about Strauss being interjected how they were.

And I never once had trouble following it.

Man, was it heavy. You can feel the knowledge of the destructive power he unleashed weighing on Murphy.",2023-07-22 20:58:26

"Im definitely looking forward to one of those videos  on YouTube where they perfect a scene from a movie. For Oppenheimer, it has to be the Trinity Test scene (the explosion itself in particular).

How profound, a morally corrupt politician vs a heart-eyed scientist. What could possibly be more important in this tale, aside the hundreds of thousands of people who lost their lives amidst this time.

The least important story that's ever been told to me, about the violent and heartless motions of a governing body. This movie communicates that heartlessness momentarily, before swiftly turning back to the flaws of American infrastructure. Groundbreaking. America is violence+power and water is wet, take notes y'all. Don't come to this movie to get away from the hotbed of modern politics, come here to see a three hour explanation of why the American people are paranoid, untrusting, and fearful. But come see it shown with no more wit to it than we see in modern broadcast news.

The buildup and surprise reveal (follow the music) of Emily Blunt being capable indicates that the audience should expect less of her. Since Nolan geniusly showed her as a struggling mother, alcoholic, and side piece of a genius, that's quite the moment. Wow, girl become capable. Florence Pugh is a muse but only seen peripherally. This three hour conversation between white Ivy League graduates definitely makes her ""importance"" quite clear.

Can't wait for two years from now when people can talk about this movie without parroting it's marketing. Would do just about anything to get these three hours back, but my regret and sorrow about my decisions does not a good story make.",2023-07-24 22:55:25

"Honestly this movie sucked.  So much talk, hard to understand who is playing what role. 3houes is way too long for a n All talk movie.  
I don’t watch movies for the director, so everyone here is saying this is another hit for the director, but that doesn’t apply since I don’t follow movies just based of directors.

Anyway so much talk that I fell asleep at 2:45 with minutes left.   The last hour the talking and up close face shots increased 3x and I was getting very anxious how much longer do people talking is going to go on for.  The sex scene he was imagining was pointless. What was the point of that?

I wish they gave you a context of when their was happening, because not everyone knows history well enough to know that the Japs got bombs when there was more talking in the movie.  I didn’t even realize this was happening at the same time.  Now if you know history that’s great but the movie should’ve presented the timeline of events better than having to have you do a WW2 cram session before you see the movie.  

No way Jose from me",2023-08-05 12:55:57
"It was fine. I'm not sure where all the hype for this movie came from. Nolan has become synonymous with event films, I guess. As I was watching it unfold, I kept thinking back to Paul Schrader's comments about this being ""the best, most important film of this century."" And I was like, no. It's just another biopic. It's well-made, it's well-acted, it's got some cool visual effects and a bombastic score, but it didn't do much for me on a personal level. Not a bad movie, but I thought the whole thing was overblown to be honest.

Oh yeah, and...

# FLORENCE PUGH HAS REALLY NICE BEWBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Whoooooooooooooooooo! That's been waiting to EXPLODE out of me for the past 6 hours! She's got nice titties, baby!!!!!!! YEAH!!!!!!!!

Remember when we were led to believe by the media that there was a two-hour full frontal scene in this film, where all the actors are just lounging around nude? Instead it was just two short intimate scenes completely blown out of proportion because people are so outraged by the human body nowadays. And honestly, all I kept thinking about after those scenes was that all I really care about are women's tits. I don't care about anything else. I don't care about atomic bombs, I don't care about Commies, I don't care about long, drawn out congressional hearings, or artistic uses of B&W and color, or Chris Nolan fanboys downvoting this post. Just tits.

Anyway, onto Barbie...",2023-07-21 09:00:23
"As I walked out of the theater after it ended, the only thing I really thought about was how much I will enjoy South Park ripping on it. The constant super epic music slowly picking up as a totally normal conversation is happening made me roll my eyes in the theater. It was just okay. As someone who is usually a fan of boring movies, I thought this was boring.",2023-07-26 23:29:02
"I went into this movie expecting to like it, and it is good but it's not perfect.

Pros-

-It is a gorgeous looking world. The set design, costumes of the Oppenheimer world are incredible it looks great. Easily the most impressive and best aspect of the film, but it also has great performances. 

-The performances were really good at conveying these characters that live in this Oppenheimer world. 

Cons-

-You have to accept the fact that this is basically a commercial. The informercial aspect of it is a little jarring, it does take you out of it.

-You have to accept that it's heavy handed commentary. It doesn't shy away from talking about nuclear capability. It does poke fun at nuclear capability, but it's not complete villification. It's just a tease. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. 

Verdict

If you can look past that, there's a lot to like here. It seems like we have a crowd pleaser. People in my showing I overheard thought it was ""So good,"" and ""they can't wait to see it again.",2023-07-22 03:27:32
"Is this comment thread comprised completely of people who love this kind of film? I feel like a lot of people in my theater were probably bored or let down by the film being a 3 hour dialogue heavy biopic. There's so much praise for this movie with little criticism when I feel like it was pretty stuffed with characters and dialogue that could've been trimmed to better serve the impact. Save for the trinity and speech scene, it was so heavy handed with exposition and dialogue in rooms. I feel like it's not a widely lovable movie and the Chris Nolan stamp and star studded cast just makes people attempt to appreciate it more. That's my hot take. I was excited to see it but bored actually watching it unfortunately.",2023-07-21 07:17:39
I don’t know if anyone else had this experience but this movie felt LONG to me. There were like five points where I thought the movie was ending because it felt like three hours already but wasn’t even close. Absolutely draining but in a good way? It was an amazing film but I have zero intentions of watching it again because it was so draining to me with the heaviness of the subject matter and intensity of the film itself.,2023-07-21 13:52:41

 Incredible moments sandwiched between thick slices of sleepytime bread.,2023-07-22 05:49:10
"Really suffered from '1917-syndrome' whereby it punctuates the film with exciting 'casting reveals' (casey affleck, rami malek, gary oldman) - totally takes me out the experience and makes all those characters hard to invest in.",2023-07-22 14:29:34
"My minor gripe with this film is that I really wanted to see the nuclear bomb itself. The Trinity Sequence was astounding for what it's supposed to do. But I was under the impression that Nolan was gonna show us the actual event that defined Oppenheimer & the world. Like immediately after the Final Dialogue with Einstein. An explosion that builds up on the Trinity Sequence in every conceivable way. 


That being said, someone needs to get Ludwig Göransson an Oscar for the score alone. Those Violin Orchestrations alone when building up a climax were just Phenomenal. Out of this world. I need to listen to those musical scores again. Hans Zimmer should be proud",2023-07-22 18:16:50
"
There's a moment in Oppenheimer where they write out the expected yield of the bombers being thousands to millions of tons and Oppenheimer literally says I'm not saying that... How about kilotons.

I KNOW WHAT THAT IS!!

>You're a dilettante, a womanizer, unstable, theatrical, neurotic.

Omg he's literally me.


I did not think the sex scene was weird even though apparently everyone else does and I'm now questioning various things.

The actual atomic bomb scene was some other worldly horror that literally froze the entire audience

The guy who invented the concept of an ICBM is portrayed as like a real psycho and creep, which I don't know if it's true, but it's kind of hilarious. He talks about watching v2's land on the city he was hiding out in and describes how he'd dreamed of putting an atomic bomb on top of one of those missiles.


Also, when you add in the neurosis the womanizing, the sort of underlying uncertainty over whether he's a horrendous criminal with a guilt complex or a good and noble man and the cool Cillian Murphy behavior. I think we've just got another literally me that people will be making YouTube edits of for years. That's gonna be weird.

https://youtu.be/mfms-Jtf2vg

I loved the subtle rumbling noises they had playing right as in the scene where they recreated the neutron capture and chain reaction at the accelerator, it's like That was the moment when the whole world subtly flipped and they realized, oh god, there's endless energy down there isn't there, and it's like your perspective flips and suddenly the entire world is rigged to explode if only you can find the right trigger",2023-07-23 09:26:10
"Very much enjoyed the first two acts, but the third act dragged on for too long.

That said, the performances were stunning, I loved the choice to go with silence for the test explosion (surreal experience in the theatre), some of the New Mexico landscapes were breathtaking and I thought the music was excellent.

I'm oscillating between a 7 and an 8 out of 10. The performances probably lift it to an 8, the third hour drags it down to a 7. Maybe a 7.5, I suppose.",2023-07-24 05:32:15
"Just saw it.

Was feeling numb for a couple of hours before I gathered my thoughts. 

I agreed with some of you guys here, that too much focus was on the trial/hearing. It pulled the pace  down drastically.  

I found the Los Alamos scenes more compelling, and I felt the film worked best when the other physicists were in the scenes together discussing the bomb.  

This might be an unpopular opinion but I found Cillian’s portrayal a little flat, whereas RDJ really shined and had much more emotional depth and range.  He is a definite for an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor.    

Regarding Cillian’s acting, maybe that’s how the real Oppenheimer was, more subdued and thoughtful. I’m not sure, I wanted to see more out of his range come out. 

Someone also commented they wanted to see the immediate fallout after the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I disagree because it would have taken away from the main movie storyline.  The whole thing about the aftermath of the bombs is an entire movie on its own altogether and putting it in this film would have majorly extended the 3 hour running time, or lost its focus. 

As a biopic, it’s refreshing to see it in a sea of summer action movies or superhero movies. We need more of these.

In closing, walking out of this movie, it really nails it home that if nothing, the atomic age reminds us that we’re all one bright flash away from extinction and honest to God, I hope no one on Earth will have to experience another atomic bombing.",2023-07-25 20:42:35
"This is a top two Christopher Nolan movie for me, and I have more or less seen almost all of his movies that he has directed.  I put this close to The Dark Knight (Batman 2), but it's hard to say which movie I like more.

I never knew Cillian Murphy had this type of acting in him. His was a decent actor in his past movies, but nothing at this level. This was Oscar quality acting from Cillian Murphy, although the Oscars are a long way off, so it's unknown what other movies and whatever leading male actor roles will pop up between now and the Oscars.  But for a typical Oscar year, I would nominate Cillian Murphy for an Oscar, IMHO. Every time Cillian Murphy was on screen, he was just a magnet. His outward demeanor was always calm, but when you looked at his eyes, you could feel he had chaos and turmoil inside his mind all the time.

And Robert Downie Jr was marvelous.  Haven't seen him in such a good performance for some time.  The acting, directing, story, music, everything was good. And I love how Christopher Nolan explores the themes and morality of nuclear weapons.  Tempted to watch this a second time.",2023-07-29 16:52:48
"Easily the best historic biopic I've ever seen.

I've seen Imitation Game, The Pianist, and this is in my opinion the best.  It had by far the best acting, cinematography, tension, editing (barring the usual Nolan dialogue issues but it wasn't bad for most of the film).  But the thing is that it is poignant as hell.  That ending is incredibly haunting.  And you know what's actually genius?  The entire time Strauss thinks that Oppenheimer insulted him to Einstein, and in a literal sense he didn't but if you think about what the message is he actually kind of did.

I love the Grey areas that the movie tackles and the hard truths that the characters try to ignore then deal with after the fact.

I think for me, as someone who's a huge physics nerd I would have liked more about the science behind the Trinity Test but that's minor.  And the Bomb scene i think could have been a bit better as well.

If Across the Spiderverse didn't come out this would be my movie of the year, but I've actually gotta settle on it.  Definitely #2 at least.",2023-07-21 06:02:13
"I loved it. Haven’t seen a film that masterful and powerful in ages. Oscar for Murphy. Can see nominations for Downey, Blunt, Nolan, Hoyte, Göransson, Sound, Costumes, Production Design, Editing, VFX. I already want to see it again, hopefully on IMAX this time.",2023-07-21 15:17:10

"People are talking about Florence Pugh, but I want to highlight Olivia Thirlby as lowkey hottest woman in this movie.",2023-07-21 21:12:16
"I was gripped for the first hour, then it fell into a lull for the second hour until the Trinity test. Once that hit, I was full in again, dealing with all the sadness of what Oppenheimer unleashed knowingly and unknowingly. 

I can’t say it’s Nolan’s masterpiece like some have put out there, it’s a very engaging story with some odd choices (the nudity struck me as unneeded in any scene it occurred in, particularly Kitty’s “vision”). 

Downey’s performance was a good way for him to stretch beyond Stark, Holmes, and (sigh) Dolittle, and he did extremely well with the complex part. 

I’ll see it again but don’t plan to do it in the theater.

ETA: I don’t have a problem with the lack of bomb shots with Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or even that there wasn’t enough focus on it. Oppenheimer didn’t see those events and it was pretty well tied to his PoV and some of Strauss’, so I didn’t need a zoom over to Japan bit. The horrors of it, imagined and seen after, were well reflected in what was in the film. The lull in the second hour was more just a bunch of tablesetting for the final round of reveals, which may or may not have been needed. 

And, honestly, without seeing it again, I’m not sure what Pugh’s character contributed in terms of the story we got: he dated her, left her, had an affair with her, and then died and it shook him for a bit but then just kinda stopped mattering once his wife told him to snap out of it; his wife knew of the affair but that didn’t seem to cause near as much tension as his unwillingness to fight the people trying to bring him down. If Pugh were excised from the film, I’m not sure what thematically would be lost since the rest of the film showed his mental state and possible martyr complex in other regards.",2023-07-21 21:33:07

"I believe this might be Nolan’s magnum opus.  I watched it early Sunday morning and i can’t stop thinking about it.  Many scenes have resonated, especially during the scene where everyones face is melting off in silence to a detonation.

Ludwig did phenomenal on scoring the whole film.  It almost gave me a slight blend of Dunkirk and Phantom Thread but much more haunting.

Knowing this is sourced from something that only happened less than 100 years ago makes it that much more haunting.  

I do agree with some commenters though.  I got some serious memento throwback.",2023-07-24 10:51:12

Cillian Murphy is outstanding. The blending of the pursuit of science, with the moral ambiguity, with the political smear campaign was so effortlessly assembled into one cohesive story is remarkable. I thought the movie would end at a certain point, and then it continued for another hour, which is usually not a good thing, but I couldn’t get enough and wanted to see more.

"Saw an 11:40am Barbie and a 2:50pm IMAX Laser Oppenheimer today. $6 and $12 a ticket for our local IMAX theaters deal day (not too bad). Here's what I got out of it: Push being played on the radio in Barbie when Ken takes over is hilarious. Florence Pugh is an amazing actress and boobs and IMAX sound is simply amazing, your seat will rattle solely from the wattage the speakers are all putting out many times during the film. First time I've ever experienced IMAX and will definitely experience it again once another film warrants it. Oppenheimer > Barbie

"Very prepared for the Nolan disciples to get upset at this, but here goes.

I'm 90mins into this thing and cannot fathom how it was even nominated for a single Academy Award let alone won any of them. 

- I've spent the entire film adjusting the volume. 
- There's been about 15 seconds of dialogue that wasn't accompanied/overridden by the insufferable score.
- Nolan's incapable of telling a coherent story and relies on these neverending cuts and time-shifts to create an artificial interest.
- The acting is about as ham fisted as a high school play.

I don't know if I should turn it off or keep watching just to see if it can actually get worse than it already is. If this was released 25 years ago people would've walked out of the premier after half an hour.",2024-04-08 11:47:07

I’m profoundly amazed that a 3 hour long R-Rated talky drama was a enthralling as it was… and that it’s drawing the audience it is.

I may be just biased because I'm a history buff but I can see nothing wrong with this movie. Also, people might have gotten confused if it was more focused on technical aspects of making the bomb (Read richard rhodes making of the atomic bomb for that) than the characters and what happened. The second half was part thriller too. 

So, this movie blew my expectations, it might be Nolan's best work yet.",2023-07-21 23:10:53
Didn’t know much about Oppenheimer before the movie besides his involvement in building the nuclear bomb so I was a bit taken aback by the heavy politics involved in the movie. Honestly thought it would be a movie simply about building the bomb and the war. The sound effects were great and the buildup before they detonated the bomb was my favorite part. The actual detonation was kinda anti climatic for me tbh. Also they didn’t show much about the war at all. The movie can also feel a little all over the place sometimes. Overall it was kinda meh…If I knew what this movie is like I’m not sure if I would go see it in the first place,2023-07-21 23:21:20
"It is an OK fillm.

I feel Nolan feels the need to mix up timelines because of Inception. 

It gives no time for character development. You leave thinking, why was everything in the first 1/3 shown? 

I watched a documentary (forget the name) before watching it. I was left wondering what the hell is going on. 

Nolan since Inception relates to nobody. I love him, I support him in his out of familiarity of cinema, but when it comes down to it.

I didn't even know what Oppenheimer himself felt about the H bomb. A man of complexity, such as Oppie, was endearing enough. Instead, we get a cut here, cut there, cut back to here, ""Nolan"" experience.

All in all, I am disappointed because I saw the potential in a character driven time period piece about a man coming to grips with the world he created through physics. 

This is a drawn-out, over elaborate, time continuum meltdown by a director that was let loose on brilliantly talented actors. 

I wouldn't watch it a second time, and I would refrain from asking a friend to watch it. 

Have a lovely day 🫠",2023-07-21 23:47:44
I found myself checking my watch in Barbie and didn’t check once in Oppenheimer. Fucking incredible pacing for a 3 hour movie about people talking. The tension Nolan is able to keep throughout the runtime is absolutely outstanding.,2023-07-22 04:39:23
"Well, where to begin?

I know that this movie is not going to be for everyone.  That there are many people looking for a summer blockbuster, that are going to be disappointed or, at the very least, stricken differently than they anticipated.

I am not one of those people.

I admit, I have only taken a casual interest in J. Robert Oppenheimer, until now.  When I first saw the trailers, I immediately knew it was something I wanted to *see*, but the *experience* of it has left me with so, so many thoughts.  

I wrote something as I left the theater, and I think it begins to encapsulate what I'm feeling, now.  

*War is started by people who feel, and then, inevitably, learn to think.*  
*War is ended by people who think, and then, inevitably, learn to feel.*

I expected *some form* of commentary on World War II, it's merits, and obviously, *did we need to drop any bombs, in the first place, much less two?*

What I got, instead, took that idea, and set it in the backseat, like a child spoken to by a parent.  ""War is the worst of conflicts, but by no means the only.""

I've always been a person that lives by the idea, to never rise at the expense of another, but that idea is grayed, when you cannot see the paths your choices will pave.  

""*We'll take it from here.*""

The *duality* in this movie is captured, beautifully.  Both, internally, of-self, externally, from those you both have influence on, with awareness, and those that you aren't aware of.  And trust, the bomb may be the *least* exemplary illustration of that in the whole movie.  Why do we make the choices we do?  Why *don't* we make the choices we don't?  How much control do we really have, to the course of our own life, when such feelings as vindictiveness, remorse, foresight, guide not only *our* hands, but the hands of *others,* for better or for worse?  

I found myself asking, beforehand, was Oppenheimer a hero, a villain, or somewhere in-between?  The latter proves to be where I stand, but I was carried there in waves of hindsight, anger, malaise - how is one to judge a life, except when most of that life is behind them, or, as we who sit in the theater, others who observe?  What motivations do we carry when we ask a question so contrived, and instead - by putting ourselves in certain shoes - arrive at an answer, more organically?  

Relationships erode.  Careers erode.  Fires are lit, and then doused.  We ask not for the rain, yet it falls.  We live, with wants, needs, desires, feelings, and over the course of our lives, they blend together in this concoction that manifests itself as regret, from certainly the choices that we've made, but moreover the choices that we didn't know we've made.   Until we, ourselves, become death, certainly the destroyer of one world, but - if we're unlucky - the destroyer of many.  

I walked out with so many ideas, so many thoughts, theories.  

But...theory will only get you so far.  

Verdict?  A work of brilliance, even if it is only left to the eye of the beholder.",2023-07-22 06:16:36
"I felt like the Trinity explosion was a let down, all the tension leading up to it was great but the actual blast could have been much better.

Also, I felt like they missed a trick by not showing the mushroom cloud hanging around in the background during the celebration scene. It would have worked perfectly to be in the background with the US flag when Oppie is lifting into the air.",2023-07-22 10:15:55
"Wow, just wow. It's difficult to articulate how successful this film was at portraying the dread and forboding nature of the subject matter. Somehow Nolan made a 3-hour, historical biopic that never dragged or slowed down. From it's beginning to the end, it was riverting, with each actor giving the best performances of their entire career. Easily one of his greatest films. 

I thought he also did a phenomenal job at encapsulating the feeling of anxiety - it's loud, claustrophobic and unrelenting. The final scene with Einstein and the scene in the auditorium will leave a lasting impression on me for years. Delighted to have witnessed this masterpiece.",2023-07-22 14:59:06
"I liked the movie, but I wasn't engrossed in it. Truth be told, I found it boring in a lot of parts.

Also, I feel like the non-linear format and like someone else said in this thread, the editing actually hurt it rather than help it. Also the third act wasn't necessary, that could have been cut down to about 10-15 minutes. For instance the Shocks of 1949 could have been told after building the bomb and not during the whole movie. And so could most of his trial. 

I hate to say this, but maybe Nolan wasn't the person for this movie. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is Nolan's first bipoic, and maybe it needed someone who's more familiar with that style of directing to take it to its final form.

On the other hand, Cillian Murphy was fantastic in this, so was Emily Blunt. And I appreciate that it was a look at Oppenheimer's whole life and not just the Manhattan Project.

However.... I do wish more focus was given to the Project and what life was like in Los Alamos.

Overall 8/10

Edit: Also the sound design, Jesus Christ Nolan get over yourself and get an actually good sound mixer",2023-07-22 18:17:26
"The movie was too loud. The best example of quiet whispers, loud explosions ever. This will be unwatchable at home. You will have to have your hand on the volume the entire time. You will wake up your neighbors or roommates. 1/10",2023-07-26 19:04:57
"Movie was a dud. Cutting between multiple timelines every 15 seconds for 3 hours didnt serve this movie well. I didnt care at all about any of the characters. Even the bomb explosion was a dud....very anticlimactic. Looked way better in the intro of the movie than it did at the big moment. The actors gave it their all, though. Stellar performances let down by directing/editing. I went in understanding and prepared for a biopic that doesnt have much ""spectacle"". I was ready for that, but it still didn't deliver. 

Oh well, will still look forward to Nolan's next project.

Side Note: Dolby Atmos theater was definitely the right move. Really glad I didnt road trip to see it in 70mm Imax.",2023-07-27 04:38:42
"I disliked the movie, although I'm encouraged now to study more about this time period on my own. I did learn about Oppenheimer but the larger effort of the bomb itself as well as the manhattan project was confusing.

From what I gather, the movie structure involved three different segments: Oppenheimer's life, his work on the manhattan project, and the political problems before and after ww2 with his communist relationships. They jump from one segment to another which is a style that I haven't enjoyed that much in a movie except, ironically, with The Prestige, another Nolan movie. However, I think The Prestige was easier to follow because it focuses on the two magicians, but rarely at the same time. So when it switches from Angier, you get Borden and vice versa. In Oppenheimer, it jumps all the way around and becomes murkier in the political scenes involving Straus. Maybe they should've let those out considering Straus was the focus for the last chunk of the movie anyway.

Some other random thoughts. I wished that they showed more effort of building Los Alamos as well as the manhattan project in general. I wanted to see some epic montages of big machines and scientists puzzling over math problems. I wanted to see some effort and struggle. Instead, the bomb merely appears when the movie decides that it's ready. The soundtrack was amazing but totally wasted. I listened to some of the soundtrack a week before I saw the movie and my favorite track so far is Fusion. In my head, I could imagine this music playing while some epic graphic shows atoms breaking and neutrons flying around while the scientists struggle getting certain problems worked out. But in the movie? This track plays while characters have conversations. What the hell? That's a total waste. When the bomb finally makes its appearance it feels way to easy. They missed a huge opportunity to build some excitement here. Sure, it might've been a little Hollywood and not realistic but come on. Give me some entertainment.

In the lead up to my viewing, I also felt some disappointment that I couldn't experience ""the real"" movie in its 70 mm Imax epicness. But while I watched the movie at my local plebe theater I kept thinking, ""How the hell is this an Imax movie?"" 95% of the movie involves indoor scenes. What benefit does Imax give you? It's odd that they made such a big deal about that.",2023-07-30 04:40:35
"The 2nd act was awesome, them showing how they are building the bomb and the struggles going along with it, the explosion itself and lack of sound all that I loved. After the explosion it completely took me out of the movie. What the hell do I care if Oppy gets his security clearance back? Who the hell is Strauss? They give no details of his background, who he is, it was such a reach trying to turn that into a thing. And then the huge buildup of what Oppy said to Einstein...basically nuclear bombs are going to end humanity. It's been 80 years and that hasn't happened so I don't understand the shock or the people claiming ""wow what a gripping ending and thought that was"". What? You didn't think before nuclear bombs could end humanity?",2023-08-02 20:34:44
So many criticism I see here are just some minor nitpicks. I remember Interstellar getting this kind of gripes but is now considered his best work. Nolan movies usually needs to be watched again to appreciate it more. I see it no exception with this one too. The truth is this is one of the best movies to come out of in the last few years. Way better than most of the crap big studios are now releasing. This will be a cult classic in few years time l.,2023-08-08 05:14:57
"Shouldn't have it been better if Nolan also use actually Trinity footage?

I actually love the quantum demonstration and the Trinity explosion close up shot Christopher Nolan made in his movie. But the wide shot is to me just under expectation. Shouldn'd it be more powerful, more impactful and more ground-shaking?

I thought he could have done a better recreation, or maybe even used a bit of mixing between the recreation and real footage.

In Dr. Strangelove and How I learn to love the bomb, Stanley Kubrick actually used real nuclear bomb drop footage (not the Trinity but other drop) and it has impressed me ever since.

Is it just me or...?",2023-08-13 02:55:43
So what’s everyone’s thoughts on which was the worst  unnecessary Nolan name drop - JFK in this or Robin in Rises?,2023-08-13 09:43:16

"I loved the first 2/3, the last 1/3 was an eternity and I got bored at points. The editing got more frantic as it bounced between the flashback and framework narratives, and got messy near the final panel. 

Overall I liked it. But it was just too oddly paced in the end. 8/10 overall because outside of the editing/runtime issue it was basically perfectly executed. I just didn’t really love it and/or enjoy myself to give it higher.",2023-07-21 13:25:28
"It was a great movie, but the same gripes I have with almost all of Nolan's films reappear once again. 

I swear, this dude cannot mix dialogue audio worth anything! I couldn't catch a third of it because it was so quiet and I needed subtitles already with a lot of things, but this movie took the cake. My man, make that dialogue more pronounced of something!!

There were so many characters running in and out that I couldn't remember them all. When they started revealing twists (like who the spy was, who sent the folder), I was like ""... Oh, who... Uh, who was that guy again?"" My boyfriend and I had to talk about it on the way home because we both missed something or forgot someone and had to ask the other who tf that was. 

This was essentially a courtroom drama and political espionage when it should have been focused more on the bomb and Oppenheimer's aftermath guilt. I did learn a lot, but I also expected the second half to be angsty emo Oppenheimer and not angsty self obsessed Strauss. 

Nolan could have cut an hour and narrowed it down a lot. It would have markedly improved the film. But it was a great film and superior acting.",2023-07-21 15:13:07
"Hopefully this is a turning point for Nolan.

Obviously he's an amazing filmmaker, but let's be honest, he's become a parody of himself in recent years, much like Shamalayan. Falling too deep into the ""I have to mess with time"" concept, incomprehensible audio remixes that he claims are intentional, generally hurting the accessibility of the stories he's trying to tell.

Here, we have a movie where I can actually make out all the dialogue, a score that's constantly present but doesn't interfere with my ability to understand what is happening or miss crucial exposition, a movie with just enough time manipulation to service the telling of the story, but not drive the story itself (unlike Tenet, the story isn't about time; there's no in-universe gimmick).

I don't know if it was Universal stepping in over Warner Brothers, or the fact that this is a biopic rather than a fictional story, but it's wonderful to have  the craft of Nolan but with all his excessiveness pared back.",2023-07-21 16:49:19
"I don't think I fully understood what was going on. I got confused by all the white men's names and who was trustworthy and who was prosecuting who. I understood the bomb going off, and the sciencey stuff in the beginning was okay. Plus Albert Einstein had some cute moments. But golly I couldn't tell you what was the significance of the fat man who fed Oppenheimer bread on the train or what were the repurcussions of the Brit guy in the team being a Soviet spy. I need to do some homework to understand this thing.",2023-07-21 21:58:07
"Cillian Murphy did a great job playing Oppenheimer, I also enjoyed Matt Damon’s scenes. I agree that the trinity test wasn’t that impressive, Nolan maybe could’ve tried to use actual footage of the test instead. sex scenes aren’t needed. All they really needed to show was when he met Jean, going back to meet her in Chicago then her suicide and how it effected Oppenheimer IMO. The dialogue is hard to hear but maybe it’s better in 70mm, idk. I guess I wanted to see more of Oppenheimer himself working on the bomb, leading his team, going thru the different ideas they had, the stress he was under to finish before the Germans, almost quitting (I believe he wanted to), and believing he they couldn’t do it at first. I didn’t feel they showed enough of his depression and regret afterward, it was said he would be walking around muttering things but I don’t think we got any of that even tho it was three hours. Overall I’ll give it a 5.5/10. I think maybe it would’ve been better as a mini series.",2023-07-22 15:45:04
"I love Nolan and I thought Oppenheimer was terrible. What was the point of all the hype that you have to see it in IMAX when half of the movie is in a room with people talking? I love going to see movies in IMAX, but I felt like I could have watched this at home and gotten the same experience. The only good part of the movie for me was the 20 minutes testing the bomb and even that was just okay. The constant musical score in the background of every piece of dialogue was so overused and annoying like some grand reveal was going to happen every second of the movie. Jumping between timelines made it hard to follow and I had zero emotional connection with any character. The entire movie felt like watching a trailer with random clips stitched together and music. I'd rate it a 4/10 and I would never want to watch it again. Reading reviews of people that loved it makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills and watched an entirely different movie.",2023-07-23 04:56:09
"I like biopics but Nolan’s moviemaking skills don’t suit the genre. So many cinematic and musical crescendos that build to half-hearted reveals. I hear a lot is made of the how visually stunning this movie is which is misleading and betrays the fact that this movie is 90% actors talking in conference rooms- not that this is a bad thing but the visual-cinema muscles of Nolan and co are only really flexed once or twice in the film. Don’t go into the movie expecting jaw dropping effects, it’s far more understated as a whole. The movie should’ve ended after the speech Oppy gives after the successful bomb test at Trinity, the court drama that ensues really overstays it’s welcome. 6.5/10. Overcooked and oversold imo.",2023-07-23 21:45:38
"Man, the bomb test disappointed me so bad that I spent the rest of the film wondering if that was a red herring. Like they’d come back to it as if the first go was actually a smaller version of the test that they they imagined it would be. Didn’t want entertainment from this, I wanted a couple generations to get a healthy dose of fear. This film almost does the opposite. Yes, the dialogue is good enough to achieve the same, but only for people with attention spans and enough intelligence / thoughtfulness to fully grasp the grave nature of the atomic age. Moot point because those types likely already get it. Never thought I’d say this but I wish he went partly CGI with it. And left the sound on, WTH. That decision made sense and was very effective in Interstellar. It just sucked all the impact out of the scene here. Even the aftershock just looked like a few high powered fans flicked on for a second. It made nukes look not so bad. I thought he’d show glimpses of his practical explosion but rely on a long stream of closeups similar to the snippets shown throughout the trailer and beginning of the film. He made an absolutely phenomenal biopic. It’s just disappointing to have that scene botched. The nudity too was a giant miss for me, and I’m no prude at all. Why make a film like this less accessible in any fashion?",2023-07-24 03:16:42
"My dear Nolan, give the scene some breathing time to fully grasp the context and weight of the event.

The fast paced editing and jumping from scene to scene and timeline look stylish, keeps on edge of seat tbh but there are some scenes that require context especially for non-US audiences.",2023-07-24 05:06:54

"Honestly, I did not like it. And I wanted to. I thought they focused too much on his personal life and not enough on the bomb/war. There was no action at all. We never really see the devastation that bomb caused. I just couldn’t believe the highlight of the whole film was the testing of the bomb. They don’t even show anything about the aftermath of Nagasaki or Hiroshima. Your average person seeing this movie if they aren’t into history, they might still not even know the devastation it inflicted on people for months and years after it dropped. A couple of lines and one image of a woman (in his mind) having her skin melt off is all you see.

I was so bored in the last 45 minutes I couldn’t wait for it to be over. And I’m a history buff who loves Nolan. This movie did nothing for me and I was very disappointed. It was the first movie I saw in theaters this year.

Also the scene where naked Florence pugh straddles him while he reads the ‘I am become death’ line was so cringey my eyes rolled out of my head",2023-07-25 14:08:11
"Emily Blunt wasn't in it much but she (and Kitty in real life) had the best scene in the whole movie. She better at least be nominated for best actress.

"Acting, great. Script writing? Typical Nolan for better or worse.  


Special effects? Fantastic.  


Editing? ADHD, and jarring. Scene Length? 5 seconds per scene tops.  


Honestly, I would rather have just watched a couple of Oppenheimer documentaries instead. Maybe a double feature with a Manhattan Project focused doc followed by an Oppenheimer specific focused documentary.   


Like Inception, this one just didn't do it for me.",2023-07-27 22:11:55

"This film is an absolute triumph. Cillian Murphy, gave one of the most haunting and perfect performances I’ve ever seen. This film truly portrayed the human toll and terrifying consequences that sometimes accompany human innovation. The ending scene, that final conversation with Einstein left me speechless. 
This film is completely worthy of sweeping everything at the Oscars, and it should. It is my opinion that this movie told Oppenheimer story on such a scale, that his story should never be told again after this. Nolan crafted the greatest version of his story that can be told.",2023-07-22 03:49:02
"I loved every aspect of the  movie, except, if I had to be really nitpicky, the fact that I knew the explosion was practical felt like it reduced my enjoyment of it somehow. I realised that it was some drums  of gasoline exploding that Nolan shot  cleverly to make it seem bigger. It was genius from a film making perspective but maybe I would have liked finding that out after the movie was released.  But I was unable to as this was the one thing that dominated my social media feed,as the amount of the number of shitposts about Nolan detonating an actual nuke was insanely high.

Also, >!the final scene was totally CGI, where Oppenheimer was dreaming about the end of the world.!<",2023-07-22 15:56:10
"absolutely fucking dreadful. dreadful, and anxiety inducing, and devastating, but a film for the ages. i think this is nolan's magnum opus. the trinity test scene left my heart racing; the absolute decimation that surrounded this bomb, but yet the beauty of seeing what you created be possible. in a weird way, the movie reminded me of mary shelley’s frankenstein, with oppenheimer being victor and the bomb being the creature or even with the roles reversed tbh. an overarching theme of frankstein is loneliness, and oppenheimer is burdened with the knowledge of what he has created and what implications it has for the rest of time; “Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him; but i am solitary and abhorred”.

oppenheimer was extremely smart who seeked knowledge, but at what point does the knowledge become deadly? he was a man ruled by ego, and he never intended for this bomb to be a weapon of mass destruction, but that does not negate the responsibility he must take for creating a weapon like this. I found the scene where they’re picking what Japanese city to bomb to be the most jarring; saying that he crossed off Kyoto because it’s a culturally important city, and because him and wife vacationed there; the contrast of the absolute decimation that the bombs caused, over the casual tone of them picking a city that would be best to bomb.

A visually stunning film, with all of nolan's directing choices adding on the film than taking away from it. Probably wouldn’t watch again for a hot minute, because it was draining in the best way, but easily a 4.7/5 for me.",2023-07-22 23:07:38

"Watching this at 10PM was a mistake, when you incorporate how bad the sound mixing was and the movie all dialogue.. last hour was hard to get through, found myself almost falling asleep even though I tried my hardest to focus. The speed of the dialogue and how it jumps from scenes to scene was hard to follow. The pacing felt completely off to me 

I think I need to watch it one more time at home with subtitles to really digest this movie properly",2023-07-23 14:57:34
"I found this boring and pretentious. With the way the film was shot (endless dialogue scenes of exposition and witty remarks and ‘intelligent’ conversation while the camera slowly zooms in the person talking as the music swells) it felt like a 3 hour long trailer.

The film also felt very cramped. Both in the speed of the pacing and in the composition of the shots. This is partly due to the nature of the film (being that it is mainly comprised of characters talking to each other) but there were hardly any interesting or visually exciting shots.

This may be my own personal taste but I just felt like there was something off about the dialogue. Everything seemed too perfect, characters could always come up with the snarkiest, wittiest thing to say to whoever was antagonising them, to me it felt like a ‘high art’ Marvel movie.

The bomb test was incredibly overhyped as well. It did not at all look like a convincing nuclear explosion and again, the camera was so zoomed in for most of the explosion and the focus was too heavily put on the characters reactions that I hardly even felt a sense of scale or grandiose but, again, this may be due to my own personal taste.

Also, the film’s big moments, for example the bomb test, Rami Malek’s character exposing Strauss did not feel earned. Despite its long runtime, the film felt rushed and therefore I felt as if these moments didn’t hit as hard as they should have.

My only real positives of the film was that the acting was, on the whole, superb and (despite my criticisms of the cinematography) it certainly looked better than the majority of films coming out recently.

Overall, I would recommend it to someone who is a fan of Nolan and this genre as I feel like it is a film you should probably see. However, I do not think I will be rewatching it any time soon.",2023-07-25 10:33:12

I honestly think it is unbelievable how much of a masterpiece Nolan has made this latest project. 

I saw it in the IMAX a few days ago and I'm still thinking about it days later. From the score, to the actors, to the cinematography, to the overall way it was shot… Just absolutely incredible, definitely one of Nolan's finest projects to date..

Just to give you an idea of what the atmosphere in my screening was like, you could literally feel every single emotion in the audience throughout every single scene and I don't think I've experienced something like that in a very long time it. Just shows you the beauty of Christopher Nolan and his ability to project such a beautiful vision for us all to see, what a time to be alive.",2023-07-27 23:34:40

"This brings to mind the story from the *Krishna's Kino* about the Princess who gazed upon Christopher Nolan as he readied himself to write a woman; he spoke, “You are become death, destroyer of my worlds.” *(Yeah I know she died in real life, don't @ me).*

There were 2 good movies here and 1 really awful one. Couldn't stand how goofy the first forty minutes were, young Oppie traveling the world, never committing to anything. Pugh and Blunt had zero to do, the one scene where Blunt finds him in the woods was weak, nothing could breathe in this movie that jumped between so many tones with no through line.

I really felt Cillian got lost in the noise, albeit with some great scenes (mostly just the silent speech he gives with the baby cry in the background, brutal).

Benny Safdie proves again he's the greatest actor in Hollywood. Edward Teller stole the movie for me. I bet he loved putting on oily sunscreen and sunglasses and staring into the darkness.

Also shout-out to the dozen people that checked their phones every 30 seconds, recorded the entire Trinity sequence, and had us hear text alerts every 10 minutes. They didn’t deserve the 70mm print we got. Film is dead, not even Nolan can make an excellent movie anymore (I was hoping *Tenet* was a fluke).

EDIT: Also did everyone die from cancer/radiation poisoning? I saw *Chernobyl* and that was a lot of graphite.",2023-07-21 08:02:37
overrated for me,2023-07-21 13:16:55
"It’s great but it’s too long and had no business being in imax. It was essentially a courtroom drama. I don’t see why it cost 100m either (sure ok the cast, I must have a massively underestimated idea of what actors earn, I thought $10m for a lead was pretty good, but apparently it’s a ridiculously tiny amount.. )

Now that I’m on the bus home I’ll give some more thoughts. 

I loved the score, very abrasive and thumpy and kinetic. Cillian Murphy was excellent. I feel like Robert Downy Jr and Stanley Tucci could play brothers. The explosion was fine, a little bit underwhelming though given the amount of press behind it. The lack of CGI was welcome if obvious - the abstract use of miniatures (or whatever practical element it was) looked ok but seemed oddly out of place at times. I found Florence Pugh being naked for basically every scene very jarring and totally unnecessary - despite being happy about it. 

Overall, I think it was very good - I didn’t enjoy it as much as I was hoping, it feels shitty to say it was a 7/10 - it *feels* like a 10/10 but the length was uncomfortable and after the 2 hour mark I did start to feel a little impatient, so I struggle to give it a higher rating even if basically everything was essentially perfectly executed.",2023-07-21 15:04:39

"I thought this movie was fine, but plagued by the classic Christopher Nolan downfalls. Couldn’t care less about the characters, and the dialogue is choppy and unnatural. Not much heart to the movie.

[deleted],2023-07-22 01:35:49
"It’s a good movie. It’s 30min to an hour too long. You could argue that there is no reason for Robert Downey Jr to be in the movie but to setup the last scene. That last scene is tremendous, but if the whole movie was setup for the last scene then what was like half the movie? 

Florence Pugh is great, has like 5 lines, but loooks great except that one scene which was why that even crosses a persons mind? 

I think Nolan got stuck with Robert Downey Jr and couldn’t get him to the NV set or film with a lot of other actors so he had to set up the whole movie around that real life problem. 

RDJ is good, but he sucks the point out of the movie. What is the movie named? 

I feel like there was a lot of other big names in this movie as cameos that I wasn’t  expecting. But I don’t think they took away from the story overall.

Framing the movie that way, telling Oppenheimer’s story that way…. Why?",2023-07-22 05:31:49
God Florence Pugh has great tits.,2023-07-22 07:28:13
"Big time Nolan fan, interstellar and dark knight are probably my most watched movies but this.. this was disappointing and boring.

I was hoping for some ominous B29 heading to Japan scenes Dunkirk style, we get none of that.

Also we don’t get the true scale of power of the bomb most unaware people will think  it’s just a big bomb equivalent to 20000 tons of TNT with no reference.

They quickly mention radioactivity but not much, they should have shown the true atrocities of what that bomb did and how it also impacts nature etc, the women having her face melting while clapping looked like some cheap plastic tape  makeup, I’ve seen it done better on tv shows with less budget.

The trinity test was very underwhelming it looks like a barrel of gasoline explosion with black smoke. Go check the real remastered video on YouTube to see what it really looked like and how scary it is.

I think they really should have used the R rating to show more aftermath instead of Florence Pugh titties which were unnecessary for the plot but I guess good eye candy for the audience. Otherwise they easily could have avoided that and just get a PG13 rating for more ticket sales.

The movie focused more on his security clearance and Downey Jr Strauss character. Would have been better if they explained nuclear fission in detail and more physics and Einstein stuff. 

At some point you got some dialogue back and forth with black white imagery and you get quick cuts of the bomb being built like a puzzle by dropping the pieces in place. 

Also movie has some unnecessary jumpscares.

But the acting was excellent and the charisma of the actors kept me listening but still disappointed as the movie felt too long while focusing on issues that weren’t really interesting",2023-07-22 13:43:07
"The movie was fine overall, but I was pretty disappointed with it. I understand the significance of the material, but it was still long still and boring. There's no reason for it to be over 3 hours or in imax. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people unless they are history buffs.

Watching Oppenheimer is like watching a 3h trailer of Oppenheimer.",2023-07-22 14:34:00
"The amount of people who are upset that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki aren't in the film is asinine. The film is much better off not including them - it's completely irrelevant to show that.

Go get off to more mid marvel films if you want your nonstop meh action sequences.

"A bit ago I watched that Elvis movie. That movie was so choppy, and not a single scene lasted for more than 45 seconds. They were trying to compact 40 years into three hours.

Oppenheimer is essentially doing the same thing, and because of that, it was super choppy and disjointing. Since Nolan likes to needlessly befuddle the timelines around, it made even more so choppy and disjointing. You have some of the greatest actors in modern cinema and you’re just going to have them repeat lines? You’re not going to let them stew on a scene and play into it for a few minutes? 

I wanted this movie to be about the race to make the bomb, including the politics of whether or not they should devote the resources, the testing of the bomb, and the moral ramifications of what Oppenheimer did. He was trying to save the world and instead he might’ve doomed it. That is an excellent movie. We did not get that movie.

The bomb explosion occurred two hours into the movie, meaning there was a whole hour left. Taking into account that a lot of that first two hours was actually post Hiroshima and Nagasaki, less than half of the movie was a movie I wanted to see. Instead we got this whole communist spy American loyalty court drama, and I did not want that. Was it good? It could have been, if it was edited by someone who’s seen a movie before, and the music volume was cut down by half. I couldn’t hear perhaps a fifth of the dialogue, and the only reason it was that low is because I’ve read a book about Oppenheimer and I was able to guess what the actors were saying for half the movie. 

Nolan makes movies that should be good on paper, but in execution that fall short of what they promise. I expected a great film. I got an okay one instead. If it was edited so it was less choppy and the music was quieter, I could say it was good.",2023-07-23 07:15:28
"Without going into too much detail , i was disappointed. This was not the block buster that I thought I was going to get.",2023-07-23 11:20:54
"Best I can say about this movie is that, even though it was 3 hours long, it didn’t feel a minute over 4.

Seriously, I’ve never seen something that felt both so overstuffed and excruciatingly long",2023-07-23 15:04:16
"After making the rounds through all the socials I can definitely say that Oppenheimer would not have done as well without Barbie. Barbie gave this movie a big boost. 

My little siblings who would never have cared for this went to go see it. Anecdotal, but 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷",2023-07-23 19:54:58
"I thought it was really boring. It felt like Nolan made this movie exclusively for people who already have a solid grasp of the events depicted in the film. For someone with minimal background knowledge on the story, the nonlinear storytelling and often unintelligible dialogue made this film very hard to follow.",2023-07-23 23:48:56
"Didn't understand half of it. Was Robert Downey Jr a bad man?. I also thought the bomb was lackluster and thought there was no need for any of the sex scenes. No mention of Ernest Rutherford. And the music was too loud, maybe I'm just old haha . Kinda disappointed 6/10",2023-07-24 05:46:44
That explosion was really fucking underwhelming even in Imax...,2023-07-24 22:12:25
"If it weren't for my 3 buddies I would've left the theater. Even with the good performances, the tedious and dull court room hearings were painfully boring.
 
I wasn't expecting a spectacle filled blockbuster but I was expecting something engaging and gripping. This was the most boring experience I've had at the movies in a while. 

Chris Nolan peaked at inception for me and each subsequent film of his has let me down more and more.

 I'm glad a drama like this is doing so well because it's great for big movies to have variety and not all be cgi popcorn fests. With that being said, I have no desire to revisit Oppenheimer. I wanted to love this movie, unfortunately i was greatly disappointed",2023-07-27 07:15:42
"I really don't get the praise for this. The first third was paced like scrolling through tiktok, second third got a little interesting (but the test was disappointing), the last third is when I felt more invested and interested. 

I haven't read the book (and I am definitely no Nolan), but had the thought that centering the story telling around the clearance hearing and flashing back through different questions would might have solved the pacing.",2023-07-27 16:21:38
"The story was very difficult to follow. It is interesting in itself, but it is told in a confusing manner, jumping from one year to the other with no way to distinguish what is happening when. There isn't even a change in the protagonist's appearance.

The fact that so many people don't acknowdlege this makes me hate the movie even more",2023-07-31 22:33:14
I waited for over a month to watch this movie on an IMAX screen at perfect seating position. I felt this movie didn’t need IMAX screen as it had 90 percent of closeups and only few grand shots. This would be the only nolan movie which I wouldn’t be watching again. I felt nudity was unnecessary which didn’t add any value to the plot or performance showing Nolan has decided to pivot from his usual way of film making. He was successful in showing that people and politics are more complex and powerful than Quantum Mechanics.,2023-08-21 01:55:38
"I don't understand people saying that they didn't know who was who when watching the movie and then reviewing it based on that. It's not a documentary where you learn about that stuff. It's a movie based on a 700+ pages biopic, so it was clear that you have to have somewhat of a knowledge about some people going into the movie. It's not the movie's fault if people don't know who certain characters are.",2023-07-21 11:16:24
Awful. Terrible. Worst film I've seen with a 100 million budget in a long time.,2023-07-22 18:04:53
"I paid extra to see this in IMAX and sit in less comfortable chairs for 3 hours and all I got was one lousy test explosion. Seriously underwhelming. Great acting and was surprised they managed to keep up the pace but it's just long and boring and it can't make up for it. Feel bad for bringing my girlfriend to see this lmao seriously. And the music would build to very loud levels for seemingly no reason when very little it happening on screen, it was over done.",2023-07-30 06:46:12
"The movie was great overall, I was just a bit underwhelmed by the trinity test explosion. 

It felt like they detonated a bag of gasoline.

And the fucking was a little too Hollywood, unnecessary. 

And it focused too much of the accusations part instead of the excitement of physics, science, discovery etc. In this regard, _interstelar_ was a bit better.

They focused a little too much on trials, his fence hopping shite... give me the deep need shit, the labs, the people refining uranium, I didn't come in to see Florence Pugh's parts...

I expected more, especially after such hyping and of course, Interstelar. 
But worth watching and better than that Barbie crap",2023-08-09 21:43:41
"Maybe I missed the point, but I found the writing and acting in the film too dramatic/ over played for the historical context of the movie. Too much of a focus on Oppenheimer having an affair, too many big names cast in the movie (I could not disassociate Rodrick from that one actor that played him in Diary of a Wimpy Kid and post the scene where Oppenhemier walks outside and this actor is puking on the lawn or whatever, also Josh from Drake and Josh hitting the detonation button…) just made the whole film feel way too cheesy in relation to the context. Borderline offensive not gonna lie and I usually don’t care. Went in kind of expecting to feel something bigger and kept asking myself throughout the entire movie “This film is about the bombs that incinerated Japanese people on impact right?” Felt weird leaving the theater. Wouldn’t go see again.",2023-08-26 19:04:09
I expected a lot more honestly. It was a good movie yes but imo it was too sensational and glorified than a movie about the atom bomb needed to be. Also very long with very little substance,2023-07-21 18:27:40
So many character without proper [intro.](https://intro.so)hard to invest any characters .oppenheimer portrayed as non emotional and suddenly he becomes felt fear and guilt .i am lost mid way and no feelings towards any of the characters .and the non linear fashion anybody explain them to me,2023-07-21 19:19:10
Very average,2023-07-22 01:20:07
"I just saw it about an hour ago, and I have to say I have some complaints.

1. The trailers need to do the movie justice. The trailers lead the viewers into believing that it's going to be a movie about only building the bomb, and not about Oppenheimer's full life story. Honestly, I thought this too, and going into the movie, I kept asking myself if this was really the movie.
2. The movie seems really hard to follow, when one arc or plot line is about to reach its climax, it seems to jump to something else. It almost felt like you had to read a biography on Oppenheimer's life before watching the movie even to understand what was happening. And in the scene where Oppenheimer is being followed by what I think was the FBI, he goes and has sex for no reason at all. I thought there would be some crazy standoff between these two men, with greatly differing social and political views, but no! he goes and has sex! and I do understand it's about his life, but cmon! 
3. The build-up was not worth the payoff. Christopher Nolan spends two and a half hours of build-up to what was supposed to be (and advertised like!) the big finale of the movie, only to show a 20-second clip of a bomb that honestly, wasn't that spectacular.
4. This whole idea of Oppenheimer struggling with stress is, in my opinion, pretty well portrayed, through the stomping feet that lead up to a pretty half-assed speech, but in some cases feels over-done and not needed in certain scenes. 
5. The sex scenes are just stupid, like when Oppenheimer whispers ""destroyer of worlds"" while having sex. Like.. wtf?? also there's a whole scene with them chilling naked, which seemed unneeded. 

All in all though, I didn't think the movie was that bad if you're going in with the intent of being a biopic about Oppenheimer's life! But if you think it's going to be a movie fully about the creation of the atomic bomb, think again cause this is not what it is.",2023-07-22 03:55:02
"Boring and hard to keep up with since it kept switching around past / present / future. I can see what he was going for. But I literally fell asleep towards the end of the movie.

The bomb and scenes were really dope though!",2023-07-22 07:07:52
"I must be in the complete minority but I thought the film was terrible. Actors were great and the score was beautiful but it was so so boring. We left the cinema with over an hour to go. 

It’s a fascinating story but there was no need for that to be 3 hours. It felt like it just kept building into nothing.",2023-07-22 08:44:01
"I liked the movie, but man that bomb was such a disappointment!",2023-07-22 12:15:07
Was anyone else bothered by how basically no one talks like it's the 40s? All the dialogue sounded completely modern to me.,2023-07-22 16:06:19
"I'm easily impressed but this movie was a let down. Really bad pacing. Unnecessary black and white. Skipped over the physics, glossed over physicists. Didn't make the politics interesting or engrossing or captivating. Uninteresting twist. 3 hours long.",2023-07-22 21:11:46
Boring. This is what happens when 1hr documentary is made into 3hr movie.,2023-07-23 08:47:31
"I left cinema kinda not satisfied. From trailer I simply expected different kind of movie, this was more something like political drama which is not what i expected from the trailer...

I know people liked it, but since I am big fan of atomic energy and atomic/hydrogen bombs I know almost any atomic test footage that there is... The conventional explosion they used for their practical effects sadly didn't do it justice for me... It was too obvious that its not atomic explosion for me - atomic explosion doesn't look like napalm fire ffs! I wish so mush Nolan choose to use CGI here, it would simply be so much better to basically just take the old test footage and recreate it in IMAX quality... Totally missed opportunity just because of Nolan wanting it to be practical and thus totally not what it needed to be... The explosion was close to 90s action movie more than anything else, slowed down gas explosion...

I really hated the constant over the top bass rambling over everything...",2023-07-25 07:25:47
"You HAVE to see it in IMAX if not just for that one scene where they did math at the chalkboard for 8 seconds and then randomly switched to another point in his life for 12 seconds after it. So riveting, never seen anything like it. Crime if it doesn't sweep the Oscars.",2023-07-25 19:07:57
It should have shown the actual bombs dropped on Japan. Both of them.,2023-07-24 05:33:26
"There were two girls, maybe 12 years old tops sitting next to me. Couldn’t believe they sat through the entire 3 hour movie without going on their phones once and had to think to myself what brought them there or how they got into a rated R film in the first place. There was no way they were entertained by this lol.

Least favorite Nolan film to date by the way.  Something was missing here for me, and I think it’s the way Nolan’s dialogue comes across.  For a 3 hour movie that consists of mostly people talking, there wasn’t any energy, suspense, or even urgency to the conversations that were taking place to get me emotionally involved.  I know a lot of the talk performance wise is regarding Cillian Murphy and RDJ but I thought Matt Damon was great in this, especially after how out of place he seemed to be in his scenes shown in the trailers.",2023-07-26 00:52:27
"it’s been a week since i saw it and i think i’m ready to leave my review:

oppenheimer is not a good movie. very ambitious and it tries to do a lot, which should be lauded, but it doesn’t hit most of the marks it needed to. the pacing of much of the movie was breakneck, the score was absolutely fucking relentless, conversations were edited in a way I can only describe as “weird”, the dialogue was at times unintelligible, and the nonlinear editing adds very little to the story outside of a couple memorable scenes. half the time i felt like i was watching a trailer instead of a feature film. nolan refused to let a single moment in this film breathe outside of, like, the immediate aftermath of the trinity test. 

i really liked interstellar and dunkirk and, while i wasn’t crazy about it, i “got” inception. this isn’t that. it just wasn’t good",2023-08-02 23:34:42
"I’m so frustrated. I want to see this in true IMAX and live in Kentucky, but I swear I can’t figure out how to find true imax locations as opposed to the AMC or Cinemark fake IMAX.",2023-07-21 02:26:19
Christopher Nolan wonderfully brought to life reading the Oppenheimer/Manhattan project Wikipedia page at 3am and I really don’t know if I could give anything higher praise than that.,2023-07-21 02:30:02
"absolutely loved it, although I think Christopher Nolan might expect a bit much from the everyday audience. Being familiar with the people involved historically i had no issue, but I have to think some might get lost in the rapid change of context between Oppenheimer's deposition and Strauss's hearing, which the second half leans focuses on heavily.",2023-07-21 02:57:51

I loved that scene and I think it ties back to a theme of the film which is “You dont get to commit a sin and expect the world to weep for you” which is something along the lines of what his wife said to him.,2023-07-21 04:43:38

"The scene where an audience of people (including Oppenheimer) where shown slides of the horror that the bomb did to the Japanese people, every slide, people were visually wincing and looking away.... powerful cinema.... how could anyone not feel morally culpable?",2023-07-21 05:29:50
"Murphy, RDJ, Oldman, and Matt Damon were phenomenal!! I loved the rag tag group of scientists and learning who they seen what they specialize in. Forgot that Einstein and Bohr were alive during this time. 

The rest of the cast was a lot of “oh I’ve seen that face somewhere” but unnecessary to get that known of an actor/actress (Teller, the attorney that was grilling him in the small room, the first American scientist that offers him food all the time that was in 10 Things I Hate About You, the “judge” in the small room, I think the kid from Valerian, etc).  

It makes me think about nationalistic pride then — the concerns of labeling someone fascist or communist; maybe being an anti-war hippie during Viet Nam…. And now. We use the same nationalistic fear today to mark certain people bad or evil. 


My main question is wtf was Florence Pugh’s purpose???",2023-07-21 05:33:33

"Is Oppenheimer having a huge ego a fair takeaway from this? I know RDJ’s character basically believe that in a way and he’s the antagonist of the film, but he’s sorta right in my eyes

Oppenheimer cheated on his wife and ex girlfriend multiple times, and then even before stepping into the office where they were grilling him he bragged about how a husband couldn’t of possibly died of a broken heart from finding out about his wife’s affair with Opp; because he never found out

There’s obviously better examples like how he talks to some people but his constant cheating was the main thing i remember",2023-07-21 06:10:59

"Please respond without spoiling -

Is the explosion scene extremely loud in Oppenheimer, especially in IMAX? I'm a little sensitive when it comes to loud noise, and I don't want to end up with a traumatic experience 🙈. 

Like if it's just a shade louder than action sequences or explosions in other movies, that'd be fine. But if it's something that is unbelievable, like a thunder clap for lightning strike right near you, then I might re-think.",2023-07-21 07:18:47

The IMAX 70 mm option at Lincoln Square NYC is virtually sold out (I'm not sitting in the front row).  (And yes, I feel like a jerk for not getting a ticket the day they came available; I screwed up).

But, I can easily get tickets where I live to see Oppenheimer in IMAX digital (not sure if it's laser or xenon). I'm thinking about seeing it on standard IMAX first, and then seeing it a second time in IMAX 70 mm at Linc Sq *if more showings are added for future dates*. 

Do people think seeing regular IMAX first might lessen the fun/impact of IMAX 70 mm, and therefore I should wait and hope more viewings are added? 

I lean towards the idea that a second viewing would still be fun, but curious for people's views (on this admittedly subjective question).",2023-07-26 00:31:57

"Best Nolan film since Interstellar or even since Inception. Thrilling all the way through even with the timelines jumping around and a huge cast you never really got confused or bored. It was made to be seen in a theatre.

My guesses are that Cillian Murphy, Emily Blund and RDJ all get nominated for academy awards. And the movie itself in almost every category. Idk if it will win that much though, the academy will probably complain about the lack of diversity.",2023-07-22 06:31:02
"Without a doubt in my mind Nolan's greatest work since Interstellar. The very definition of a true must-see cinematic experience, from cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's breathtaking visual imagery — some of which may very well be the most jaw-dropping of Nolan's career — to Ruth de Jong's astoundingly authentic period production design, from Nolan and Jennifer Lame's audaciously experimental editing choices to Ludwig Göransson's gorgeous yet utterly bone-chilling musical score. I'd be grossly amiss not to mention Cillian Murphy's spectacular performance.",2023-07-23 04:20:14

Easily Nolan's best since Interstellar - perhaps better. 100% watching it again in IMAX 70mm this time - I watched on IMAX digital, and while the size and sound were appropriately huge, I got the clear sense that the movie was designed to see everything in maximum resolution - particularly the characters' skin textures, as well as Oppenheimer's various visions (all of which were visually stunning and struck the right balance of beauty and terror).

Every single actor brought their A-game, and it seemed Nolan crammed the cast with famous faces simply because of the sheer number of people involved in the story - having recognizable actors helps keep track of who's who, and nearly all of them got at least one memorable scene. The scenes between Murphy and Damon were definitely my favorites, but RDJ owned every single moment he was in. This is the first time I've seen him not merely play himself, and it's such a leap seeing him go from playing Tony Stark - the man everyone wants to be - to this pathetic, vindictive, resentful guy who feels sidelined by the superstar scientist. They should cast him as an antagonist more often, he was absolutely superb as Strauss. I also loved how Nolan used color for Oppenheimer's POV and black and white for Strauss', which to me seemed to communicate how Strauss' vision of the world - seen through a lens of envy, resentment, and cynicism - is gray, lifeless, and limited, whereas Oppenheimer's world is bursting with the vibrant color of bottomless curiosity and ambition. 

As for the other supporting cast, Blunt and Pugh were enchanting in their relatively limited roles, Jason Clarke was a background presence until he suddenly got to revel in playing an asshole in the final third, and I absolutely loved Josh Hartnett as well (he's fresh off of an intense, spellbinding performance on Black Mirror. Dude can really act.) Rami Malek meanwhile was a distracting presence in that trial scene for a number of reasons, mainly because I feel like he shows his limitation as an actor with every role since Mr. Robot. It always just feels like Elliot straining to speak and emote. I also found the casting of Jack Quaid as the famously charismatic Richard Feynman hilarious, given that he has all the charisma of a wet paper bag on The Boys. I think he had more bongo than dialogue in this film anyway. Benny Safdie as Edward Teller getting that much screentime was another surprise, but he did well with a role that could've become a caricature. Same with Branagh as Nils Bohr, not sure why he's so obsessed with doing accents but it felt significantly less corny here than in Tenet.

The Trinity test. No words, literally. I had it ""spoiled"" that the scene would be sound-free, and after _that_ scene in The Last Jedi the technique didn't feel quite as novel, but the effect it had was undeniable. The scene with the crowd afterwards was in some ways even more striking (and certainly more horrifying).

I mainly want to rewatch because this was one long, complicated movie that refused to hold your hand, and absolutely requires repeat viewings to fully grasp and appreciate. The first third was definitely my favorite because of how alive and kinetic it felt - that ""can you hear the music"" scene at the beginning was jaw-dropping, and the mix of Nolan's frenetic crosscutting between timelines, Goransson's unrelenting music, and the ""training montage"" thrill of watching Oppenheimer quickly rise in stature was mesmerizing. The sections after the Trinity test weren't nearly as tedious as some reviews made it out to be, but they were definitely the most dense, talky portion of the film and the key reason why it should be viewed multiple times.

I just love it when films revisit flashbacks and expand upon them in tidbits to gradually reveal the bigger picture, and this movie utilized this device repeatedly, especially during that devious scene revealing how far Strauss went to sabotage Oppenheimer. But the real stroke of geniuses was the way Nolan ended the movie with that Oppenheimer/Einstein conversation. The movie ended with that same note of intrigue and religious terror that it began with. (Also hilarious that they were indeed talking about something ""more important"" than Strauss, who is now relegated to a blurry figure approaching them out of focus.)

In many ways this movie reminded me heavily of the Dr. Manhattan chapters of Alan Moore's Watchmen, between the constant jumping in time, the tone being both intellectual and melancholic, and of course the character of a depressed, morally anguished, womanizing genius scientist who has unearthed/harnessed otherworldly power. I'd be very surprised if the Dr. Manhattan character wasn't at least partly inspired by Oppenheimer.",2023-07-23 12:04:16

I think it falls around 7-7.5/10 range for me. The 3 timelines was a poor choice and unnecessarily confusing. I felt like the actual building of the nuke should have been the whole focus but it was closed in to just Act 2. And to not see the two bombings was odd although I understand the intended effect of feeling helpless to the powers that be. Everything about the moviemaking aspect was top notch but subverted expectations (whether the silent Trinity test or the courtroom Act 3) really lowered the end result. And there absolutely was no reason to watch this in IMAX. That marketing angle now makes no sense. This is an interesting one-time watch and I'm glad to have seen it. Just not the 10/10 I thought it'd be.,2023-07-24 02:47:51

"People have pointed out their problems with the film in this thread much more eloquently than I could, so I'm only talking about the ending.

To be completely honest, the supposedly gut punching ending didn't get much of a reaction out of me. 

It shows that a nuclear apocalypse is always on the horizon, which I'm already well aware of. And the fact that hasn't materialised nearly 80 years later kind of put a damper on the point. Also people have come up with and been using numerous more ways to kill other people/damage the planet since then.

Some say it's meant to be more general, about pushing the boundaries without considering the consequences and stuff like AI, but the images used were exclusively Oppenheimer riding the bomber plane and nuclear weapons going off. IMO it would have been better if those scenes were cut and we only had the shot of Oppenheimer looking at the pond. Let the audience think what his words mean for themselves.",2023-07-22 22:20:05
"Growing up “JFK” was one of my all time favorite movies with one of the greatest casts ever assembled. 

The historical accuracy of that film is obv probably not great. But that’s besides the point. 

This reminded me of JFK with a much better, more technically skilled director. 

This is gonna be Best Picture. I don’t think there’s any chance it doesn’t win 5-10 Oscars. At least. 

Everything about it was incredible. 

And Nolan finally got the sound mix right as well. There were only like two occasions I had trouble understanding the dialogue. 

I haven’t seen him get a ton of pub from this, but Casey Affleck was fucking terrifying. 

Everyone was so good and nobody really jammed it up I thought. 

Every shot was so sumptuous and technically proficient. 

The editing was also fantastic. All that jumping around could have been a hot mess. But it worked. 

Top 10 movie for me the past 10-20 years. 

Def one of the all time great technical achievements for what is ostensibly just bunch of people sitting around talking for 95% of the movie. 

Every single shot was just so technically proficient. 

It’s kinda wild to see a drama that is almost all just dialogue with nearly no action be shot in IMAX with what must have been absolutely insane amounts of time spent on setups. 

This is an all time great film and technical achievement. 

Every aspect of the sound design and mix was so technically perfect. I think the audio was the most impressive thing.

I really hope this starts a revival in big budget talkie dramas like this. 

This is one of those movies that will be a fixture in film schools forever.",2023-07-24 11:08:02
"Just saw it last night. First half I really enjoyed. I was fascinated by the science and team work behind creating the bomb. I don't understand why the sex scenes were necessary, especially the imaginary one in the hearing was a bit ridiculous, but I was still invested in the creation of the bomb. The last hour or so? It DRAGS on. The movie never properly explains who Strauss is or helps convey why Strauss is so mad at Oppenheimer. I only know his story because I read about it before. And everytime you think the movie is about to end, it keeps going. I think the problem is that everyone came for the bomb and the build up and tension to the bomb is so incredible, that it's just insanely boring afterwards to watch an hr of politics. I understand why they showed his trials and how they made him fade away from the public eye, but it's done in such a way that I wouldn't be surprised if most people went for a nap for the last hr of the movie. I almost dosed off. 

I think other people pointed out, it's hard to understand why Oppenheimer had such a moral dilemma afterwards, when we're never really given any idea of how horrific and devastating the bombs were. We're just shown the test explosion and in the next scene the bombs are sent off and the next scene is the Truman announcing the dropped them on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The whole point of the second part of the movie is showing Oppies resentment of such an invention used to destroy cities and yet in three + hr movie, it doesn't even give 2 mins of headlines or showing the aftermath of the bombs. 

Overall 3/5 from me. It's good but certainly not the best. Cillian is incredible though throughout the movie.",2023-07-30 06:31:38
The criticism Nolan gets is hilarious man. Some people here are just nitpicking for just hating his work it seems. Saw one guy here saying this movie is bad because the way his presentation of women is how a man would look at women in a old fashioned way without any direction like tipical Nolan lead women and got a tons of upvotes.

"What an absolutely INCREDIBLE movie.  One thing I took away from it, and specifically from our main character (Murphy btw...  jaw dropping acting) is how all JRO wanted to do was work and create from  his amazing talents with how he understood the world.   Like an artist who just needs to paint.  He and his mind were above the fray of the world.  Unfortunately the world dragged him down and ultimately consumed him.  An incredible opportunity that he could not pass up ultimately gave him heavy cancerous guilt.  One we cannot even imagine.   Nolan brilliantly keeps every single event including the trinity test just below the most important one.  JRO",2023-07-21 21:34:40

It wasn't really about the science or process of building the bomb, that was sort of background.  There were few challenges to overcome.  It was kinda about his personal life, although critical background info never was really there.  And it almost seemed to be a series of snap shots progressively of his life.  It was kinda about his internal struggle, but again, not really a full picture.

It was pretty, well filmed, and entertaining. But afterwards I find it surprisingly empty.  It's not going to be a movie people watch over and over, I think.  To that end it's going to be more of Oliver Stone's JFK than, like say, a A beautiful mind or the Imitation Game.",2023-07-31 15:47:31

"It's easily the best Nolan film to date.  Not perfect, I had a few gripes with its pacing especially in the first hour or so.

Many of the anecdotes in the movie are stories that every STEM undergrad has heard a million times from people in the physics department.  Such as Kurt Godel and Einstein enjoying walks together.  This movie will be popular amongst those types of people.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much the movie went into Oppenheimer's left-wing views.

"really not sure what I thought of it. The test bomb scene was maybe the best cinema experience I’ve ever had, the build up was perfect and my palms were getting all sweaty, I felt like I was going to have to hold onto my seat. The first hour and third hour showcased some phenomenal acting, but I still feel a bit meh about it. It may be his most ambitious project but I think to say it’s Nolan’s best is a big overstatement. 

Funnily enough, I felt more emotion when Margot Robbie cried in Barbie than when Cillian Murphy cried. Emily Blunt deserves her Oscar but I can very much see Leo and KOTFM taking best actor and best picture.",2023-07-21 18:08:59
"Damn near perfect film. Casey Affleck's part was my only gripe--that was legit some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a major film. He seemed to just be reading the script and nothing else. It was so bad that it took me out of the film for a bit. Surprising since he's been fantastic in plenty of other films. Thankfully he wasn't on screen for very long.

Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and pretty much the rest of the cast did a stellar job.

The explosion scene was really captivating, and the movie was paced beautifully.",2023-07-21 22:48:46
I just think you can't give this film a final score without watching it again. So many things happen that even 3 hours felt it wasn't enough to fully grasp of what we watched. Like the dialogues and names were extremely complicated to follow through without having prior knowledge about physics and Oppenheimer'e life. On a surface level it was a courtroom drama but beneath that there was a lot more going on. From quantum mechanics to Oppenheimer's complex life.

I saw that movie 11 times in theater and today I can't explain why I went through it, because I always knew, from the first viewing, that despite all its qualities, the Phantom Menace wasn't a good, satisfying movie.

"Most of my thoughts so far have already been mentioned by others: fantastic film, everyone fucking killed it in their roles, and the Trinity and speech scenes were a step above. Didn't see it in 70mm but I'm glad I saw it nonetheless. 

Did notice one thing that stuck out to me: in the third act, when Oppenheimer and his lawyer whose name I don't recall are in the hallway waiting on Kitty to arrive, they're having a conversation. Nolan breaks the [180° rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule) during this conversation, having both Oppenheimer and his lawyer fill the same space in frame for each cut. 

Generally the 180° rule is a given for maintaining visual continuity, so if you break it it's either a rookie mistake or a deliberate choice. Given Nolan's experience, I can't help but feel it has to be deliberate. However, I didn't see any reason why he'd break that rule. Did anyone pick up on that?",2023-07-21 09:22:30

"Good movie overall, 8/10 (more like a 7.5/10 but Murphy's acting and Nolan's effects team make it Oscar-worthy).

I definitely felt that runtime. Like everyone is saying, it gets a bit rough after the bomb is dropped. I honestly was a bit underwhelmed, but mostly because I thought the movie would focus less on the politics of the bomb and Oppenheimer's security clearance denial. Was expecting something more along the lines of Interstellar, focusing more on the physics and ethics aspects, but overall not disappointed.

Will be seeing it again Sunday to unpack it a bit more. 3 hours is a commitment, especially on a week day.",2023-07-21 13:49:22
"This quest into the human psyche is no less than a very spiritual experience. To me, this is the most emotionally dense film that Nolan has ever made. That it is recorded history just adds an unbelievable amount of weight to the whole ordeal. Impeccably acted by Cillian Murphy and RDJ in particular, the post Trinity test sequences (especially the last scene between Oppie and Albert) are some of the most haunting scenes ever put to film. The Aaron sorkin-esque dialogue, the editing, and the score - none of these things should coexist successfully in a character study such as this, but Nolan makes it fit like it was just meant to be. I only wish that the symbolism of the Gita was explored a bit more - it perhaps would've given the film even more gravitas, but even in its current form, it merits multiple watches. What a masterpiece. Lots to chew on.",2023-07-21 15:49:50

The test explosion was one of the most powerful and terrifying portrayals I have ever seen of a nuclear bomb in a movie. However, I found myself really wishing for the movie to be shorter.

There was a shit ton of dialogue, and although that's 50% of the movie, my interest in Oppenheimer losing his security didn't matter that much personally at the end.

The music however... Man that was fucking brilliant. I was immediately sold and immersed in the first 20 minutes of the movie and was kept engaged until the last hour. Afterwards it  wasn't that ""engaging"".",2023-07-21 20:43:13
"I like Nolan's work even if not everything he has made was great but this one was really great. Nolan continues to prove himself to be a great filmmaker as his writing, direction and style remains strong. The narrative about Oppenheimer and the dramatic elements happening around his creation and the people was tight and engaging with strong performances from every cast members, beautiful camerawork and score, and a really good pacing. Interactions between characters were well-written and never once felt bored seeing it. The explosion sequence and speech scene was just absolutely stellar. 

The sound design is great although there were certain moments that the sound design that were really loud that made it a little difficult to hear some of the dialogue and a particular sex hallucination that was pretty cringeworthy. But overall, it's a really great film.

"So I went to watch the much publicised Oppenheimer last night, and whew did this movie blow my mind.  
  
The use of shooting of both black and white and color to tell different stories I thought was done really effectively, the acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ was breathtaking and felt real, and the way that Nolan and his cast managed to make what was essentially two very wordy interrogations so fascinating and gripping just goes to show that filmmaking, when done properly, does not need a green screen and visual effects to hold the viewer's attention.  
  
The issue of Oppenheimer on the one hand heading the project that developed the atomic bomb and on the other his opposition to the development of the super, which is Oppenheimer's main struggle during the movie, was compelling and as enigmatic as the man himself.  
  
RDJ's portrayal of Strauss, as a confident back stabber who remembers little slights and takes his time getting his own back was a strong storyline which was fascinating and some of the best acting from RDJ I can remember.  
  
My favorite part of the movie was the sweat inducing scene in which Boris Pash, the man responsible for security at Los Alamos is questioning Oppenheimer at Berkeley, and Oppy is trying as best as he can to not name the name of his friend.

Personally I felt like the movie executed everything perfectly. I loved the black / white to color transitions, non-linear narrative was the right choice to tell this story and I absolutely loved the trinity test sequence it was such tension inducing moment even though you know they will push that button.

"A lot of people saying this movie is really good, I think we all had been exposed to bad to mid movies in these past few years that anything close to decent will exceed everyone's expectations. It's a good movie, dont get me wrong, but personally, I think it is not rewatchable. Generally you want to see what you cant read in a biopic, yes it has excellent performance from the actors but what really dissapoints me is the bomb testing scene. It is very underwhelming for such a build up, Id rather see an accurate look of a cgi bomb, showing it's grand scale, why no cgi? nothing bad with cgi, he literally made a cgi blackhole before and it's glorious. I get it nolan wants to show oppenheimer's expression, but I want to see the bomb too, not a zoomed pity-ass fireball, if this is the case, id rather not see the bomb at all, because what the characters say about it is more terrifying than what is shown lol. On the other hand though, I also think it's the first comedy take from Christopher Nolan, so many genuinely really funny scenes, with a small hint of horror. Now I really want to see Nolan's take on pure horror genre.

Loved it. Actual masterpiece by Nolan. His apex mountain easily.,2023-07-29 06:01:48
"This film reminded me of a funny joke by Frankie Boyle about how Americans will bomb and invade your country, and about twenty years later will make a movie about how bombing you made them sad.

First, the acting performances ranged from great to mystifying. Cillian Murphy gave a very solemn, dignified performance as Oppenheimer which paired well with Emily Blunt's lady Macbeth. Matt Damon is good in everything he's in but he has too much of a babyface to portray a WW2 commanding officer. RDj was mystifying. He's supposed to play an elder statesman in the higher echelon of gov't but much like his movie the Judge, he can't reign his eccentric tone in when the movie requires it. Benny Safdie felt like a poor parody while Jason Clark and Josh Harnett were competent. 

The Florence Pugh subplot felt completely shoehorned in as was Oppenheimer's general womanizing. More than a few people cringed in the theatre at *that* scene in the ""trial"" and it felt completely out of place and something Oliver Stone would do in the 90s. 

The best parts were seeing the town being assembled and the scientists working together. The worst parts were his supposed communist activities i.e. dinner parties, unionizing as well as his guilt trip fetish. Nolan doesn't seem like he has anything interesting to say about his politics except that he was cagey and non-committal to them when it came time to his career advancement. 

Nolan wants us to know Oppenheimer felt real guilt but he's never been able to explain why It's important for us to know about it. And that's the central problem with an otherwise well executed film. You need to have a compelling character at the centre of this movie and you don't really have one. Just someone incapable of committing to anything. Not to his wife, his children, his friends, his work or his beliefs.",2023-07-21 04:12:59
"Eh.  Einstein was cool.  Loved the JFK drop.  Damon's character seemed good.

Issues:

1) Nolan should have CGI the Trinity test because a small c4 explosion and camera flash wasn't real enough to the source.  If he didn't want CGI, I'm sure he could have found old footage of the Trinity test and edited it in.

2) All the congressional hearings I felt were dry and made the film drag on.  FBI investigation was okay.  

3) Wasn't anything about his family life which I think his wife was abusive to their kids.  Only thing they had was take the kid to brother's house when they cried.  

4) I'm surprised Nolan didn't show the Hiroshima footage.  Show slight reaction from Oppenheimer.  Even though he tells Truman he has blood on his hands, he doesn't act like it, but when the fling suicide he gets paranoid and the wife has to tell him to pull his shit together.  So what I'm trying to say is Nolan could have added a bit more like he loses sleep over nightmares or something.  I just feel like this wasn't good enough.

5) Feels like without Nolan and the famous cast, this would have been a NETFLIX series.  I went to it thinking it'd be awesome because of the names tied to the project, but I feel like it didn't deliver for me.  Saw the trailer for Barbie and it looks like Grease but with Will Ferrell.  Feel like money and time would have been better spent.",2023-07-21 08:11:11
"Wow, genuinely one of the most incredible movies I've ever experienced in IMAX cinema. And I've seen Avengers Endgame and Avatar in IMAX.

Cillian, in my personal opinion, this was his 2nd best ever performance (first being Thomas Shelby: Peaky Blinders), he was a mix of emotional and incredible. 

I genuinely can't think of one bad thing to say about this movie cause it genuinely is nothing but fantastic.

Nolan has outdone himself once again.",2023-07-21 16:02:34
"I didn't really have much empathy for Oppenheimer.  The Strauss conflict came together decently, but I didn't exactly view Strauss as a ""bad guy"" despite the movie wanting me too.    

I also wanted more scenes like the one with Truman.  Oppenheimer thought it was all about him, as if Truman didn't have his own moral struggles to deal with.  

I wish Nolan would learn to record dialogue in a way that can be understood.  I felt that half the conversations were almost impossible to understand.   

Movie was decent/good.  I give it a B.",2023-07-21 18:58:32
"Eh not that interesting really. You really need context for these sort of things. My context was the line from Sapiens where it says for the first time humanity had the ability to destroy itself. Sapiens is a popular book amongst people who read but probably not that popular among the average cinema goer.
I dunno, I just didn't really get it, the movie didn't none of the work, anything significant was just conjured up in my own mind.

This is a director who's best known work features a scene where a character goes ""violating civil liberties is wrong Batman! Which is why I'm only going to help you do it once because catching this terrorist is really important.""

I was not expecting Oppenheimer to be eviscerated so hard for his whinging non-committal centrism.

Like he goes so far out of his way to tell his communist friends that he's not a communist but then the right wing government castrates him for having communist friends anyways.",2023-07-23 15:23:40

Was anyone else bothered by the fact that the score was unnecessarily noticable during many of the dialogue scenes? I often felt like they should've just let the actors do their thing and have the performances speak for themselves rather than having an overly-dramatic soundtrack play over them.

" Incredible, incredible movie. What do you think was the significance of showing the “current day” scenes of the trial in black and white?

"Saw the film last night, a little bit hard for my brain to follow at times (terrible with names and faces) but it was really good! I could feel the explosions in my body - the sound was that loud, it was truly terrifying at times. It was interesting to see the other side of the bombs, the perspective of the people who built it. I watched Grave of the Fireflies when I was a kid which is the kind of film that sticks to you, and I think this one will stick with me too. The ending was brilliant, the haunted look in his eyes will stay with me I think",2023-07-22 08:59:04

"Amazing experience, and a movie worth going to the theatres for. While not Nolan's best work, it is arguably his most soul searching.

I don’t agree with y’all on the mixing choices. I’m slightly hard of hearing and could understand the dialogue despite it being lower. The rest of it seems like a defensible artistic choice to drive the chaotic suspense leading up to Trinity.,2023-07-24 16:51:26

"So I have watched Oppenheimer twice and saw couple of things why for me it was a standout and I will list them down below 

1. Despite a lot of events to be covered, the screenplay never failed to put Oppenheimer out of the viewpoint. The character here still was squarely important and we were traversing the fim from his viewpoint. One great scene was when oppenheimer was delivering his thanks and the background becomes shaky unsettled almost rushing out of the lens of the camera depicting the Oppenheimer slow realisation. Immediately after that he imagined the audience of the speech to be good burned down in the atomic bomb. Absolutely brilliant scripting and far more effective than showing let's say Japanese facing the same outcome. The scene alone in itself established two different viewpoints one the breakdown of Oppenheimer and the tragedy of impact of the blast


2. I absolutely loved the inspiration from the social network . The structure of the social network movie rooted in the interrogation and moving back and forth putting up a sense of urgency for me is masterfully adapted. The HARD CUTS of the Nolan which is he is known for complimented the scripting so well as movie switches to high gear and moves back and forth across three different scenes... This is the movie that I feel will grow the audience so well on repeat viewing


3. This point is direct expansion ot the above that for me one of the absolute pleasure I can derive from celluloid when the dialogue gives you feeling of pleasurable rush. I absolutely live for these scene and I remember again social network did this segment particularly well when mark was in the interrogation room with twins . 


Wonderful Wonderful stuff and it reminded me why I love screenwriting so much. It's not so much about the story but how story was presented in celluiliod that's what matters. Would love to hear you all opinion",2023-07-26 09:53:42

"Very ‘Interstellar’ vibes. I loved it. Not the biggest Nolan fan but this was incredible and I love the gravity with which the subject matter was handled. It felt heavy, as it should. It was extremely well casted and the cinematography, the quote in the beginning, the final line.. movies like this come around every few years for me. I’m going to be thinking about it for a while.",2023-08-07 02:53:23
"Wife and I saw it last night. My father is a WWII buff (I’m in my mid-late 40s now) so he remembers a lot of this stuff from his youth as it happened. I knew about Oppenheimer since I was around 10 years old and was fascinated on the topic of how the bomb came to be.

What I stand by now and then is, Oppenheimer knew what the bomb would do. He knew it would kill hundreds of thousands and maybe more in the future. Yet he still created it. Then felt remorse later. How is that supposed to garner sympathy. This wasn’t a bomb that would only take the life’s of soldiers. This took women, children, pets, and everything living. He knew this and went forward. 

His scientist tried to rationalize (in the film) that since Germany surrendered (when Hitler died), they should abort. However, they still would’ve killed people in the camps too if Germany was the target. 

I loved the film technically, and it was very well acted (there will be a lot of Oscar noms for this), but Nolan trying to “humanize” Robert and his scientist just didn’t work for me. And I wouldn’t be surprised at all if most of their remorse was fabricated.",2023-07-21 12:55:12
"I am a huge Nolan fan. The movie was technically excellent in almost every way. The acting was great across the board (with exception of Damon I thought)

But the payoff wasn’t all that good in my opinion. I felt like Oppenheimer’s character was underdeveloped. Was I suppose to feel empathy? See him as bipolar manic? A puppet?

Those were my initial feelings. I left the cinema questioning how I should feel, while acknowledging that the movie was a technical masterpiece.",2023-07-21 16:10:16
"I was very excited to see this film, but it just didn't do it for me. Should have known, given that I haven't really been crazy about a Nolan film since The Prestige. Great effects, amazing acting, but a rather lackluster script. I've never been a fan of Nolan's use of music in his movies, either. Overall, I prefer Barbie.",2023-07-21 19:10:04
"This movie was good but far from great. Thematically, I can see why Nolan was interested in the Oppenheimer story and he largely succeeds at making us leave the movie with some really mind bending questions about human civilization, ambition, morality, and our capacity for destruction. But the movie itself is riddled with enough problems that it detracts from the wonderful testing scenes, and the excellent ending scenes. I agree with others who have said the first hour of the movie feels way too rushed. The dialogue is not as crisp as others have said: so much obvious exposition and everybody happens to have a great oneliner under their belt? I also think the movie is plagued by the typical Nolan ""playing loud music over characters talking"" issue that has been present in all his films. Dude, sometimes you have to let people speak (the Truman scene was great of course).

I think two other things deflated my experience: Robert Downey Jr and Albert Einstein's almost comical appearance. People complained about Matt Damon but you guys are fine with Downey Jr? I couldn't shake Tony Stark/Ironman out of my head every time he appeared on screen. On top of that, he had the same cadence/manner of speak as Tony Stark. And his makeup was god awful. And to the guy who played Einstein--such unnecessary caricaturing. The audience I was with literally laughed when he popped on the screen.

These issues took me out--and they took me out in the sense of I was reminded that I'm watching a movie that was made, rather than the engrossing experience that was supposed to make me transcend the fact that I'm watching a film. Pros were Cillian Murphy, who was fantastic. And the middle to final act.",2023-07-22 00:48:43

"Pretty good movie, badly done vfx. Nolan is really trying to stretch that ""practical effects"" only route but it just feels off.

The trinity bomb test should've felt grand, don't get me wrong, I don't want it to look amazing or cool, but could the explosion at least LOOK horrifying?

No doubt the sound design was on point on the scene but that practical effects explosion hardly demonstrated the power of nuclear weapons.",2023-07-22 14:49:21

Eating breakfast, petting their dog, walking to work. Really show the victims were humans not a number. Then BOOM!!!. FUCKING wasteland. charred buildings, roads, people. Screaming and devastation.

I genuinely feel it could of been one of the most intense moments in cinema. The moive was excellently crafted but i don't think the plot or script was.",2023-07-22 22:50:28

"Urh something has happened to Nolan with both this and Tenet .. both movies were kind of 

1)Over-Scored’ - over use of build up music with even 2 characters just talking to each other, early conversations in the movie even have a tension build up score .. awful 

2) Awful romance aspect - Both in Tenet and I’m sorry in Oppenheimer as well I just did not care.. why makes us not g.a.s about his wife at the start if she’d start becoming semi-integral to the court room plot at the end. I didn’t care for any of it, similar to Tenets Washington romance plot. Nolan sucks at this. It was laughable when he came home to her drunk cause I forgot this character even existed..

3) Weird scene chopping speeds and audio mixing - absolutely all the wrong speeds and volume",2023-07-23 05:50:23
"Finally saw it last night at a sold-out 70MM screening. After reading the terrific, riveting tome that is ""American Prometheus"" last month in preparation for this, I had as high expectations one could ever have for ""Oppenheimer"" - and it met if not shattered them all. An impossibly magnificent adaptation from Nolan that is the stunning culmination of everything he's ever achieved so far as a writer-director. 

Like 95% of what's covered in ""Prometheus"" is in the film, which is impressive on its own given how dense the material is. But how Nolan ambitiously separates all the main story and character threads, intertwines and intersects them, then unravels them before distinctly converging all of them again in the final hour is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in my mind. And his few major changes/enhancements beyond what ""Prometheus"" did were damn well executed as well. Easily the best film adaptation of this century, alongside what Spielberg and Kushner did with ""Lincoln."" And all the crafts are superlative as well, from the IMAX cinematography to the prolific but surgical editing to Ludwig Goransson's score to the sound design.

Murphy was pitch perfect casting for Oppenheimer, so my expectations were high - but he surpassed them all with a towering performance that captures all of the complexities and idiosyncrasies of a generational intellect with a preternatural ability to synthesize turned scientific prophet turned political martyr - all while showing that Oppie was a very flawed person with certain vulnerabilities that resulted in his downfall. Matching him every step of the way is RDJ, who somehow managed to humanize the otherwise reprehensible Lewis Strauss and make him a three dimensional, pathetically vainglorious antagonist instead of a cartoon supervillain, brutally Machiavellian in his quest for power but also pitiable in his need for validation. The way RDJ and Nolan peel back Strauss over the length of the film is nothing short of complete mastery. 

The very large supporting ensemble is very strong as well, with so many great performances from Damon (whom I would not have chosen to portray Leslie Groves), Krumholtz, Hartnett, Ehrenreich, Safdie, Branagh... and yes even Blunt and Pugh - who absolutely did the most they could with their characters. 

For me, I have no hesitation saying ""Oppenheimer"" is the pinnacle achievement of Nolan’s career — a dense, intellectually probing and existentially challenging work that is one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of the past decade. It certainly is the the best film of 2023 for me.",2023-07-23 18:53:32
"10/10 cinematography, 8/10 acting, 5/10 story telling, 7/10 message.

I did not understand at all the reason to include his cheating scenes, especially nudity, other than the fact to illustrate how he might be questioned for being a commie and how morally conflicted he is. Nolan said in an interview oppenheimer's relation with women is a huge part of his identity, but I didn't necessarily get that message through the film. I also didn't understand why a third of the movie was about Strauss...

Another complaint I have is how stale and 1-d emily blunt and matt damon's character were.

Beside that, solid historical movie, did really well to depict oppenheimer's moral dillema",2023-07-23 23:41:47

"This movie suffered from having too much to say in such little time.  The middle section was so fast paced that there wasn't much time to breathe and reflect on what you are watching, which reduced the impact it had.   Oftentimes, scenes would last only a minute and that was quite frustrating after two hours. This movie would have been much better as a limited series allowing for more time to be spent on the making of the atomic bomb (which I personally find fascinating given what I have read in Richard Rhodes classic book).

The sound mixing was awful, which isn't surprising given that it is Nolan.  I don't understand why you need loud music in a movie that can be classified more as a courtroom drama than an action movie.  I am not saying I dislike the courtroom drama (the hearings were interesting to me), but why the need for loud music?  Does anyone remember loud ass music being played in movies like A Few Good Men? Nolan should have watched that movie before embarking on creating this one.

The bomb was fairly underwhelming to me.  It is odd that Nolan is so focused on showing Oppenheimer's perspective, yet most of the explosion is a closeup shot.  You could tell these were practical effects.  I think the biggest reason why it had such limited impact was because the archival footage is scary enough.  The archival footage could have been utilized to maximize the impact and it is more representative of what Oppenheimer and the scientists would have seen 20 miles away.

The ending also had almost no impact on me, but I have a fairly nuanced view of nuclear weapons.  While they have the capacity to cause genocide, they have created around 70 years of peace between the superpower nations.  There is no guarantee that that will last, but I think it is worth noting.  Honestly, a more reliable, cost-effective GMD program that can counteract ICBMs could have a more negative impact in making superpower nations much less hesitant to make war with another (but it would safeguard nations from the annihilation, so once again there is some nuance there).

Overall, it was an 8/10.  This is definitely not Nolan's masterpiece.  I rank TDK, Inception, and the Prestige higher than this movie.",2023-07-23 15:16:45
"My partner hated how chaotic the first act felt, rapidly pinballing from scene to scene with little room to breathe or process what was happening. He said it felt like they were trying to cram a lot of information into a set amount of time.

I disagree. I saw it as a manifestation of the a-bomb’s mechanism of many fissions - smaller “explosions” in different parts of his life that quickly ricocheted off of each other, causing a domino effect of life choices that culminated in a “fusion” with the trial towards the end. Maybe this is obvious or maybe I’m reading to much into it but I thought it was fun to think about. Phenomenal piece.",2023-07-24 00:10:51
"What part about Oppenheimer being a biography means it can't portray the appearance and scale of nuclear bombs accurately? Especially when the consequences of that power existing in human hands is THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE MOVIE.

It just feels so pretentious to shoot a biopic about Oppenheimer on Imax cameras, but not even show the bomb.",2023-07-25 07:35:17
"Great movies have at least 1 scene that completely resonantes with you, the one you keep talking about afterwards. For me, this film lacked that. There are a lot of good things in there and all the performances were on point but the entirety of it just didn't blow me away (pun intended).

It starts out with a pretty big mistake when Oppenheimer gives a lecture in Dutch. I am Dutch, it's my native language and I had no clue what he was trying to say. 

When you're trying to sell that a character is a genius who can easily learn languages, commit to it or mention it in passing so no audience member can ""check it"". The only proper Dutch I've seen a Hollywood actor speak was Matt Damon in the first Bourne movie. He only says a few things but his pronunciation is absolutely spot on despite Damon having no proficiency in the language. 

Some other viewers were bored by all the talking but I didn't mind it; the actors involved were good enough to keep things flowing, but as a result nothing really stands out. 

Also feel free to call me a prude but the nudity didn't add anything to the film at all. It was just uncomfortable to watch because it felt so off compared to everything else. I honestly don't get what Nolan was trying to achieve with that other than increasing the rating? Florence Pugh's character was in my opinion completely wasted. Not her fault, she's a decent actress but Nolan gave her zilch to work with.

A similar complaint can be made about Kitty but Emily Blunt acted her ass off in a way that hinted at there being much more to this woman than what we were shown.

Also what was up with Oppie attempting to poison his professor (that he later admitted to actually liking)? That was never really explained. 

Robert Downey Jr was a standout as Strauss, super refreshing to see him do something so different. 

Cillian was magnificent, I just wish the movie was better than it was. The bomb scene was disappointing; of all the times Nolan wanted to focus on practical effects this was not the scene to do it. 

Anyway, overall I did like it but I don't think I'll ever rewatch it.",2023-07-25 15:40:21
MAGA people real conflicted right now if they just learned that Jews built the bomb.,2023-07-25 18:51:50
"Unpopular opinion: I think Nolan's choice to use practical effects for the Trinity was a terrible idea.

First of they didn't even use enough explosives, what was that? Like 1 ton of TNT with gasoline tanks on top? It was pathetic.

A nuke isn't fiery in the conventional sense so those close-ups of what looks like a typical movie explosions where absolutely terrible.

The representation of the flash and then then shockwave where good, but th explosion itself couldn't even be compared to something like the [Beirut explosion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws7DgCj-0Hc). I mean just look at that, it's like 5% of the energy of the Trinity Test then go look back at the explosion of the film.

&#x200B;

Just... No, some things require proper CG.",2023-07-27 22:02:49
"Extremely overhyped, IMO; could have been way shorter. While you'd expect the science-y parts to be the most technically intense bit about watching this movie, I found very little was shown about that for a subject like this. Found the two timelines very confusing, and dialogue was very difficult to understand. Did not enjoy.",2023-07-30 03:09:48
"Have to say, I was disappointed by this movie. Maybe it was because of all the hype and therefore I overhyped it myself but I just didn't enjoy it overall. In fact, had I been at the cinema alone, I probably would have gone home at the interval as I was so bored. 

Second half of the movie is much more interesting, so was at least glad I stayed to see the test etc. I like intellectually stimulating movies but this was a bit overkill. SO much talking, like non stop. It was back and forth and very fast paced, I don't know how non native English speakers can keep up with it. 

Then the time jumps etc, wow was that sometimes very confusing. I know Nolans movies always have a full circle and a climax but this had so many little circles constantly going that you had to keep up with that I just didn't care anymore. I feel like this movie could have been much simpler and still as effective. 

Glad I saw it, but will definitely not watch it again.

*on a positive note - the acting was unreal. I don't think there was a single bad performance, hell, I'd say everyone was incredible",2023-07-31 12:47:41

Just saw it and my god this might be one of the best films I’ve saw. Just hand Cillian Murphy the best actor Oscar and Oppenheimer best picture already lol. Does anyone know the name of the book Nolan was given that inspired him to make this?,2023-07-28 21:57:47
I thought Oppenheimer was incredible. Amazing filmmaking and casting on Nolan’s part. I’m usually very critical of movies and I’d give it a full 10.,2023-08-03 18:00:23
"Pugh's plot overstayed its welcome, could've cut 3 mins there. The opener was probably 10 minutes too long of ""Oppie is a genius who sees lights and ripples"". 

Otherwise pretty phenomenal.",2023-07-31 19:22:40
"It's... fine. Probably the highlights would be the two ""explosions"": the Trinity Test and the prosecution's interrogation. The Trinity Test has to be seen in theaters to be fully appreciated. The scenes leading up to it and the eventual explosion are incredible to see. 

But I'm not a fan of Florence Pugh's scenes (her making Oppie read THAT line is ridiculous). I felt no attachment to any of the characters at all. Even the revelation of RDJ's betrayal didn't have any impact because the movie felt oddly paced. 

Still, I enjoyed my time with it. It's a lot better than Tenet, at the very least.",2023-07-21 07:19:02
"It was just alright for me. I really like the physics part and how a lot of influential scienctists were portrayed in it, how they built the bomb and executed it and his trauma over it and but didn't really like the communist part and lot of the American names mentioned flew over my head. The last act with the court room and Strauss character was confusing AF. I am a diehard Nolan fanboy and had high hopes but kinda disappointed NGL :(",2023-07-21 18:31:51
"Great, great, great movie.

Saw it in garden-variety IMAX, not 70mm film.. purposely sat in back row so sound would not wallop me.. . the scenes of New Mexico scenery were amazing... get a great perspective from the back row, although next time I might move 15 rows down and wear light earplugs...

Dialog all clear for me... unclear dialog might be from sound mixing in the middle of theaters.

Overwhelmingly amazing is the sympathetic. portrait of just about everyone... even Pash and Nichols but least so...  it is easy to demonize Teller and Strauss, and to some extent Lawrence and Groves... but Nolan kept everyone incredibly human, well, the actors get huge credit too... Downey in particular.

Amazing too that in today's ADHD age, held my interest... because the script and direction was so condensed while sympathetic.  Remarkable achievement.

Although Strauss loses in the movie, the subtext is that he, Teller, Lawrence, Groves, among others, really won... while the acting of Oldman as Truman was great, that moment was a little bit of a lost opportunity.  The democratic leaders in WWII... Churchill and Truman, and all their deputies, knew full well that they were ordering millions to die, and were IMO psychologically sophisticated in their handling of the trauma from those decisions.

I thought the script made Truman too shallow.  Better would have been instead of portraying Truman as shallow, portray him as having struggled with all the same things Oppenheimer struggled with, but just couldn't handle his top scientist laying more guilt on everyone.",2023-07-21 19:49:34
This movie is phenomenal.,2023-07-22 05:01:52
"I'm left feeling that of all the fascinating questions to ask about nuclear weapons, this film didn't ask anything that interesting.

For everyone saying they were so haunted by the ending, i kind of want to ask why? Isn't the reality that the invention of the nuclear weapon perhaps set of a chain reaction that would end the world obvious? Would you really expect Oppenheimer to not be aware of that? Is that really that profound of a thing for him to reveal he believes? 

The invention of the bomb pretty much objectively had the potential to destory the world, why should i be stunned that Oppenheimer recognised that?

There's more interesting questions to me about the nuclear bomb, that i'd hoped the film would explore more. Questions like, has the nuclear bomb ultimately saved lives and prevented great wars? (pakistan and india is the only time two nuclear armed states have gone to war?)

To me, taking all this history, and just asking - ''wouldn't the guy who constructed what could be our total destruction, feel guilty about that?'' isn't that interesting, because, i mean......duh.",2023-07-22 14:16:02

"I’m a bit of an Oppenheimer nerd having watched and rewatched Sam Waterston play him in the 1980 BBC produced seven-part series and then deep-diving the Trinity test and other documentary footage available on YouTube as well as reading on the subject.  I wanted to like the Nolan version, but ultimately was disappointed.  I snorted and rolled my eyes at my friends at the love scene where he recites the famous “I am Death, the Destroyer of Worlds“—which Oppie said went through his mind when the test explosion occurred.  The whole thing with the Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss had too many inaccuracies to cite here (e.g. Einstein-Oppenheimer whispering something to each other was not the reason Strauss wanted Oppenheimer‘s security clearance revoked).  I was bracing myself for some astounding special fx but was underwhelmed (from what I read about the Trinity blast was that even though it was 5:30 am and still dark, the initial flash lit up the sky like high noon for miles around.  Oppenheimer was never a Communist—he certainly had associations who were especially during his Berkeley days as were most young intellectuals during the Great Depression.  He was indeed a womanizer—he was a charismatic l lover of music, literatue and the arts.  There’s more I could say but I’m not a writer as such.  I suggest catching the geeky-nerdy version of this remarkable pivotal time in world history. The quality isn’t the best but I did a search and it looks like someone is in the process of digitizing it.

"
I have recently watched the movie and overall I liked it, but this question haunts my mind. Oppenheimer? A cunt. His wife? A cunt. The woman who he cheats on his wife with? A cunt. The general who runs the place? A cunt. Ede Teller? A cunt. Strauss? A cunt. Oppie's teacher at uni? A cunt. 80+% of all the characters are insufferable, rude, disrespectful jerks for no good reason. Is everything okay at home Hollywood? In my experience its the opposite, 80+% of people are decent, kind and at least courteous if they have a bad day. Does everyone in the film industry (or California?) behave like that, so writers think it's how reality is? Were they trying to convey the inner tension and moral dilemmas of making the atombomb by having the people throw shade for no reason? Help me understand..",2023-08-21 12:16:11
"Saw it in 70mm today in NYC. First Nolan movie I really liked. Expertly crafted and paced, great acting and photography. Trinity test didn't bother me because that's not really what the film is about; I thought it was handled artfully.

Only flaws; I wasn't always in love with the aggressive sound design including yet another Ludwig soundtrack. I've been tired of his style for a long time. Nolan can't resist letting the soundtrack swell and overcome everything, and then DROP OUT suddenly. Feels cliche. Robert Downey Jr. with a career high performance. Harry Truman actor a nice surprise and a perfect cameo.

That, and also, let's just show Pugh's tits a few times including during the most generic sex scene imaginable.  Seriously, it even has the ""I'm inserting your penis"" physical acting that always strikes me funny (after she grabs the book and gets back on).",2023-07-21 22:33:05

If any director other than Nolan did it these simps would be complaining over it.  Not to mention the movie felt like it had music non-stop other than during the explosion scene. It’s okay to just let people talk. You don’t need music blaring over it. 

Overall, a good movie held back by lame decisions.

A big one I’m hearing is that the explosion wasn’t good enough. People wanted to see a massive explosion instead. That’s just not what happened though, the Trinity test is a small bomb compared to what we’ve done since. It’s just not a massive bomb by modern standards. 

Another one is that there is no room to breathe in the film. That’s because that was Oppenheimer’s life, jumping from one thing to the next. Every time he tried to process things and reflect, he didn’t get the chance.",2023-07-24 02:14:00

"Saw this last night and slept on it before writing my thoughts:

PRO:

- Cillian Murphy was Dr. Oppenheimer.  Great, great performance.  I have been wanting to see Cillian Murphy in a lead role and this delivered to my expectations, which were sky high to begin with.  IMHO Murphy's cerebral performance fit well with Nolan's penchant for directing movies with such content.

- The dramatic takes balanced between adding sensation and thus excitement to the movie without going off the rails with creative license.  I can understand people's gripes with the sanskrit scene and seemingly unnecessary nudity but IMHO it played very well in the security clearance screening when his relations with the Pugh character became a sore spot.  I mean, security clearance screenings are supposed to be very boring lol.

- I liked how the bomb scenes were handled.  It is indeed not supposed to immediately have sound...the shockwave and the concomitant rumbling and debris is when the sound comes into play, and the contrast with the silence and the shockwave was very well done.

- Similarly the gym scene, and that it was louder than the bomb scene, resonated with the notion that the true impact and scope of the bomb was less than that of WWII and more that it became a far larger phenomenon and changed everything about war itself.  

- I thought the moral implications were well handled.  Yes, the people at Los Alamos cheering the bombs being dropped was historically significant given these scientists had devoted several years of their life to developing a weapon to ending the war, and there was indeed a lot of anti-Japanese sentiment in America during the time.  That such hate culminated in the gym scene and Oppenheimer having a crisis of conscience as he saw people's faces peeling off in front of him was well done.  There was significant discussion in the movie about exactly how horrific the weapon Oppenheimer had helped to develop was in practice, versus the theoretical challenges and the thrill of discovery involved in developing such a weapon in the first place.

CONS

- RDJ and the Strauss character felt like a second movie attached to Oppenheimer.  Perhaps this was the intent, to highlight the ego of one man and how it threatened to alter the discourse about the bomb, but IMHO that plays way too much into the Iron Man mystique and felt wholly unnecessary.  I was rolling my eyes in the final act when they had to tell Strauss that the chain of events in the movie wasn't about him.  They could have demonstrated the same by simple removing the character entirely from the movie.  That there were greater forces at play antagonistic to Oppenheimer could have been suggested without introducing Strauss at all.  This would have cut 30-45 minutes off the movie and made it better.

- Minor gripe, but not sure what Rami Malek's role was in this movie.  Didn't even know he was a PhD until he was introduced in the final hour in the movie in front of the Senate hearing...I thought he was at best a lab tech and was wondering why they gave him any screen time at all.  This probably follows from the fact that his significance was tied to the Strauss character, which I also felt was wholly unnecessary.

- Another minor gripe, did not understand how Teller was interpreted as antagonistic.  I get that the Blunt character didn't like him...I must have missed exactly why.

---

Overall I thought this was a great biopic and liked how Nolan handled the material.  I find it difficult to compare to Nolan's other movies, which were works of imagination and fictional storytelling.  IMHO Oppenheimer fits more with Dunkirk, except that not being British I must confess I didn't even know of its historical significance until I saw the trailer for Dunkirk.  I was more interested in the subject matter of Oppenheimer and thus was more satisfied with the story.

edit - grammar",2023-07-22 12:59:18
They didn't include his interview where he says his famous line? Thats a crime on its own. And I don't consider the two other times. I needed to hear him announce to the word how badly he thought we all just cock'd up.,2023-07-23 23:21:25

"I was lucky enough to experience it in IMAX 70mm and it was one of my most immersive theater screenings ever. Christopher Nolan arguably made some of the best films of the 21st century, but his last two films were disappointing to me when it came to how he handled the characters. Oppenheimer puts him back in his prime. It’s dialogue-heavy, but the airtight pace keeps me engaged. Cillian Murphy gave his greatest performance, an Oscar nom guaranteed. The fact that all the actors involved did not phone it in, even for those A-listers with only one scene, shows their dedication, but also Nolan’s intelligence in choosing the right faces. I really loved it",2023-07-24 06:40:36
"I felt the movie was pretty damn good considering 99% of it was just dialogue. There were a lot of scenes that were kind of confusing due to the nature of telling the story kind of out of order, as well as a few scenes where contextually it felt like their explanation was glossed over especially if you were like me and know the history of the project but aren't an expert (IE when they go under the football stadium, or all the talks about the hydrogen bombs before the story has even moved past the original bomb, etc.). the sound mixing was also a bit off in some scenes causing the dialogue to be really muffled but that may have just been the theater's fault

I also found Florence Pugh's character kind of pointless other than to demonstrate that Oppenheimer's relationship with his wife was kind of rocky. I don't think of myself as a prude but it just seemed so out of place every time the movie (granted only twice) just flashed to her nude and the jumps that reintroduced her character added to an already frustrating sequencing of events. Not to mention that in the tail end they suggest that he had also been seeing the blonde woman the whole time too. 

Also, how did Rami Malek get all of that information for the hearing that we as the audience just found out Strauss had kept so covert? It suggests that Strauss's aide (Alden Ehrenreich) may have leaked the information to him but doesn't actually confirm it and I don't know why they wouldn't unless it's made up for the sake of the movie

It was also fun to keep finding more familiar actors in small roles here or there. Otherwise it fills the runtime; it only started feeling really long towards the end because I had to pee like a racehorse at which point I had my own anxiety-driven stadium moment like Oppenheimer as I sprinted from the theater when the end title came up",2023-07-24 12:25:46
"Okay so did Nolan definitely say there were zero CGI shots used in the movie at all? Because if that's the case, then I'd really wanna know how they achieved those ones during the end.",2023-07-24 15:18:24
"I loved the movie but have a few questions I feel like I missed.
 1. What did bring in the sheets mean when openheimer would say it to his wife?

"When Oppenheimer talked to Einstein at the pond, wasn't that supposed to be when Oppenheimer first started teaching? There were two scenes, one in the beginning and one at the end. The first scene, Oppenheimer started his teaching career at Berkley, and he talked to Einstein at the pond. This was before he made the bomb. In the second scene, we find out that Oppenheimer told Einstein that he believes the world will be destroyed, implying the pond scene was after the creation of the bomb. Is this just a plothole?",2023-08-06 03:30:54

"Indiana Jones would make for a good parallel.

Imagine one of those movies, but instead of the adventure - or whatever exploratory shit he does - being the main plot, it's merely part of the background, with the main focus being on Indiana's anxiety over what the ramifications might be over taking some treasure, and whether he really is an archeologist. 

Also, all that would've been the first half of the movie. The second half of the movie would be about Indiana defending his doctorate or research or whatever against the evil board of the university.

That's Oppenheimer",2023-07-23 13:13:27
"I genuinely think this is possibly the greatest example of storytelling that has ever been told. Whilst the plot and acting are obviously brilliant - it’s hard to rate those aspects compared to other, equally brilliant films or shows. 
However, the storytelling 🤯 (only appropriate emoji lol) and the overarching metaphors in this film are both subtle and immense. From the beginning of the film we are thrown in at the deep end with differing scenes occurring in courtrooms, laboratories - in colour and black and white - and the narrative seems somewhat scrambled and confused. I found myself worrying we were in for another mindfuck from Nolan. Then as the film progressed, the ideas and narrative seemed to condense and the pinnacle of this seems to arrive at the point of the creation of the bomb itself (the trinity test) where we have effectively the longest unbroken scene of the entire film (I.e. minimal jumping around in the timeline etc). I believe this initial condensing of the storyline itself to be almost a direct metaphor to the ideas in Oppenheimer’s brain - specifically in regards to the bomb itself. As more ideas are churned through at Los Alamos the film continues to find itself narrowing in direction until the precipice is reached with the bombs inception (pardon the pun). 
Then following the nuclear test, the film branches into many sects - following; the hearing, trial, aftermath, Oppenheimer’s mental state and his relationships. All at the same time. The chaos almost begins to ensue - this chaos bares a remarkable similarity to the chain reaction involving the neutrons referred to multiple times in the film - the world ending version of the nuclear explosion. Then during the climax of the film it is revealed that Oppenheimer himself realised that the bomb was never truly the evil, but it was those who were willing to use it who were. Creating almost this ironic plot twist that whilst there was an “almost zero” chance the bomb would lead to the end of the world due to the physical aspects of it, there was nearly an “almost certain” chance the world would be brought to its knees as a result of the political and power grabbing plays that are a part of human nature - in effect replacing the neutrons responsible for the chain reaction with people.

The idea a director, big Chris, was able to convey these levels of detail through an overarching narrative is absolutely bonkers. I’ve seen films where directors may have managed it for a scene or two to convey basic feelings of fear, or amusement etc - but never have I seen it portrayed on as grand a scale as Oppenheimer. 


I know that some people will talk about how Emily and Florence as characters should have been explored more, but I disagree. Primarily for the reason that the coloured scenes were supposed to be first person (from Oppenheimer’s perspective). He was described as a womaniser and insubordinate and therefore I believe the representation of those women on screen was probably in line with how Oppenheimer saw them himself.


I think this is probably one of the single best films I have ever seen in my life and would urge anyone to go and watch it",2023-07-25 03:15:52
"Kinda surprised by the fact that I like indiana jones 5 better than this one.

"Even in Oppenheimer, Nolan needs to use ""over the top"" score and sounds to make drama/dialogue more engaging which should otherwise come off naturally as a product of well written script.

Performances were solid. Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. were particularly great but their characters weren't really compelling at all to me.

Flow of the narrative was terrible but some people like that non-linear approach.

Sound design was great , I could almost feel shock wave hitting my chest.

Tad disappointed not to get a bit more from the visual/sound effects.

All that to say - as a geek who loves ufo lore I absolutely loved all of the los alamos stuff and there were four or five different times where I thought “come on man give us a ufo in the background never addressed!!!”

Thank god he’s too good for any of that schlack but it gave me a good chuckle a couple of times when I really needed one. 

Loved every minute.",2023-07-24 00:17:10
"I thought it was a great drama. Definitely not an action packed movie you'd expect to get from Nolan. I've read American Prometheus so I understood his growing up, professor years, assembling the project, dilemma of dropping or not, and then the political aftermath. But still, it can be hard to follow in the beginning. I thought everyone did a great job. Murphy was excellent. 

My only dislikes, it was hyped up way too much for IMAX movie. Maybe for the sound, but for the visuals, was not that impressed. Could have easily seen this in a regular digital showing. Do I even want to try for a 70mm IMAX showing to compare?

Also, why the unnecessary nudity? Could easily have had sex scenes without straight nudity. If that was the reason for the R rating, kind of pitiful. I don't even remember that much language in the film.",2023-07-24 20:17:50
This movie broke me. Such an experience. 10/10,2023-07-22 05:06:38
"I am not a huge Nolan fan.  A lot of the famously Nolan-like traits of a movie I actively dislike, but this movie was really good.  It didn't feel like a Nolan movie at all.  Sure there was non-linear storytelling, but it was done in a fairly conventional biopic kind of way.  No weird literary device pushing the jumps through time.  And I could hear all the dialogue.

I was also going to say that there weren't a lot of exposition dumps, but maybe it just felt like there wasn't because the plot was so simple and mostly 100% talking.  So basically the whole movie was an exposition dump, and there was no convoluted incomprehensible plot to explain to the audience.  I appreciated that.

The only point that I didn't really like was the use of Rami Malek's character.  He comes out at the end as this surprise witness, and it seems like there should have been a reason for that or some connection, maybe to Strauss's aide or something.  It seemed weird and convenient that this guy showed up to ""save the day"" for no reason.

Overall though it was very enjoyable.  Nothing special.  I don't think it's going to be a cornerstone of cinema like The Dark Knight or Inception are, but Nolan is clearly very talented and I think his talent works great on a straightforward historical movie like this.  Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy definitely carried more than their weight in this, though.",2023-07-23 01:50:03
"Gary Oldman was just unnecessary.  Small part + big star + prosthetics took me out of the movie for that scene. Felt the same about Casey Affleck, but for the different reasons you'd be shocked to see him in a big film like this if the last thing you remember about him was the me too movement. Matt Damon worked hard but he seemed a little out of his depth with the performances turned in by the rest of the cast. Not a mark on him, being the worst player on an all star team is still its' own accomplishment.

these are the tiniest of nits I had to pick about the film. Otherwise it was 3 hours well spent, and thoroughly enjoyed",2023-07-24 19:14:55
"The whole film, I kept thinking that this was a subpar score from Hans Zimmer. Then during the credits, I saw that the score was actually by Ludwig Göransson instead. Presumably because Zimmer is scoring *Dune Part 2* instead?

"Upon further reflection, I think this movie would have been better if it were broken up. It seems that Nolan wanted to tell the story of Oppie's life and trial, which is perfectly fine. So I think this movie would have been far better off as an arthouse a24 type of flick that could focus on his trial and life with flashbacks to the project, rather than trying to fit it into being a blockbuster type of film.


Or, Nolan should have made a movie about life on Los Alamos, making the bomb, the scientists involved and the urgency and desperation they had to finish this thing. The could be a little bit more ""action-y"" in a sense.",2023-07-25 07:11:02

Apart from technical aspects I loved all the artistic choices Nolan made especially not showing direct things like bombings but Oppenheimer's experience right after it. 

The best scene was the gymnasium scene by far. Although I'm not from America I did read about his life to some degree so I wasn't completely in the dark but general audiences would definitely be bored because of not understanding. His story after the bomb had to be shown though, it's a biopic not a movie about the Manhattan project.",2023-07-21 12:06:49
"I cried the first minute when they showed a visual image of Oppie's mind. It reminded me of that scientist in Chernobyl series and beside I'm a sucker of nolan's visualization of abstract. Hell I even cried like a baby when I saw the beauty of black hole.

My favorite sounds effect is obviously during Oppie's speech in a project-manhattan-member only. The split second of a screaming kid is just a cherry on top.

Is it convention at other IMAX theaters for the film to start exactly on time? I recall them not having previews in the past here.

"oppenheimer
ill start with the bad. and then what i like about it
bad: oppenheimer is not a good movie. It felt like i was watching a 3 hour movie trailer. It didnt feel like… a MOVIE. The entire movie was hans zimmer (brilliant score btw) playing awkwardly over people talking. There are no “scenes” in this movie. every “scene” is just 20 seconds of people talking so unnaturally and then skipping to the next scene of people talking like this. no scene has its time to flesh out or be at all intriguing. the movie does a poor job and showing what is happening and when. for example: the part at the beginning with the apple. the first conflict in the movie. lasts literally 2 minutes and it ends awkwardly. not intentionally awkward like it was trying to show an awkward moment. but because the whole dialogue is messy and just put together over the random score. not compelling. this movie is just constantly boring. there were so many “important” characters and big actors in this movie. but i bet most people couldnt leave the theater and name anyone other than oppenheimer and einstein (maybe strause maybe kitty cuz they say them both soooooo much). i dont care about any of the characters. not at all. there was the scene where oppenheimer has a breakdown next to a tree after florence pugh’s character dies (dk her name). his wife confronts him and it looks like its going to be a very evoking scene. so much that can be taken from this. so much that can be done with both cillian and emily’s characters. theres emotions of guilt, remourse, anger, shown through the suicide of this character and betrayal that oppenheimer made. and yet it just gets skipped like many scenes in this movie. and guess what. i doesnt make me care. at all. thats my biggest problems. there are other things too like the stupid dialogue

good: its christopher nolan so it looks great. the visuals i loved. so unique. I know that he did a lot of these no cgi and some of them aspecially the ones at the beginning id like to know which are and are not cgi. its not until the grouo starts experimenting with the bombs that i start enjoying this film becuase its the first time in the movie that it feels like a movie and not a legit movie trailer. the entire scene where they detonate the bomb is great. it builds. it takes its time and it puts the audience in the scene unlike the rest of the movie. (the scene with oppenheimer speaking to the room of happy people as he sees them all explode is also another one of these scenes i loved). and i loved this part of the movie. just spectacular. i was almost brought to tears with how well this scene moved me. but it doesnt stay well for much after. also its worth mentioning i respect that the movie is trying to give justice to what really happened. but then again left out a lot of important details.

This is such an actor showcase type of film. Cillian as Oppenheimer was so seductive in this. Sexually and intellectually. An angle that was kind of unexpected.

So many performances in this & familiar faces that made me go [like this.](https://i.imgur.com/DtnZZ5t.jpeg) Rami Malek, Tony Goldwyn, Jack Quaid, James Remar, James D'Arcy, Josh Peck, - even the music being done by Ludwig Gorranson who scored the NBC show Community.",2023-07-21 12:07:57

Any thoughts on this? Thanks!",2023-08-12 09:47:00

"What do the raindrops stand for?
In the first scene of the movie we see him intently watching raindrops hit a puddle. So with the film opening like this, you would think it has a greater importance.
Later in the movie (atleast to me) it seems clear that the drops and the ripples are a metaphor for bombs covering the earth.
But when Oppenheimer looked at them at the start, this metaphor doesnt work, because he didnt know of the bomb - Infact didnt believe it was possible to make one. 
We know he was scared of the potential of the atom, but that was shown in a different way.

So what does it stand for?

"I’ll start off with what I like.
As always, Nolan has amazing cinematography, especially for showing the force of the bomb.
Murphy gave a great performance and RDJ struggled at first to lose some of the Tony Stark mannerisms, but the scene where it revealed that it was him who screwed over Oppenheimer reminded me that he can act.
My frustration comes from Nolan still going with the “troubled genius” trope he favors over what could have been an excellent thriller. I read Day of Trinity and I enjoyed it more than the movie in terms of story.
Did not appreciate the Casey Affleck casting either.",2023-07-22 07:05:49
"Just finished watching the movie. It's another great masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. However, as others have noted, it's a little too conversationally heavy which made it hard to pay attention. Especially through the thick accents. Not the fault of the movie, as it's trying to be as realistic as possible, but it's enough to warrant a 9/10 instead of the 10/10 it feels like it really deserves.",2023-07-22 18:51:22

Every scene felt like it was 3 lines of dialogue, and each line of dialogue felt like it was meant to blow your mind; except it didn't. This made it feel pretentious. Not the physics or the politics, but the dialogue and cinematography are what made it feel almost insufferably pretentious.

"Not gifted enough to write a good critique, but while I thought it was decent, still felt too long despite what seemed like a very fast pace the whole way through. Also I know it's his thing but the blasting score or sound effects sometimes during dialogue became too much for me, works better on say Interstellar/Inception, not so much a courtroom or study hall, but that's just me..at least dialogue was largely audible this time. I don't remember his earlier movies doing this (Memento and insomnia)? The bomb scene coulda used some CGI enhancement, the real footage is incredible.

Only listed negative but at the same time everything technical was top notch as you would expect from Nolan. Interesting historical plot and story told well. Great acting, star studded.

Probably one of those movies that I won't watch again but 7 or 8/10.",2023-07-22 14:33:08

"Just got back from 70MM IMAX and I’m floored.  Fantastic film beginning to end and Nolan’s and van Hoytema use of the large format is both masterful and breathtaking.  The clarity and depth allow for incredible immersion.  I don’t know that the movie has quite the same level of impact in a smaller format and I’d encourage anyone who can to see it this way.  That being said, if you only do IMAX for big special effects movies and don’t care about stunning vistas, clarity of the minutest of details in frame, or depth, you might be disappointed.  Nolan and van Hoytema use the 70MM format the way it was originally used in semiwide distribution and they do it in a way that few can master.   

Perhaps shockingly, after his last two movies, the sound engineering was incredibly well done and I’ll be shocked if anything comes along that steal the Oscars for mixing, editing, and design.  The cast did an excellent job, which one would expect with a cast of this caliber and with Nolan at the helm.  

My only criticism after an initial view, and these are quibbles: 

1) too often, logistical problems encountered on the Manhattan Project were resolved instantly by a guy sitting in the room.  It was necessary because the actual work would have been tremendously dull and because the movie already had a 3 hour run time, but it happened enough that it took me out of the movie for a second.  Better to have one or two of those problems and the fact that they had been solved mentioned in conversations where a subordinate is reporting on progress to Oppenheimer.

2) Blunt was used a little poorly in a few places, specifically when she would berate Oppenheimer for not sticking up for himself and letting people walk all over him and when she’s pissed about Straus.  Her delivery in those instances were a little too melodramatic compared to everything else in the film.  I don’t think Nolan intended to make me laugh at how preposterous she seemed, but that’s what happened.",2023-07-30 03:16:18
"If I have Oppenheimer at 3:45pm and Barbie scheduled for 7pm, will I be able to pull off Barbenheimer? I scheduled movie tickets for AMC to watch Oppenheimer with my friends at 3:45 pm and Barbie at 7. I would’ve pushed back the time for Barbie but there were no other movie times. Oppenheimer is exactly 180 minutes long but actually it’s around 175 minutes without credits. I predict there to be about 15-20 minutes worth of trailers at the beginning. Which makes its end time around 7. With there to be an expected 20 minutes of trailers before Barbie, this gives us some leeway. Do you think we can pull it off?",2023-08-04 05:45:51

Every actor I enjoy was in it even David Dalmachian (a favorite of DV). Josh hartnett is the most handsome man I’ve ever seen in my life. Florence Pugh is physically perfect and intense. Oh and Matt Damon is literally hilarious like laugh out loud every time he bursts onto the screen. 

The final scene is worth every minute. The 3rd act is dragged through with the confrontation with RDJ. Oh and when the bomb does go off it’s worth every penny you pay in imax.

"As a Canadian, I didn't learn much about the AEC and what happened with nuclear energy after WWII - it was the Manhattan Project, then dropping the bombs on Japan, then the Cold War and mutually assured destruction with Russia. Those scenes fell short for me, just because we had such high stakes with the atomic bombs and then...of course old white men bickering about their political positions and deciding the fate of nations in back room meetings. 

I came out of the movie wanting more Kitty, to see more of how she felt being in the position she was in the 40s and 50s as a woman. She obviously felt powerless and had to choose the role of housewife or scientist. The movie showed us she was very intelligent and it was frustrating to have her relegated to washing sheets. 

Enjoyed the Los Alamos scenes the most and was invested in the Manhattan Project stuff, not so much Oppenheimer himself.

From the technical side, I feel like Nolan heard the criticisms of the sound mixing in Tenet and went FINE, YOU WANT TO HEAR IT 😠? HAVE IT DIALED UP TO 11. My poor ears.",2023-07-25 14:09:41

While I'm disappointed we didn't get to see the nukes dropped on Japan it makes sense within the context of the film so I can't be mad. It was a good movie but at the same time I wish it was told in a linear manner rather than cuts to various points in time which IMO would have made it flow better.

"I’d like to open the discussion to his obviously sentimental consideration of Vishnu’s “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”

To start this discussion, you need to consider 2 things:

1. Age of sanskrit, and considerations/possible bias of the teacher that taught him sanskrit. Considering he was brought up under Judaism, and Vishnu was a god of Hinduism, we can all assume translation of one language to another by an organized religion may introduce bias. 

2. It has been said that “death” also translates from Sanskrit as “world destroying time”, so this fundamentally changes the true foundation of Dr. Oppenheimer’s moral dilemma, no matter how he took it to heart. “I am become death” vs “I am become world destroying time”. One insinuates he is Prometheus, giving man fire. The other insinuates that time/the gods would destroy world regardless, as somehow they’d get fire. I think this has strong parallels to his opinion on the H bomb invented by US vs Russia, the inevitable is inevitable.",2023-07-23 05:27:45

"I went to see a Barbenheimer screening, with Oppenheimer being showed first and I felt that made sense. The only complaint I have about it is that it didn't give you much time to sit in it, you just rushed to the toilet and then for the shop to refill for the next movie. I have teenaged boys so I felt like this was a great opportunity for us to go to the movies together, especially because I never would have ""made them"" see a movie named Barbie otherwise. 



All in all I loved the movie. I didn't see any trailers or anything beforehand, I only knew Cicilian Murphy and Florence Pugh were in it, was pleasantly surprised by all the great actors, especially Robert Downey Jr. His performance was phenomenal, as was Murphy's. However I heard some buzz about Pugh's performance but I felt her character lacked substance which is probably for the lack of writing. 



I especially liked that this wasn't a one dimensional portrayal of Oppenheimer, but showed his complexity, brilliance and flaws. I thought the sound was maybe the theatres problem, but after reading some reviews I agree that it was flawed, I was very thankful for the subtitles especially in the first act because otherwise I wouldn't have cought the dialogue. 



In my opinion the pacing was good, and I was totally invested in the ""trial"" both of Oppenheimer and Strauss. I didn't know much about the history, other than I've listened to some podcast discussions about the ethical questions for making the bomb and Oppenheimer's change of heart. I thought the movie did a good job portraying that. Emily Blunts performance was also excellent and I loved the scene where she ""takes the stand"". That being almost exactly as his actual wife said (if the comments I read are to be believed) just adds to the joy of having watched that scene. 



My boys were overall happy that we went but their qualms about the movie were ""too long and complicated and not enough bomb"" which I find ironic that is the biggest complaint from those who didn't like it. My younger one actually preferred the Barbie movie but I think it was mostly because John Cena was in it (we didn't know). 



I will probably do some historical digging and then watch it again someday. For what it's worth, these two movies got me in theatre which I haven't been to since I saw Once upon a time in Hollywood!",2023-07-25 10:48:03

"I am utterly speechless. Oppenheimer is arguably Christopher Nolan’s greatest achievement from a pure filmmaking perspective and the film of the year by far for me. Really an amazing piece of filmmaking. You need to see this in Dolby Atmos to really get the true weight of the sound design. Film of the year for me 

[Full review](https://boxd.it/4yc5A1)",2023-07-21 04:27:48
"Oppenheimer is among the top three Nolan films for me, and I think it displaces The Dark Knight from the top three.

I was fascinated by the meditative nature of the film and the character study of Oppenheimer, this is definitely different to a lot of Nolan’s most recent films in that it’s more character-driven than his others.

Cillian Murphy was spectacular in his restrained and engaging performance as the titular physicist, and it was really exciting to see him step up to a lead role in a Nolan film and a film in general after being a fan of his supporting roles for many years. The rest of the cast is rounded out well, particularly Robert Downey Jnr, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and even Gary Oldman in his small role as President Truman.

The scene depicting the first test at Los Alamos was brilliantly done with the suspense building up to it and with the accurate depiction of light versus sound speed. And I loved as well seeing the Army trucks carrying the crates which we all know were carrying Fat Boy and Little Boy which while would end WWII would drastically bring the world into the Cold War and the nuclear age.

For me, this is among one of Nolan’s best films and one of the year’s best films.

"What a long-winded, self important blabla fest this movie was. Great for the first hour, with great acting and an accurate depiction on what it feels like to be working in science. But then, when the absolutely anticlimactic poof happens (blink it or you'll miss it), it rapidly goes downhill. 

The movie is almost an hour too long and should have focussed on the lead up to Trinity and maybe beyond, all the stuff about Strauss and Oppenheimer's security clearance was fucking irrelevant.

Nolan needs supervision. The movie felt like a very bad director's cut and could have profitted from rigorous cutting.",2023-08-05 05:55:12

"Oppenheimer isn't that bad as people make it out to be , Christopher Nolan made this movie about Oppenheimer not the Manhattan project ,some may think the trailer is misleading because they though it was only a bomb based movie but also the same about Barbie ,It was not what I expected but that's fine  
  
And I don't ever think that one would make an all talk no action film this interesting to me and people fail to understand if you make a movie about the atomic bomb it's going to be a rant about all the physics that some would never understand or learned, So this is the right way in my honest opinion. I'm not gonna listen to the radiation physics and chemistry like I'm in school again but if there is a movie about Manhattan ,I'll be interest to see how they will not make it boring as the school lecture. so Nolan pulled out some drama and tension to make the 3 hours play time doesn't feel like 3 hours.  
  
so I'll conclude that people who doesn't like this film doesn't like fast pace, the music score on the conversation, the cut, not about the physics on the bomb and how they create the bomb, drama, people who just don't know who Oppenheimer is , people who don't know physics and people who like action movies.  
  
(but still give it a try maybe you like it maybe you don't like it there's not many movie coming out this year might as well embrace it and tell me your opinions later.)  
  
as for me I love it <3 maybe because I use to be a stem student Although I'm now in languages department but I can understand how some people doesn't like it I suggest go watch mission impossible or Barbie but don't bring your kid to Barbie (seriously).",2023-07-24 19:16:23

"Let me start right away with the rating....perfect 10! I honestly can't find any fault. The movie will win best picture, best actor and actress (that hearing scene from her was spectacular) guaranteed. It will have a nomination in every major category, with the director being next likely to win. You could practically nominate 3 or more guys in the supporting role (Jr may very well take it). And, though short, his crazy first love could be nominated for supporting actress. I gotta say, talk about a new dream activated. That sex scene,  though totally unnecessary,  was hot as hell! I will be stopping by the bookstore to get a book on sanskrit  display prominently. The music was outstanding, the sets, the costumes,  the cinematography, the effects were spot on. I can't find a single acting flaw. If there was a movie to point to say the academy needs an ensemble award, this is it. This movie is the best movie I have scene in a very long time.",2023-07-21 19:02:19
"It's not good. It's an hour and a half too long, there isn't even a scene of the actual bombing. There's way too many characters, too much overacting ""THIS IS IMPORTANT"" from Matt Damon and other characters, there's too much sympathizing with Oppy. The final 40 minutes save it from being an outright mediocre movie, but I can't give it more than a 5/10 because of how painfully boring those first two hours were. They focused too much on the melodrama of his personal life instead of the bomb and the aftereffects.",2023-07-22 20:03:47

A constant barrage of largely inaudible, poor dialogs.

To treat such a religious scripture in such a tasteless, borderline blasphemous way is very disrespectful to our culture. I'm not saying there was any malice from Nolan, but it is very ignorant.

"The switching aspect ratios and film stock simply did not work. I don't know why he didn't stick to full imax 70mm the whole time - idk if it was to indicate timelines - but it was so distracting in a film that cut back and forth so much. 

Or did he just not have the budget to do it all on full frame stock. 

As much as i don't care for Nolan i was kinda hopping this would be good but in a lot of ways it worse than i could have imagined - in that it biopic'd harder than any biopic since the mid 00s.

That entire third act focusing on iron man was so weird. Like i get where we land but it was mn't worth the pointless journey. 
 
The film also focusing on the tragedy and destruction of those weapons from the pov of the white man who invented them was... a choice. 

The movie never touches the moral quandry of its bad when Hitler does it but ok when you do it ? That there was no Oppenhitler comparison was weird. Were they so different?

Not worth the hype. Nolan should return to making his awesome staple films like Dark Knight, Prestige, Inception and Interstellar. Not waste time trying to impress the elitist Hollywood circle with WWII films for an Oscar.",2023-08-13 06:37:59

I feel kinda misled by the marketing for the movie because I thought it would be more of a drama and instead it was more like Lincoln (biopic). Just hours of dialogue with nothing really going on on screen. The bomb was cool but it looked kinda fake and was only like a few minutes of the movie. 

And they didn’t show the actual bombings??? Total bait and switch imo


I could tell everyone in the theater after was pretty drained as well, as most people high tailed it out of there right at the first sign of the credits. Lady next to me fell asleep with like 40 min left.

"At the end of this movie I don’t have a sense of who Christopher Nolan thinks Oppenheimer is and as a viewer I found that extremely frustrating. 

The perfect example to me of this is when Strauss makes the point that Oppenheimer doesn’t have remorse for the damage he is responsible for causing to the Japanese I think we the audience are supposed to disagree with his assertion. Yet when Oppy sees visions of the radiation damage it’s not of the Japanese people but only of the largely white people that are around him which to me comes off as proving Strauss’ point. 

I think if Nolan’s view is that Oppenheimer is a complicated individual that’s all well and good but with how poor I found the writing and underdeveloped I found most of the performances I think this movie services less of a  purpose than what a documentary would provide.",2023-08-08 20:35:48

The movie is somehow the worst of all of Nolan's ambitions rolled into on a Peter Jacksonian bloatfest. It somehow takes the confusion of Memento, the bland characterizations of The Prestige, the punishing historical accuracy of Dunkirk, and the soundtrack of Dark Knight Rises and Tenet that is simultaneously unintelligible when it comes to dialogue, and PUNISHINGLY loud when it comes to its over-bloated ambient score. Cillian Murphy disappears into a historical figure that none of us can recognize. . . great. We get to see Robert Downey Jr. without a dye job. Whoa! This movie isn't bad because the subject matter is worth the consideration and the script. This movie is painful to watch because Christopher Nolan left his handprints all over a history that needed to be told.

"Many people can better articulate how great the movie is.  

I just want to state I can't believe some of the mistakes made. We watched it on IMAX in Branson which probably made some more noticeable. 

During the interrogation that happens throughout the film, if you look closely out the windows, sometimes you'll see modern vehicles. I quite clearly saw the front of a newer chevy truck. 

During a scene with writing on a chalk board, you can see they had to redraw it several times while shooting as the circles and letters never match 100%.

"Music playing in the background of scene made for some incredibly cheesy looking dialogue. Also why was every line delivered like it was a live action play? Very weird.

"I noticed that in ""Oppenheimer,"" there were two different pronunciations of Hiroshima: HirOHshima and HiroSHEEma. (I think RDJ used the former and the Defense Secretary used the latter, but I could be wrong about who said what.) I've been unaccountably interested in this for years. Seems like when I was a kid, we learned it as HiroSHEEma, but the HirOHshima pronunciation gained fashion amongst people who wanted to sound smarter.

  
I settled this in my own mind once and for all: In Japan several years ago, we took the train to the actual city, and they announced our arrival over the PA — a Japanese person on the Japanese train — as HiroSHEEma.

The Prestige, Inception, Dark Knight Rises, Tenet, now this -- like dude, is your home life okay? Emma Thomas seems lovely, what's going on? Real talk, he needs to work on that trauma, let go of the emotionally unavailable guys in suits while we're at it too, so we can all just move on. Anyway...

First hour had the amazing pace and excitement of an early Nolan film, 8/10. Second hour lost me a bit with Casey Affleck's sequence, wasn't exactly sure what was going on there, but the test scene is here, so 7/10. Then the movie just completely lost me in the final hour and I didn't care nor want to know anything more at that point. Kinda reminded me of Babylon in that sense where it's like, ""alright, show's over, let's go home now, yeah?"" Barbie suffers an oddly similar fate by giving us way too long of a resolution, but this movie doubles that. I really wanted to like it and Cillian knocked it out of the park, but I don't see myself watching this in full again. It's at least better than Dunkirk (I know, hot take) and Tenet (less of a hot take), so I was satisfied in that regard.

Did anyone else find the 3rd act a little bit tricky to give the respect they deserved? Don't get me wrong I was wholly engaged in the stories being told as the dialogue and narrative were superb, but it almost felt like a long extended epilogue rather than the emotional climax I think it was going for? After the ""success"" of the bomb, the stakes really didn't feel as high watching the story of 2 men's reputations/careers in jeopardy. Maybe I'm asking too much of a biopic, they're of course restricted by their source material, but at least to me the third act felt a little unnecessarily drawn out. I think I might've cut Strauss's confirmation at the very least, Oppenheimer's security clearance review is obviously very relevant.",2023-07-21 07:44:16

I watched it yesterday. It is a fantastic movie. There are several things that I enjoyed - the quality of acting from actors, how multiple timelines were intertwined together, cinematography and quality of scenes. Movie did a good job of moving around the central element of Oppenheimer work on the atomic bomb while he was haunted by his past. However, what I don't understand is why there was a need for a sex scene and nudity. What do they add to the movie? Sex and nudity feels like Nolan's desire to add some superb spice to his cooking that does nothing but further confuses people.

When I finally left the theater about 1/5 of the people were sound asleep or just waking up.

"I felt the movie could have ended when Truman kicked Oppenheimer out of his office. The story of the bomb is drama enough for the big screen. But to tell the story of the development of the bomb is a purely mechanical function -- something a history channel writer could do. To make a drama about the lives of the people involved in the bomb is to assert oneself as a Hollywood artist. When the movie kept going, I sat forward on my chair because the director was about to reveal his vision of the film. 

It's important we understand what biases are motivating our storytellers because the stories that we believe in are the stories that become real. 

Nolan included the part about the trial of Oppenheimer because he wanted to ""make his mark"" as a big, important, artistic director yet only achieved a permanent archive of himself, as wholly prey to the spell of the Patriarchy. In relief to Greta Thunberg's film we can see Oppenheimer for what it is: Ken in a nutshell; unwilling to deal with his male woundedness and, when offered the illusion of control through his ability to look big and scary and important, he seized it, like the big mediocre baby-in-a-mans-body he is. To me the movie exists only to increase the impact and urgency of Barbie in that it emphasizes the imperative of understanding the Patriarchy and mechanisms by which it exerts its control. The sooner we remove the investment of our belief into the patriachy and its progenitors in our elected offices and vote into office feminist representatives as Barbie encourages us to do, the more likely we are to avert the kind of destruction Oppenheimer reminds us the Patriarchy will be helpless to preventing itself from committing.",2023-08-21 01:39:49

"Is that me or the barbieheimmer is diluting the Oppenheimer movie and avoids talking about the difficult history subject of the japan bombings? Seems like Barbie comes at the right time for people to forget about, YOU KNOW, nuclear war and glassing civilians (hello ukraine).

It seems so surreal, just to put those two movies next to each other and just make a meme out of it. Japanese people and historians might be a bit confused about all that.

So yes, I feel like I bring down the mood saying that, and I knew that someday I would get old and be confused about how the world is changing, but damn, I was not expecting THAT:

"They really should have stressed Oppenheimers moral dilemma more through the movie and made more about that. We also didn’t actually get a real “I have become death destroyer of worlds” moment with Oppenheimers cold eyes.

"this shit aint elvis lol

what made the framing device in elvis work is that its from the  perspective of someone who won. in this you can not only feel the slime off rdj's character off the jump, you can also smell a loser. the camera is never in his control. nolan could't land the memento kickflip here and i honestly think it might be (or at least a major contributing factor might be) because he replaced the phone from memento with a guy with a punchable face that actually has lines and backtalks rdj.

 also: the lack of smoke is fucking criminal. this is a hard r movie about a guy who dies of cancer, not from the radiation like some people he hired to actually build the bomb, but from throat cancer from his constant smoking. he should look super cool and die in pain and anguish like a dog

also: suspicious minds (vegas mix) > trinity test, and yes they are the exact same scene",2023-07-21 12:02:27

"I feel like a lot of people who had a problem with the pacing didnt fully grasp the idea of the movie.
To me, the pacing perfectly matches the way Oppenheimer probably viewed his experience during the era, which is what makes this movie really standout to me. 
From a young student traveling through Europe, meeting all these great people to his rapid involvement in the Manhattan project to being just as quickly cast aside (which slams home the last point Einstein made at the end of the movie).
It couldve been a wonder story or a much darker one but that would twist reality.
Oppenheimer is a gray story where right and wrong is supposed to be muddied and we simply get a view of the way Oppenheimer experienced it all.
8.5/10 Movie for me, not perfect but I dont think it couldve been done told much better without wandering off from reality too far.",2023-07-22 12:38:58

"I loved this film and other people already praised it better than I can.

However, the scene where Oppenheimer says he has read three volumes of Das Kapital and then quotes Proudhon, not Marx, was cringe. ""Property is theft"" was actually refuted by Marx, not said.",2023-07-21 03:14:42

"This movie was absolutely AWFUL. I’ve seen a lot of shitty movies, but this one blows them out of the water. The bomb was the most anticlimactic thing I’ve ever witnessed- I have seen a grease fire that was more intense. It appeared NOTHING like an atomic bomb. The dialogue was cluttered, chaotic, and uninteresting. The story could have been condensed to an hour and a half. There were several times I considered walking out of the theatre but I kept holding out hope! I have never been so regretful about seeing a movie. This was my first, and my last Christopher Nolan film- even seeing that name is making me irritated after having been put through that. 3 hours of my life down the drain",2023-08-03 02:47:52

"Not so sure about this film. Shocked to see that Christopher Nolan of course directed and was a producer of the movie, but he was also in fact, the screenwriter for this film. He sure took some liberties on his interpretation of the time. This is a World war 2 movie, yet made zero mention of the terms “Axis and Allies” which I’m not sure how you make a movie about that time without using those terms (who was fighting who). The Allies were the UK, US and the Soviet Union; yet he made the whole movie about communist Russia which wasn’t even a thing then or even called that at that point; and the problem was with Germany, Japan & Italy (Axis countries). It was the Soviet and they were a U.S. ally. Shocked there was no showing in the entire movie of Japan; they couldn’t even say a little blurb at the end about the 200,000 people who were killed by this bomb. I’m sure Japan, as our friends now, must love that our biggest grossing film is glorifying one of their saddest days, without any mention of their people. The movie even admits it was unnecessary to do that to Japan; and really shoud’ve been made in time to bomb Germany/Hitler instead. That movie was a mess of characters who the audience is unsure exactly who each random scientist and politician is exactly. Nolan spent the wrong amount of time on the wrong subjects of this film on Dr. Oppenheimer.",2023-07-24 04:35:10

"Saw it in IMAX 70mm as Nolan intended.

why did he not put in an opening scene or require trailers. The movie started on time and dived straight into the plot.
If he's such an avid theatre goer, he would know there's always people who show up late shuffling into their seats. I missed a bunch of the beginning. I wonder when was the last time Nolan went to a normal movie theatre.

edit: i didn't show up late. other people did. when they shuffled to their seats, i missed a bunch of the beginning. funny how people thought i was late. if i was late, i would've said i was late or i missed the beginning. how could i see some of the beginning but missed parts of it. also, if i was late, how would I know the movie started on time and dived straight into the plot.",2023-07-22 01:30:30

So much talking.   This doesn't pass the airplane test.   If this was playing on a plane and you didn't have headphones, could you follow it?

"Can someone who's knowledgeable about films educate me on the choice of having characters doing close-ups, solo, but having just an ear in focus while they're speaking? It felt like a mistake. I just didn't understand why so much blurriness! Then after 10 seconds the actor would move a little and get in focus, and their ears out of focus. I thought that was shitty cinematography, but maybe I'm wrong.

It reminds me of amateur photographers who shoot wide open on an aperture 2.8 and don't get the whole person's face in focus but it's artistic and they think they are now a professional headshot expert.",2023-07-21 03:23:32

How loud would you say the film was? Obviously, the bomb scenes are going to be loud, I know that, but am I right in thinking that that's quite a small part of the movie, near the start? Is the volume loud for other scenes as well?

I'm wanted to take my OH to see it, but he has sensitive hearing. He had to leave the cinema during the last film we saw (Jurassic World: Dominion, please don't judge.

Though chronologically, Oppie's security clearance inquiry was in 1954, and Strauss' Senate hearing was in 1959.

I too was guilty of thinking they took place side by side, only reading afterwards that they took place years apart (enough time for the scientists to develop a grudge against Strauss to oppose his appointment as Secretary of Commerce), as typical of Nolan's non-linear narrative style.",2023-07-27 13:09:15

To me that felt more than just a ""fuck you moment"" but sort-of the message of the movie about not basking in self-importance. Einstein tells Oppenheimer after that scene that when people give him awards and medals, they don't give them to him but to themselves.

"Thing is they were talking about something more important *AND* Lewis Strauss. Einstein hated the idea of Tellers' Super, and Strauss greatly helped it's development. The side eyes are real.",2023-07-23 12:44:42
"Alden Ehrenreich was low key the standout performance for me. RDJ and Murphy were the stars and they delivered Oscar worthy performances. But Ehrenreich REALLY stood out in a sea of talented ensemble performances. And there were a LOT of great performances in that ensemble. I know his career stalled a little after Solo, but I’d love to see more of him.",2023-07-24 20:26:00
Looooved that line delivery so much. RDJ & Alden played off each other so well,2023-07-23 05:33:54
"Narcism, paranoia, and hypocrisy are a contagious poison in our society… always seems like they go hand in hand with power",2023-07-26 14:11:56
Can’t believe Han Solo told that to Iron Man. Crazy movie,2023-07-22 22:03:33
"This is demonstrated throughout the entire movie with the color scheme. Oppenheimer saw the big picture, the world in color. Strauss saw only his own ambition, a world of black and white.",2023-07-30 04:31:48
Spelling it out and then showing it felt too repetitive and on the nose to me.,2023-08-06 04:15:48
Written and delivered with the skill of a high school kid’s English essay.,2023-08-01 23:36:31
"And they were. A great prelude to the closing scene, which was a great haymaker to make it all stick with you",2023-07-26 05:47:59
It was the wrong character to deliver that line imo. It was a little jarring and unrealistic for an aide to just do a complete heel turn and shit on the person he’s working for. I get that characters are nuanced but it happened too quickly for it to be earned.,2023-07-22 12:01:22
"I was slightly confused by that scene because it was a flashback of the first time they met correct? But Oppenheimer referenced the calculations that said they may destroy the world; but that didn’t happen until after they started working at Los Almos, correct? Was it not a flashback? Are my timelines off?",2023-07-23 23:15:50
RDJ is pure brilliance,2023-07-23 00:16:42
I know it was meant like it. But he spoke of Albert never looking at him after that and other scientists being against him too. Was it mean to be just all imagined?,2023-07-25 17:44:09
I knew he was in this movie but I didn’t know who he played. It wasn’t until like his 5th time on screen before it hit me. He disappeared in the role. He’s so good.,2023-08-10 16:34:18
I was listening to a podcast where they were saying that this story of a great man creating something that ended up destroying the world is kind of like Christopher Nolan making Batman which started an era overrun with superhero movies. So it’s funny to see Christopher Nolan put RDJ in this role.,2023-08-14 03:42:39
He was great but the last 10 mins or so with him pacing and wagging his finger like a pantomime villain were a little histrionic.,2023-07-26 22:14:49
"I loved that at the end. As an even bigger fuck you, I would’ve liked it if they didn’t actually show the scene. It didn’t occur to me until the very end that all his spite came from him thinking that Oppenheimer and Einstein wear talking shit about him. He really is self important",2023-08-04 01:40:15
agreed,2023-07-23 01:48:55
"Some directors have that pull, Wes Anderson and Tarantino are the same. Just been in a Nolan film even if it's a 5 minute role, is something as a actor you want to tick off the bucket list.",2023-07-21 03:50:29
I thought Casey Affleck was riveting in his one major scene. He looked like he wanted to rip Oppenheimer's skin off.,2023-07-21 22:18:16
">Gary Oldman

For fucks sake, I just found out he played Truman. That fucking chameleon keeps fooling me!",2023-07-22 22:14:17
"Rami was perfect casting. He's a born character actor, such a jarring presence on screen, steals the movie when he leans into stuff like this",2023-07-22 01:12:47
Affleck nailed anti-communist freak he played.  You can just see the boiling rage in his eyes.,2023-07-23 01:28:19
"Not to mention Kenneth Branagh (two Oscar nominations, two Emmys and a BAFTA for acting).",2023-07-22 20:18:00
Casey Affleck gave me so much anxiety in the few minutes he was used. Real strong killer energy,2023-07-23 06:56:46
It really shows not only the pull that Nolan has but the ability to build great relationships with the crew that want to come back consistently. The actors just know that Nolan won’t waste their small amount of screen time but instead give them meaningful lines even if it’s only for a couple of minutes,2023-07-22 09:01:09
"Rami Malek initially kinda stuck out but by the end i saw why he was cast. The film does that with some of these characters, even Jason Clarke’s role is initially a little dry but at the end it’s much more standout and pointed.",2023-07-22 18:12:09
"Gary Oldman was in this?

Oh my god I didn’t recognize him at all as Truman.",2023-07-22 23:55:27
But they were very captivating in their scenes.,2023-07-21 04:06:48
"Rami Malek is in two scenes where he has no dialogue at all and then gets brought back at the end, which I guess is kind of foreshadowing because why would you hire Rami Malek just to make him an extra",2023-07-23 08:54:23
Holy shit Casey too??? At this point I'm wondering if I'll be blessed with an Interstellar reuinion,2023-07-21 04:14:16
Affleck’s scenes were chilling.,2023-07-23 02:10:33
"But every single part for them was important.  Sometimes it’s not how many scenes you get it’s the quality of the scene you do get. 

Props for Malek too. He looked like a bit character up until the board hearing g and then he puts Strauss on full blast and eviscerates him publicly.",2023-07-23 10:59:27
Casey Afflec was TERRIFYING in this. My God.,2023-07-23 23:24:26
I never thought that Casey fucking Affleck would have me scared of him. Such a short scene but he owned the room and made me forget that Oppenheimer WASN’T tortured. Because that dude definitely does some torturing.,2023-07-26 14:35:36
Rami Malek's character was a fucking gem,2023-07-22 12:07:17
I felt like there were so many recognizable faces here. Dane Dehaan and josh hartnett also.  The bad guy from stranger things.  One of the safdies.  Florence pugh.  Chris nolan can get whoever he wants for any size part.,2023-07-26 02:25:04
"And several actors prominent in the advertising had basically no dialog, specifically I noticed Josh Peck and Jack Quarid have almost nothing to say outside of some simple yes/no responses",2023-07-24 03:18:57
"I was surprised to see Rami Malek, and also Jack Quaid too (The Boys, Lower Decks)! Lots of well known actors for small roles in this movie.",2023-07-24 20:02:48
"My thought was they need to have ""Best Actors"" now for lengths of time one screen:

* Under 15 mintues 

* 15 to 30

* 30 to 45

* 45 to an hour 

* etc.",2023-07-23 02:29:18
Ex NHL enforcer Sean Avery had as much screen time lmao,2023-07-23 05:39:40
And Rami killed it in that testimony scene. Here I was thinking that his character was just some kind of goofy fly on the wall and the he comes up and busts the nomination up for Strauss.,2023-07-24 03:30:34
"Wow, once again, I didn’t even realize that was Gary Oldman",2023-07-24 04:58:45
And Remi especially hit it out of the park. He played a crucial role in the film and drove it home beautifully.,2023-07-26 16:10:22
"Aaand this is how I learned that Oldman was not only in the film, but that he played Truman.  He can really disappear into roles like no other",2023-07-28 16:09:11
Diom Waiters award,2023-07-22 14:38:09
Wait where was Gary at?,2023-07-23 07:16:44
"I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop with Rami’s character. Especially after Sean Avery—arguably the biggest shitheel in NHL history—got a few lines as the weather guy, and Malek had still not uttered a single word yet. Like how can Avery get more lines than a literal Oscar winner? Was pleased with the eventual reveal of his role at the hearing.",2023-07-30 02:07:45
GARY FUCKING OLDMAN WAS TRUMAN?  Holy shit I never would have recognized him lol.,2023-08-06 06:17:03
All three did great in their small roles though,2023-07-23 19:05:41
"Florence Pugh got like 5-10 minutes and a couple of reviews I saw said they wasted her by having most of her time in a nude scene. You look at the rest of the cast though, and it’s impossible to make time for everyone.",2023-08-01 01:23:39
"Wait, Casey & Oldman was in the film?",2023-08-02 13:18:45
"As a big mr robot fan, I was pissed when Rami didn’t have any lines. THEN BAM. He plays one of the biggest roles in the movie",2023-08-13 06:48:32
"It also helps they though they weren't on screen long, they were all given absolutely critical and crucial moments to shine.",2023-07-24 23:08:53
Wait Gary oldman was in this? Lol,2023-07-27 00:13:43
I didnt realize gary oldman was in the movie,2023-07-28 06:44:33
Yeah and all of them are hidden beneath Josh Pecks enormous shadow,2023-07-29 06:19:30
I didn’t realize Oldman was Truman until the credits.,2023-07-29 21:52:59
Just realizing now that was Gary Oldman. Holy shit that guy is a chameleon.,2023-08-08 19:24:46
"To be fair, all 3 were pretty pitch perfect in their roles.  
Oldman was an absolute delight when he showed up.",2023-08-09 23:43:46
Rami Malek was literally featured extra until his Senate hearing scene.,2023-08-14 03:44:21
"Yea but then you get bum actors like Sean Avery, former NHL player who have no acting skills at all.",2023-08-15 20:36:57
Lmfao fuck Casey affelck,2023-07-24 02:08:19
"Maybe I’m in the minority, but I dislike when movies have casts like this. I find it to be more of a distraction than it’s worth to keep having big stars drop in for a couple minutes.",2023-07-22 20:52:55
Who did Casey Affleck play? Didn't recognise him,2023-07-29 21:59:40
Probally filmed a ton more,2023-07-30 11:09:32
Reminded me of the mainstream actors appearing in 1917,2023-08-04 09:13:59
Raaaaami,2023-08-18 06:00:16
"Dude I know it's been 49 days since your comment, but *damn*, I absolutely loved Casey Affleck in this. He didn't say much but he was so menacing, great short performance",2023-09-08 16:21:52
"Well, it's Nolan.",2023-11-20 03:52:07
Truman: …..pussy,2023-07-22 01:45:39

Bring back the intermission.,2023-07-23 08:45:38
Gotta make sure not to consume too much liquid prior to long films. Will have to do the same once Killers of the Flower Moon opens with its 3.5hrs.,2023-07-23 04:43:57
"I made it to 2h28, missed about two minutes, no regrets.",2023-07-22 20:38:30
In India we get a break at middle of the movie for 10 minutes to pee and buy popcorn,2023-07-27 20:17:34
Salty snacks and limited water,2023-07-23 01:46:45
"I had an older couple beside me who had to talk or be on their phone the entire damn time. And elbow me every few minutes. My theater was packed, so I was stuck. But now I have an excuse to see it in IMAX.",2023-07-22 05:59:02
He should have use RunPee,2023-07-23 14:55:16
Some woman at my showing got up like right before the countdown for the Trinity test and walked in front of me as the bomb was going off,2023-07-25 13:05:54
Proud to tell that I made it those 3 hours and then also the 15 more mins walk back home,2023-07-26 07:10:01
I saw someone come back right after the Trinity scene. Big goof.,2023-07-23 18:38:34
"The person next to me ducked out right after Trinity, I suspect she Googled when to go beforehand.",2023-07-29 21:56:53
About 2 hrs in I knew I was sitting there for the whole time having to pee,2023-07-23 21:29:48
Lmao this is why i dont eat or drink during the movies,2023-07-24 02:39:09
"y'all need to lobby for intermissions, we get them even for 90 minute movies",2023-07-25 22:38:32
"Makes me think of interstellar. I had to pee once the rocket took off. Not, I noticed something, more like hey man you should go. By the end of the movie my bladder was screaming at me, foot shaking dance and all. Once the title popped on the screen, I sprinted to the bathroom. Ain't no fucking way I'm missing anything in a Nolan film. Especially with this type of build up.",2023-07-26 07:39:01
Our showing literally blacked out in the court scene towards the end where Oppenheimer was talking about the 2 scorpions fighting. A solid 5 minutes of darkness and only the audio playing. The perfect pee break window.,2023-07-26 12:44:40
"I'm glad we have intermissions/intervals for every movie here in India, no matter how long. A 10min break for you to do whatever, until the movie resumes.",2023-08-12 07:09:06
"I just got out of watching it, i still haven’t went to the bathroom, the line at the theater when it was over was stretching out to the other side of the room",2023-07-25 22:21:19
The RunPee app is very useful for avoiding this.,2023-07-29 02:03:58
That was me lol but I made it back before it ends,2023-08-01 11:39:56
Y’all need to try the RunPee app. It’s easily the best thing for long movies and even comes multiple pre options and a timer that follows alongside the movie. Literally I’ll get a buzz on my phone and boom I got 2:30m to go to the restroom and I’ll even get a synopsis of what I missed. It’s great for end credits too.,2023-08-02 02:25:50
I left around that mark. I thought the legal drama in the last hour was tedious and the stakes were maintaining a security clearance. There was really nothing at that point that I felt I couldn’t find on wikipedia. Nolan can get so heavy handed with exposition I get exhausted. Each to their own. Loved 2/3rds of it.,2023-08-02 19:06:49
"Some guy in front of me when for a bathroom break during the scene it shows what Oppie and Einstein really talked about, there isn't really a good time to go in this movie but that was one of the most important parts of the 2nd half!",2023-08-08 12:23:00
"I didn't need to go before it started, but I strained and forced a little out just to make sure it was completely empty.",2023-08-12 06:17:55
"this was 53 days ago, but it was me just today",2023-09-13 03:09:45
People got weak bladders - either piss before the movie starts or maybe don’t buy the 20oz drink if you can’t handle it,2023-08-18 00:05:45
Recommend if anyone takes a piss they do it during the hearing scenes. Important yeah but boring also yeah.,2023-07-23 19:19:44
I went like 30 minutes in because I listened to the dumbass on here that stated there would be no trailers at that the movie had a hard starting time. There was 20 minutes of ads plus like a half hour of trailers. My popcorn was all but gone and my bladder was full by the time Einstein made his first appearance.,2023-07-24 03:46:11
Ehhh they could always just stream it later,2023-07-24 06:31:41
I almost did the same thing glad I held it out,2023-07-24 18:49:31

Krumholtz's transformation surprised me cause I'm watching The Deuce right now and in season 2 he suddenly loses a lot of weight and it's addressed in the show.,2023-07-23 00:00:27
"The subtitle to the film should be: ""I need to check IMDB when this is over.""",2023-08-07 14:37:47
I feel like Krumholtz has looked like that for a while now,2023-07-23 00:47:23
Nolan definitely pulled strings to get the kid from Sex Drive to come out of retirement for this haha,2023-07-26 04:30:59
Krumholtz was inspired in this.,2023-07-25 07:43:05

Commenting late but that to me is what direction actually *is.* You get maybe a few minutes of footage a day, often in front of green screens, and it’s the director who had to see the bigger picture.",2023-08-17 02:04:35
Hey there’s Attlee too.,2023-07-22 08:18:55
"Totally agree. Even Matt Damon’s character seems genuinely frightened of what he is capable of, and Casey nails it with his nonverbal acting, and Cillian nails the unnerved reaction. Fantastically tense scene.",2023-07-22 02:44:31
Funny part is if anyone else was playing Oppenheimer I think that role would be locked in for Cillian Murphy.,2023-07-22 21:22:06
The movie does an excellent job of showing what it’s like to be around these crazy military people and politicians,2023-07-24 22:44:35
I don't which one he was in the movie. Was he the one who interrogated Oppie and was called as the guy who later genocided the bosheviks or something?,2023-07-21 16:15:56
Guy usually goes hard in anything he's in,2023-07-23 01:31:50
The guy he played was involved in cia wetworks after the war,2023-07-24 05:54:13
Casey Affleck was incredibly persuasive in demonstrating sociopathic CA vibes. But Nolan is a genius. The way he made us believe that was by inserting scenes where Oppenheimer and Groves were discussing Affleck’s character. It’s chilling how Nolan can manipulate our minds into believing what he wants us to believe.,2023-07-26 22:58:07
He reminds me of the Willem Dafoe character in The Grand Budapest Hotel haha,2023-07-21 15:04:40
Hugo Stiglitz energy,2023-07-22 14:39:04
He was similar to the KGB leader in Chernobyl. A general air of “I know more than you and I can kill you at any time I want”,2023-07-23 02:38:14
"He reminded me of Daniel Bruhl's character in Inglorious Basterds. Affable, probing, charming. Then say the thing he's waiting to hear and he's shooting you.",2023-07-25 16:51:25
"I felt Casey, Emily Blunt, and Josh Hartnett have aged a lot since we last saw them.  Even Josh Peck.  I get that’s how time works, but it really stood out to me.",2023-07-26 04:52:08
Equally intense as Christopher waltz in inglorious bastards… I felt the same vibes,2023-07-27 22:59:43
He was definitely thinking “Who do I need to kill?” as Oppenheimer spoke.,2023-07-29 21:54:39
He strangely kinda reminded me the FBI agent in season 3 of daredevil,2023-07-22 08:57:50
Late to the party. Just watched it today and I kinda didn't really get why Pash showed up in the first place. Like I only got some gist that there was some intermediary involved and hence he testified against Oppie. Someone care to explain the whole premise more clearly?,2023-07-29 20:17:27
It reminded me of the deleted scene in Nixon with Sam Waterston.,2023-07-22 21:14:41
I was having ‘Jesse James’ thoughts watching Casey pick apart Oppie. So tense. Like Damon joked about ‘oh we’ll just kill him’ but Casey was prolly forreal,2023-08-01 01:53:03
It's really uncanny how creepy he felt with very little over creepiness.,2023-08-14 17:25:34

I thought that scene was extremely cringey. Rolled my eyes out of my head when he started reading,2023-07-25 14:22:01
"""You asked me to come....and I came""",2023-07-28 06:18:48
Nolan turned that into Oppenheimer's safe word,2023-07-25 16:49:14
But in the original Sanskrit.,2023-07-23 23:08:06

"""You don't get to commit the sin and then have the rest of us feel sorry for you for there being consequences.""",2023-07-22 02:34:34
What struck me about the line is it applied not only to the immediate turmoil but also the larger conflict within Oppenheimer,2023-07-22 20:21:02
"It reminded me of a brilliant line for Carmela in the Sopranos

“You are putting me in a position to feel sorry for a whore who fucks you?”

Very similar situation too. Tony’s goomar attempts suicide",2023-07-22 09:01:11
"Sounds like something from BoJack 

""You can't keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay! You need to be better! BoJack, just stop. You are all the things that are wrong with you. It's not the alcohol, or the drugs, or any of the shitty things that happened to you in your career, or when you were a kid""",2023-07-28 08:00:23
"I liked the one where she said something like ""you thought that by letting them torture you in front of everyone else it would absolve you for what you did?""",2023-07-31 21:35:13
Also what was that line at the end that Kitty says after the hearing? “Did you think getting tarred and feathered would make up for what you’ve done?” Really felt like the point of the movie boiled down into one sentence,2023-08-14 11:25:02
Interesting commentary on the man's life in general,2023-07-26 17:31:20
haven't seen it yet so I don't know the context of this scene. What is the sin she is referring to? Oppenheimer's affair?,2023-07-21 20:19:40
"Did she know he was cheating on her with jean, because otherwise that was a horrible reaction to have to someone crying about someone in their life dying",2023-08-30 21:15:55
"I think the quote is interesting, but the way it played out in the movie was really awkward and uncomfortable IMO. Lost a lot of its impact that way.",2023-07-22 09:49:49
Probably inspired by the Sopranos moment when Carmela says “you’re putting me in a position to feel sorry for a whore who fucks you”,2023-07-25 15:15:21
I was absolutely sobbing uncontrollably when he's acknowledging the crowd that are cheering and saying how the only regret he has is not being able to use it earlier while internally everything is silent and he is contemplating the destruction of the bomb. Emotionally draining sequence right there. One of the most memorable and deep emotional moment I have felt in a movie theater.,2023-07-25 09:24:24
"The Trinity test sequence is incredible, but that gymnasium scene is my favorite in the film. Gut-wrenching. Having the two back to back makes for the best 20-25 minutes you'll have in a theater this year.",2023-07-25 17:58:45
I've never seen a better representation for how insane and genocidal Americans can be. The imagery of the flags and basketball hoop juxtaposed with charred bodies and falling ash was so fitting.,2023-08-02 04:36:23
I know sound has always been his thing but this one takes the cake. The ensuing sound of the bomb after the long silence... excellence. Sort of wish I had gone out of my way to see it in a bigger theatre.,2023-08-09 11:21:04
"I would have liked to see the crowd actually turn to ash and bones in his hallucination though. 

Instead we got a chick with some paper glued to her face flapping about.

Movie had a lot of great ideas but just didnt push it far enough",2023-08-04 18:35:30
"Honestly, this movie basically feels like who I imagined Nolan would be after I watched Memento back in the day. Instead, that guy detoured into Batman and big action thrillers and so they gave that guy 100 million to shoot this on IMAX film.",2023-07-22 00:45:36
">Ari Aster like

Yep, it left me disturbed and I still need to unpack why exactly.",2023-07-23 08:11:43
There was almost a jump scare moment there that reminded me of the Mal moment in Inception.,2023-07-25 05:46:08
That part took me out of the movie a bit.  Flo Pugh riding Cillian during the hearing and almost breaking the fourth wall made me chuckle.,2023-07-23 04:14:58
It was incredibly uncomfortable,2023-07-24 22:56:19
"My wife and I were joking after we saw it, last night that only Nolan has the pull to get Florence Pugh to show up only to get naked two times and have recent Oscar winner Rami Malek be in a film for two minutes. So many amazing cameos sprinkled throughout this film.",2023-08-06 13:33:12
"I wish there was an alternative version of this movie that had more scenes like that. I could see someone else having a vision of the story with Los Alamos being the center of this insane, reality-bending nexus of world historical events and the world almost seeming to come apart at its seams.",2023-07-27 04:57:44
"Had zero problem with the naked part, don’t know why everyone is complaining, but her suddenly riding him in the hearing was laughably bad.. like being hit in the head with a wooden spoon.",2023-08-18 21:10:07
"It was so stupid. I suspected that the nudity was going to be completely pointless, and it was. Florence Pugh is such a good actress, she was wasted in this.",2023-07-23 15:18:26
My GF thinks maybe she was murdered,2023-08-28 02:13:39
"Maybe because Midsommar was fresh on my mind because I recently watched it, but in some scenes I couldn’t help myself but seeing Dani.",2023-08-01 04:20:02
I felt it kinda clashed with Hoytema’s realistic-seeming cinematography,2023-07-24 06:38:10
It jumped the shark for me. I straight up laughed when Pugh started making hard eye contact with Emily Blunt.,2023-08-09 13:16:22
"The first sex scene, I was like, “why’s everyone making a big deal about this?” Then later the other scene happened…..",2023-08-24 02:59:37

Tbh I get it like its cool and flashy cinema but Idk",2023-07-24 06:50:18
"> It was almost Ari Aster like.

It was a very “Christopher Nolan” sex scene if that makes sense,2023-07-28 05:05:50
"Yeah there were moments in this movie that were a great mix of surreal and dark, almost had more of a Batman Begins feel when the hallucinogenic gas is released.",2023-08-18 00:17:32
"A lesser biopic would have ended with the real Oppenheimer’s “I am become death, destroyer of worlds” speech. That didn’t happen here.",2023-07-22 01:21:52
A frightening scene that was needed. It’s still shocking to me that a lot of people don’t understand that a nuclear warhead being used means we’re all absolutely fucked.,2023-07-21 18:26:03
that scene gave me absolute chills. once the movie ended my whole theater seemed to be a little shaken up by that especially. a completely full theater that during the previews seemed ready to cheer and have reactions to the movie became dead silent because of how tense the movie was.,2023-07-21 08:05:06
"And when Einstein's expression drops when he realises. Great acting by Tom Conti.

That line had the kind of weight that the ""I was disappointed that you tried"" line from Inception. Boom",2023-07-23 13:40:26
"It was, ""I believe we did"".",2023-07-21 08:44:46
"I honestly felt like crying when it was over, not even completely understanding why, and I’m not one of these people that thinks Oppenheimer is evil and that the US shouldn’t have undertaken the Manhattan Project. 

I feel like because of human nature, atomic weapons were an inevitability, which in a way is even more sad. No one stirs up complex emotional reactions quite like Nolan, at least for me.",2023-07-22 02:31:01
"While the whole movie felt like a documentary masterfully edited, with lines that were said in real life, used from actual transcripts, the last line, the scene at the lake, which is most likely pure fiction, made the movie. Very clever.",2023-07-22 13:34:31
"i thought it was a great scene and ending but i feel im in the minority that it wasn't /so/ powerful and emotionally draining to me because it wasn't saying anything new? i've already dealt with this realization, doesn't make it any less sad, but it wasn't profound or anything. i hear about people leaving the theater devastated but it just wasn't there for me.",2023-07-22 23:27:48
I know what you mean. It felt absolutely devastating and it really makes you feel that Oppenheimer understands that his greatest achievement devastated humanity.,2023-07-22 07:04:39
"It made me tear up. Seeing those warheads. The missiles streaking across the sky. The pullback into orbit with rings of fire spreading out across the globe.

""We're not going to make it, are we. People I mean.""

""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.""",2023-07-26 06:27:39
"What makes that scene more harrowing is we see Oppenheimer directly after it. Whenever he gets a second alone he thinks about the chain reaction he might have caused. I never thought Nolan would beat the ending sequence to Inception, but this did it. I had that thousand yard stare for the first twenty minutes of Barbie. They will study this film for years to come. It’s every trick Nolan has learned along the way, masterfully put to use.",2023-07-23 09:55:41
This is why Barbie second is the right order.,2023-07-25 04:29:09
This. The Twitter rhetoric made this movie seem soulless. I think Nolan pretty clearly imprinted the weight of the subject matter,2023-07-25 10:37:57
Remind me - what scene was this in context of?,2023-07-23 00:08:08
"It was such a powerful moment especially knowing it isnt some fiction but a reality we live in.

We never know one day we suddenly live in a nuclear hellscape because of the stupid nations made one mistake and already know how much close encounters and false alarms in history where the US and USSR/Russia almost exchanged nukes.",2023-07-25 00:02:58
"Just an absolutely stunning ending. Nothing more satisfying than being in the end of a film and knowing exactly the perfect ending one step ahead of what they’re showing that they’re setting up and watching them fucking nail it.

People rail on Nolan for incomprehensible dialogue or making movies that are explained more visually than logically but being on the same wavelength as what he’s doing is wonderful. I don’t fault anyone for not jiving with it but I’m glad that I do.",2023-08-13 05:02:44
"It is stark, but I found it not really scaring me since we’re driving ourselves to extinction with climate change and that killing is seems much much more likely and likely to happen much sooner",2023-07-22 22:49:12
In the beginning of the movie we started with just one ripple as Einstein was throwing rocks in the water but at the end it was the entire pond as the rain fell.,2023-07-22 03:30:13
"I think the water ripples on the map appear shortly after someone says “we either drown in 10 feet of water or 10,000 feet, it makes no difference”. Not sure if it was intentional or not but cool detail",2023-07-22 04:40:40

"The best part is... it's factually accurate. Whole parts of that scene were actual quotes.

>“Chairman Gray: “Would it be fair to say that Dr. Oppenheimer’s contributions in the years as late as possibly 1942 meant that he had not stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party? I don’t insist that you answer that yes or no. You can answer that any way you wish.”

> Kitty Oppenheimer: “I know that. Thank you. I don’t think that the question is properly phrased.”

> Chairman Gray: “Do you understand what I am trying to get at?”

> Kitty: “Yes; I do.”

> Chairman Gray: “Why don’t you answer it that way?”

> Kitty: “The reason I don’t like the phrase ‘stopped having anything to do with the Communist Party.’ . . . It is because I don’t think Robert ever had anything to do with the Communist Party as such. I know he gave money for Spanish refugees; I know he gave it through the Communist Party.”

>[...]

>Kitty did not give an inch. Not even Robb could touch her. Calm and yet alert to every nuance, she was undoubtedly a better witness than the husband she was defending.

"One of the reviews said her character didn’t amount to much, but I feel like this scene was one of the best payoffs of the movie",2023-07-21 16:45:11
"I liked it, too. She had mostly been shown as an emotional drunk all movie and then eviscerated that man and completely redeemed her character in that scene and the remainder of the film. I like that she didn't shake hands at the end either.",2023-07-21 22:54:10
"Emily Blunt is the textbook example of how to play a bad bitch. A Quiet Place, Edge of Tomorrow, esc. The lady can act.",2023-07-21 09:30:47

One of the best scenes in the whole thing tbh. Every other scene she was in felt pretty standard but that was the one sequence where she really shined.,2023-09-04 05:26:58

"Eh, I didn’t like it particularly. I don’t think it achieved its aim. Maybe that’s how exactly it happened (they have the transcripts) but I don’t think they really did a great job of making us give an ounce of shit about her character",2023-07-22 07:10:02

"Yeah it was chilling but also a really cool out of body experience where I could almost feel what those scientists felt back then. I was thinking to myself watching that scene, that this is probably the closest we may ever get to seeing and experiencing what it would have been like at the bomb test. To see how people who were at a moment 80 years ago may have reacted is an interesting part of history that I have never really experienced before. And then the celebrations afterwards I honestly felt somewhat relieved too like I was glad on the scientists behalf that all this hard work they were putting in came to fruition, even if they had just designed a nuclear bomb. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's pretty cool to be able to experience the past like another bystander at the bomb test through a movie.",2023-07-29 06:09:53

But just as often he seems to distrust his audience's intelligence and drowns his scripts in exposition, overexplaining concepts and motivations or hit you in the face with the most on-the-nose 'get it?' scenes possible.

Obviously Nolan believes Struss was involved in the JFK assassination as revenge for voting against him 🤣,2023-07-23 01:28:00
It was kind of funny the writing style of this I saw shadows of the dark knight and inception. It had this epic superhero quality but it was a historical account. It did make JFK seem like a foreshadowed superhero,2023-07-27 00:24:34
Because JFK shows up in the end credit scene.,2023-07-22 12:21:13
"There were some UNREAL clangers in this film, this and the first reveal of 'i have become death, destroy of worlds' were the sort of thing a high school freshman writes.",2023-07-22 14:08:56
There’s a signal in the noise,2023-07-21 04:00:19
Only bad part of the film for me. I half expected a post credits scene showing JFK and teasing it as Nolan’s next movie. I bet it is anyway!,2023-07-22 11:37:24
"Classic Nolan-ism. Just like showing us the ending in the beginning parts of the film. (TDKR, Inception, The Prestige)",2023-07-24 01:49:09
"Nolan did the same thing with Oppenheimer in TENET, who knows maybe his next movie will be about JFK",2023-07-25 06:05:06
This and JFK would be a GOAT double feature,2023-07-24 10:51:53
"You could totally watch JFK after this too, script wise this is very similar and even somewhat stylistically.",2023-07-22 18:06:14
It almost felt like Strauss in his true petty form wanted to go after whoever didn’t vote for him and when I heard JFK my first thought was OMG ASSASSINATION.,2023-07-25 17:24:16
Because vindictive government spooks like Strauss killed him.,2023-07-26 03:23:49
"You should use your full name. I like that name, John F Kennedy.",2023-08-07 06:53:35
Imagine a Dunkirk style high-tension movie about the Cuban missile crisis.,2023-08-15 06:47:13
"Haha, I loled at that dialogue so hard. Ridiculous tease indeed.",2024-04-04 18:03:46
"A nod to the movie “JFK,” which inspired Nolan.",2023-07-23 12:39:04
"LMAO. you win the Internet, good citizen",2023-07-21 06:20:38
"Already too many JFK flicks done and out there. Then again Batman.....He should do a proper Cold War movie, a Forrest Gump drama turned to 11 and space lasers.

Them again, would be cool to start down a path of a cinematic uni of these nutty Physicists. All trying to end the world w/their crazy experiments.",2023-07-22 19:28:58
"Because Nolan peaked at the Batman movies, and he knows it.",2023-07-22 00:32:51
"JFK gave him the fermi award, but I agree. Felt weird.",2023-07-21 12:47:23
I find it’s more similar to the robin reveal in Rises,2023-07-22 03:18:31
old habits die hard,2023-07-23 06:59:44
Setup for the Cuban Missile Crisis sequel,2023-07-23 08:41:32
Oppenheimer II: Bigger Boom Boom,2023-07-23 19:55:53
"lol 

That’s what I thought, too. It would be fitting for Nolan to have a sequel for this film, but about JFK.",2023-07-24 03:38:30
Reminder me of the “Robin” name drop.,2023-07-24 05:17:48
Lmao yeah,2023-07-24 23:58:29
"Maybe he is a bit of a JFK fan, I feel he is overrated",2023-07-25 17:36:10
"Because he knew everyone would be all ""😀😏😉""",2023-08-03 04:08:46
Aww it with a bunch of boomers in MA. Theater fucking erupted when he said that.,2023-08-13 22:44:04
"""Do you wanna know how I got these scars?""",2023-08-14 09:52:31
Because Strauss had JFK killed obviously.,2023-08-21 12:45:36
"I didn't even know he was a senator from Massachussets, and I immediately thought of him when they talked about a ""young politician trying to make a name for himself"".",2023-12-09 14:06:06
just watched it in theaters and someone clapped when they said his name,2024-01-27 05:39:59
"IDK about anyone else, I absolutely love Damon, but I tend to always have trouble separating his characters from him. Like every time he's in any scene in any movie by brain won't stop saying ""Hey look it's Matt Damon lol!"" - like he's a meme created by nature.",2023-07-21 04:02:52
"Damon is so great and he usually is, it’s amazing how good everyone else was that Damon is taken for granted. Truth be told, I’m amazed that he didn’t even come up in my discussion with my friends on the way out.",2023-07-21 07:12:53
Damon was on point… I just think his “really great” performance is gonna get lost amongst 2-3 “career defining” performances in this movie,2023-07-21 19:35:38
"He did an incredible job, but it was a hilarious example of upping the attractiveness for a movie.

Leslie Groves…did not look like that, in any number of ways.",2023-07-21 12:20:20
"I also hadn't heard him discussed, so I assumed his role was a bit overshadowed. After watching it, I think he was one of my favorite characters. 

Strong, direct, focused, honest, and kept his word. Also, after his ""interrogation,"" when he was leaving the room, Oppenheimer looked the most emotional from his responses. There is also that brief scene before the test where he jokes around with Oppenheimer. There was more depth shown here than the normal jarhead army guy we see.",2023-07-21 23:10:05
Matt Damon has done his share of phoned in movies but he’s an incredibly good actor when he’s on - and he’s always best when he plays assholes and villains IMO.,2023-07-21 19:54:45
Man i really wish Matt Damon and Casey Affleck shared a scene.......LIKE COME ON!!! lol,2023-07-21 08:05:05
"yeah he was great. His role wasn't 'sad' but he plays that general marvelously. I liked his performance more than RDJs to be honest, because it was a more complex role imo",2023-07-21 08:44:54
"For one of the biggest stars in the film, his performance as Leslie Groves was great to watch.
I initially expect him to play him as the typical no nonsense authority figure trope but I was pleasantly surprised how Leslie, even with his abrasive and brusque attitude, he respects Oppenheimer and the scientists’ efforts while giving them the resources needed. 

Another thing I like to add: It’s always good and a joy to see Matt Damon in this continuing trend of playing a character that has to keep the character actor in check all while dealing with a European competitor",2023-07-21 17:45:14
"> Haven’t seen anyone talk about Matt Damon yet

Damon was right: it's the best movie he's ever been in. 

I'd also argue that it's one of Downey's best performances too.",2023-07-22 05:11:35
He brought a much needed wholesomeness to the film.,2023-07-21 09:24:28
"I actually had a real hard time with Matt Damon in this film, his presence as Matt Damon (like he couldn't shake it off and act) kept taking me out of the film and I kept thinking about Matt Damon in those scenes instead of the film. I wish someone else had been cast. Overall I enjoyed the film, but not one of Nolan's best.",2023-07-22 02:34:28
"Dude was great, not as corny as the trailer at all. I felt the movie actually started when he walked on screen, everything before that was borderline cringe and goofy.",2023-07-21 07:59:21
"Same, I think Damon did amazing job and really escaped from being just him playing some other dude",2023-07-21 06:40:08
"Ok I don’t know if it was just me but every time Damon came on screen I was cracking up. I think he was playing it up, just screaming every time playing the stereotypical general. But seemingly much like the man there was more to him and maybe all the yell and bluster was an act, he was actually very effective when he was being.

I felt kind of bad laughing so loud cause no one else was, it reminded me of “Vince it’s for the kids !” Or his freak out in 30 rock when the plane is delayed and he’s playing the pilot.",2023-07-21 13:14:01
He played a similar role to his other movies but it worked well here as he was well utilized.,2023-07-21 19:09:15
"I agree. From the trailer I thought he'd be kinda mid at best, but he was actually really good.",2023-07-21 21:15:45
"Matt Damon's delivery of ""I said Allegedly"" was the best quip joke since ""there must be some sort of double standard for this"" in the French Dispatch",2023-07-23 20:43:57
WTF WERE YOU  DOING IN CHICAGO,2023-07-23 07:19:52
His brief line from the trailer about it being the most important thing in the history of the earth came off a lot better in the context of the scene.  He’s being shown as a somewhat over the top guy and it’s followed by Oppenheimer shrugging it off.  I know that part of the trailer drew some criticism initially.,2023-07-26 02:54:37
I thought Damon was greet.  However Groves was a 250lbs 6”3’ man.  Damon was not that towering of a figure that Groves was.,2023-07-23 14:00:36
His scene when talking to Jason Clarke was great! Although it’s true other actors get more chance to shine than him.,2023-07-22 05:16:26
"I was nervous about his performance because it always feels like he's not playing the character hes playing himself. However, I think he did a fantastic job here.",2023-07-22 19:53:08
MAAAAAATTTT DAAAAAAAAMOOONN,2023-07-22 23:09:13
"Why wasn't he in uniform during the ""hearing""?",2023-07-25 13:31:06
From the trailer I thought he'd be the only character to take me out of the movie. I was wrong! He did a great job.,2023-07-26 03:29:03
"I kept thinking that while Matt Damon was in the US working on the Manhatton Project, Matt Damon was getting saved by Tom Hanks in France",2023-08-05 05:37:34
"I was going to say I think everybody in this thread of going ""oh shit I forgot about _____ preformence"" in this movie.",2023-07-23 02:36:49
"I agree. RDJ was fine for his part, but nothing special acting wise. His character was good for sure.",2023-07-21 04:14:31
 i thought the line about the this is most important thing that ever happened was overacted a bit. Still great sound bite though.,2023-07-23 16:31:09
He's often had roles where you know it's Matt Damon but he really transformed into General Groves. That was a joy to watch and he handled the suspense of getting grilled over the clearance perfectly,2023-07-26 16:09:03
"The part where Oppenheimer says he was intelligent because he went to MIT. [My reaction

Matt Damon as Jesse Plemons playing Leslie Groves,2023-08-11 03:36:04
He was easily the best supporting performance imo,2023-08-12 05:33:25
Brilliant ending,2023-07-22 07:10:11
"Whenever people say that the nuking of Japan was justified because it arguably saved more lives than it caused if an invasion would have happened otherwise, it always strikes me that they never consider how it increased the chance of all of humanity burning.",2023-07-22 09:40:31
"So simple, so effective. Also love the disjointed nature of some of the scenes. He showed Einstein the drawing of the fallout after that meeting even though it was presented way before it. It’s like a puzzle that all came together at the end.",2023-07-23 03:04:06
What did Oppie say to Einstein,2023-07-21 12:01:30
"I’ve read several comments about the ending lines and I don’t know how that wasn’t the conclusion everyone had already made by the end? I felt like I said the words right along with Oppenheimer. He opened Pandora’s box.

For me I thought the timing couldn’t be better with this last year and the fears of Russia using nukes",2023-08-01 04:06:02
Can somebody posts the dialogues or post a link please?,2023-07-23 17:15:40
Is chain reaction a metaphor for something?,2023-07-22 11:45:03
Yeah in the first act especially I couldn’t help thinking damn the pacing is just ripping along for a 3 hour story,2023-07-22 21:18:26
"So well said. That first hour or so felt like the most chaotic of Nolan’s career. So many cuts. So many 30-90 second scenes. No prolonged dialogues. It just kept moving. Flying, frankly.",2023-07-29 01:38:52
"I’m not joking when I say Jennifer Lame deserves an Oscar for cutting this movie. Just incredible, breathtaking editing work",2023-08-14 11:31:05
It really did *feel* like a tiny physical workout - nuking calories away?,2023-08-18 01:34:28
"That’s when I knew, she had my vote for the Oscar nomination. I mean everyone just acted their assess off.",2023-07-21 15:42:49
"Blunt carried her own weight in this movie. When she was frustrated about Oppenheimer's naivete, I felt that to my bone. Despite being an alcoholic, her nose was razor sharp on the bullshit.",2023-07-22 01:31:09
I think a lot can be said about women in movies. Oftentimes their influence is judged by how much they say. Blunt’s character is heartbreaking in what’s not said. She and Oppenheimer never have the big blowout fight where all is laid bare bc 1) it didn’t happen in real life and 2) it was a WILDLY different world at the time. But her presence is so strong in every scene she’s in.,2023-07-22 23:36:08
"I hope I didn’t imagine it but I thought I heard the sound of horse hooves in the moment between her maybe breaking down and then perking back up and standing her ground. If I didn’t imagine it, then it was a very cool sound choice and evoked that memory of when her and Oppenheimer first got together and the foundation of their partnership.",2023-07-23 01:04:39
Im a week late here. But there was a scene earlier in the movie where it shows the end of her interview and she drops her bag and a liquor container falls out. I thought that was going to circle back but nothing really came of it,2023-07-28 02:49:24
I wish Nolan hadn't punctuated that moment with a man verbally patting her on the back though. That was literally the first scene in the movie where she did anything worthwhile.,2023-07-21 08:38:42
"Blunt may have been the breakout for me. I knew she was good, but holy fuck she was amazing.",2023-07-23 08:32:50
"She is such a remarkable actress, she makes so many simple choices to add special polish to her performances.",2023-07-25 04:40:04
"I found both female characters in the film to be the worst parts, I don’t blame them though I blame Nolan. Had you cut them out of the film completely it would have made almost zero difference to the plot. The big thing is she didn’t shake the guys hand?",2023-07-22 13:35:34
That was a perfect fuck you moment. Rami Malek’s character coming in clutch at the senator’s hearing was fantastic.,2023-07-24 03:58:15
"that was one of the best moments, revealing just how different the antagonist is from the protagonist",2023-07-21 15:05:55
I knew they'd use Einstein for a big blow and not over use him,2023-07-23 04:41:49
"Probably takes over as my favorite of his films, although it will be one of my least rewatched because... yeesh.",2023-07-25 04:41:18
Einstein will return,2023-07-24 18:27:02
Nolan’s best*,2023-07-22 02:51:55
"Yes, it’s ambiguous",2023-07-21 03:06:24
"there are theories that she may have been murdered, possibly by intelligence, etc. The movie makes it ambiguous",2023-07-21 09:19:02
"To this day, there are still questions about her death. Drowning oneself in a bathtub is a very unique way to go, and because of her connections to Oppenheimer and the Communist Party, theories mention murder rather than suicide.",2023-07-21 13:27:27
"Yes, it was suspected she was murdered.",2023-07-21 02:58:12
Yeah it was implied along with unsigned suicide note.,2023-07-21 11:14:26
I think it was implied that the other army guy (not Matt Damon) had it done when he was investigating Oppenheimer.,2023-07-21 09:40:31
"I'd so say the drowning being murder, while suspected, could also be an allusion to how Oppy felt he was the one that killed her by leaving.",2023-07-22 18:43:51
"I thought this was to be oppenheimer believing he caused her death, and the hands were to represent his hands.",2023-07-21 23:53:22
"Every scene show how she killed hersf by drowning her head inside the bath tub

But i swear there’s 1 quick shot that show a hand with black gloves killing her",2023-07-22 12:09:04

"Don't put a space between the ! in the first spoiler tag and the first letter.

The flower bit was pretty funny.,2023-07-22 11:22:35
"I get that it's ambiguous historically, but there is some element of Oppenheimer's imagination mixing in with reality throughout the film. The hand killing her could be anyone, or no one, or hell even him somehow.",2023-07-25 04:36:55
"Have you seen JFK by Oliver Stone? I think it's pretty apparent watching Oppenheimer that Nolan is a big fan of that film because this borrows a lot from its editing, cinematography, and pacing style.",2023-07-23 17:14:18
I KNEW I WASN'T IMAGINING THE OTHER HAND,2023-07-23 08:44:31
It’s missing a sense of Stone completing making shit up,2023-07-23 23:40:06
"I took that shot to be Oppenheimer considering himself responsible, as though he had murdered her himself by leaving.",2023-07-25 06:14:17
"Yes, that’s Oppenheimer’s paranoia making him see things/imagine things because he done fuck up",2023-07-21 23:15:26
Nixon is such an underrated film,2023-07-23 02:33:43
"I took that shot to be Oppenheimer considering himself responsible, as though he had murdered her himself by leaving.",2023-07-25 06:16:25
"Maybe a little too deep, but I thought it was a metaphor. He was imagining his own hands drowning her because it was his own actions that put her there.",2023-07-28 08:06:30
"I took it as Emily Blunt’s character picturing herself murdering her, since we saw earlier that she pictures them having sex.",2023-07-27 07:05:49
"Ok, so I was actually kind of confused because after that, doesn't she show to testify? And I don't mean the obviously imaginary sex scene. I thought I had understood something wrong and she had merely *attempted* suicide.",2023-07-22 06:48:14
Yeah it certainly looked in one scene where a gloved hand was leaving the frame.,2023-07-22 09:57:11
Yes! Came here looking for this. I knew I saw a black glove for a second. Definitely implying that maybe she didn't kill herself.,2023-07-23 18:39:20
Nixon is one of my favorite films and yes this reminded me a lot of Nixion!,2023-07-24 01:26:09
Yeah I thought the same. Was ambiguous about her death.,2023-07-24 11:09:00
Glad I didn't imagine that.,2023-07-24 12:51:19
"Yes I saw that. Basically, we’ll never know if she was killed or not :(",2023-07-24 22:54:23
"Yeah the film is like a cross between JFK/Nixon and DeNiro's The Good Shepard, in a good way.",2023-07-24 23:13:36
spoiler tag didn't work,2023-07-29 22:22:26
"I just watched for the first time today, and definitely saw a hand behind her head holding it under water.",2023-11-19 05:10:14
I didn’t know half the cast was gonna be in it. I went to a private screening with only some friends Wednesday night and I swear every time someone showed up I’d just say “Oh Dane DeHaan’s in this? Oh Josh Peck’s in this? Oh Rodrick Heffley’s in this?”,2023-07-21 03:56:17
"""Drake, where's the Uranium?""",2023-07-25 23:22:31
"Above all, sharing the screen with Cillian at one of the most crucial moments of the film. Props to him, I thought he was going to be predominately featured in the background. 

Then again I feel like just about everyone got some scene to shine in, even if it was brief.",2023-07-22 06:20:04
Laughed in the theater. Was so random. Like an SNL skit,2023-07-21 05:28:48

It was staggering filmmaking,2023-07-21 03:36:29
I like how the cheers slowly become less distinguished and start to sound like the wails of the damned.,2023-07-21 09:02:14
"The part of that scene where you could hear absolutely every minor detail and sound *except* the clapping and cheering was so abstract and off-putting, never seen anything like it. 

Really helped sell the mind implosion Oppenheimer was experiencing at that moment. I've never seen disassociation done so well in a film before.",2023-07-23 15:15:12
The one dude emphatically clapping and smiling was insanely creepy.,2023-07-22 01:23:20
"I was thinking, it kinda seemed like the people in  the background, all blurred out, had horribly disfigured, distorted faces. Very subtle, but absolutely added to the horror of the scene.",2023-07-21 07:47:25
"My fav part. Nothing like seeing the horrors you’ve created like stepping into a charred husk of what was once s person. Shit broke my heart. It was staged like a small town Beatles concert. And just fuck man, that made me feel so gross.",2023-07-22 07:45:47
Absolute highlight of the movie for me.,2023-07-21 15:35:27
Bro the woman sitting next to me clapped in this bit.,2023-07-21 19:14:47
"And there’s a point, as he’s walking away, where you’re not sure if you’re hearing the cheers of Los Alamos or the screams of Hiroshima.  As much as I’ve maligned the sound mixing of Nolan films (ever watch Batman Begins on TV?), I was very impressed by that.",2023-07-23 04:13:55

"When the sound finally came back, I jumped so high in my seat lol",2023-07-21 19:43:02
That scene. Fucking that scene.,2023-07-22 05:06:30
The isolated sound of the woman screaming gave me chills.,2023-07-23 01:09:04
"That was the best scene in the movie and honestly if it had ended right there I would have been ok. Personally, I felt the last 30 minutes afterwards covered things that had way less stakes than that scene. He could lose his clearance or be dragged through the mud professionally, but his realization he created death is infinitely worse, that was his own reality nuke",2023-07-23 12:04:51

My favorite part of the movie,2023-07-22 04:03:18
Lynchian,2023-07-22 01:04:01
"Highly *highly* recommend watching the HBO miniseries *Chernobyl*- it deals with the same sort of ideas- personal responsibility for horrors, an uncaring system eating people up, and the almost biblical terror of nuclear power. But in my opinion, the way that they portray the effects of radiation on the people who work the disaster and such is so much more haunting and staying than what was portrayed here. 

The most chilling image, in my mind, is a scene where one of the scientists working at the plant is sent by his incompetent, uncaring supervisor to visually inspect the melted down core. Every man under his command knows that this is tantamount to a death sentence, but so is defying him. So he goes up to the roof of the command building, slowly approaches the edge, and looks down to the core. 

It's just this unholy mass of wires and twisted metal with a yellow-green glow and a fire that is unlike anything on this earth. It feels purely malevolent in the way that only uncontrollable natural phenomena do. 

And then it cuts back to the worker's face: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F1f92UKWAAAjUpr?format=jpg&name=large

The despair on his face, the unspoken symptoms of a lethal dose of radiation showing on his face...it says so much with such small and specific brush strokes, I just think it's a masterpiece.",2023-07-23 05:00:03
Why the fuck was there a basketball hoop on the fireplace? How the hell does that work???,2023-07-22 23:17:27
"It was amazing. I kinda wish it had a bit more ""trauma"" post bombing for him but that probably would have made it a 3.5hr movie.",2023-07-24 03:15:17
Aronofsky vibes.,2023-07-25 03:26:12
I was trying so hard not to cry during that scene preparing myself to see the aftermath of the bomb depicted by the film. It doesn’t show it but we get a few glimpses and I almost lost it.,2023-07-25 03:27:08
AGREE. Left a great impression on me.,2023-07-22 11:45:47
And then accidentally standing in the charred body of a victim of the bombings.,2023-07-24 10:14:09
Stepping in the ashen corpse was also haunting,2023-07-24 05:59:12
If you told me David Lynch was asked to direct that one scene I would’ve believed you without a doubt.,2023-07-26 02:36:00

Missed chance to show horrified and disfigured victims of the bombings wandering and screaming to juxtapose the American cheers.,2023-07-25 04:19:41
"They had one burnt corpse in that scene. Hell, in the whole movie. Such wasted potential. Nolan had the opportunity to be so creative here, but just alternated between white people crying and screaming.

One of many instances in this movie where Nolan could have done something truly bold and impactful, and went the easy, more palatable route.

Edited for typo, and to add that people seem to think that acknowledging the Japanese victims in any form means that there had to be gorey after-bomb imagery. 

But I agree that any creative subtleties like the shadow of a crying Japanese woman or a singed kimono would probably have been beyond Nolan.",2023-07-22 00:31:49
"It was well done, fits with the character of the man. 

But man, the concept that we should be more concerned about jingoism in today's America than the alternative (oikophobia) is just so, so off the mark.",2023-07-22 00:31:26

How he stepped in that burnt corpse… chills,2023-08-20 23:42:24
A beautifully haunting and somber scene. I got teary eyed after he took that “one step”. I can only imagine the horror of being in those cities after the detonation. This scene will stick with me for a while.,2023-09-29 04:23:14
I was surprised he still stuck up for oppie after getting his communist advances spurned earlier lol,2023-07-22 08:00:45

His scenes were really subtle but good I must say,2023-07-24 19:05:38
"This was me with virtually everyone besides the core cast, like every time someone new came on screen I was like, ""Hey that's Gary Oldman"" ""Hey that's Matthew Modine"" ""Hey that's Josh Peck"" ""Hey that's Tony Goldwyn"". Incredibly star studded.",2023-07-24 23:37:02

"I thought he wasn't gonna speak but I'm glad he got an important scene eventually. 

I was so surprised to see Rodrick Heffley. And I knew Dane DeHaan was gonna be in it but it took me a while to recognize him, dude disappeared into the role. As for Josh Peck I kept debating whether it was actually him or nah.",2023-08-09 11:31:39
"The music was my favorite part of the movie and everything else about the movie was so fucking perfect.

Amazing job from Ludwig",2023-07-21 22:13:49

"100% agreed - I made a note to myself to look out in the credits for who composed the score, and as soon as I spotted his name all I could think of was Redbone (with Childish Gambino) which he helped produce. Guy's got range and talent overflowing.",2023-07-22 15:53:10
"I agree. Eerie score. But I felt the score was overused at times when only dialogue or diegetic sound would have had a bigger impact on scenes. 
There were scenes without the score like in the interrogation room and felt that silence was needed more for emotional impact",2023-07-24 02:20:36
The score was fucking AWESOME! Really kept the film moving.,2023-07-22 07:13:02
"For me, those have been my two favorite composers since 2017ish. Ludwig is quickly reaching legend status among others such as Zimmer, John Williams, Howard Shore, and others",2023-07-22 22:58:30
It was an amazing score but lacked a definitive memorable theme or texture. I would have loved to hear Jonny Greenwoods take on this film,2023-07-23 01:40:06
"I liked the music, I just felt it was too loud. I couldn’t hear what many people were saying",2023-07-24 22:59:31
The strings in the score were phenomenal.,2023-07-22 10:19:55
"I would be curious to know how Goransson sees the music fitting into the film, because I don't think he's comparable to Zimmer in many ways. Like, walking out of a movie scored by Zimmer you have at least one, if not multiple tunes you could sing to yourself. I'm not a savant or anything, but for e.g. after Interstellar I was easily able to get to a piano and pluck out and harmonize the main theme. That's how deep it sunk in over the course of the movie. 

Not so with Tenet and Oppenhiemer. Some really cool sounds and vibes (the acid synth with the heavy LFO in this one was sick) and the obligatory 8 French horn ""brown note,"" but nothing to really bring home with you. Maybe that's ok! But in my mind, a noticeable choice.",2023-07-21 21:42:02

"I thought it WAS Zimmer at first until I looked him up. He did a great job, really interesting use of what sounded like accordion? which worked really well to creat a very dramatic somber tone",2023-07-23 07:32:54
wasn't there geiger clicking in the score? loved that,2023-07-29 22:20:37

"I kinda dig his work with Nolan more than I did Zimmer’s collabs. Don’t get me wrong, Hans’ body of work is pretty iconic, but it kinda turned into a generic wall of sound for me. Göransson uses such a diverse soundscape and I think it compliments Nolan’s style and subject matter more.",2023-07-25 00:23:23

unbelievable work. The score was overwhelming but not distracting or in the way. Absolutely perfect. I don’t even have the words to describe it. I was on an emotional knifes edge almost the entire movie. Worked so perfectly with Nolans visuals.,2023-08-13 05:23:37
Been rewatching Community and listening to Childish Gambino's early work lately and it's crazy to me where Ludwig is now. His score on this is probably the best one I've heard in years. And to think this is all because Zimmer is busy doing Dune. I hope Nolan and Goransson keep collaborating.,2023-12-04 01:58:35
That had to be the most scored film of all time and coincidentally one of the best scored films of all time?,2023-07-22 22:50:36
Absolutely. I sat there thinking the score made this movie an incredible experience.,2023-07-23 05:00:56
"I can’t believe I had to scroll down this far to see this. Without the score, it would play like a by the numbers BBC procedural with ADHD. With the score, it’s a fast paced and gripping thriller. ",2024-03-27 12:15:34
Has Nolan said why he didn't use Zimmer for the score? I was surprised,2023-07-23 22:37:00
Didn’t look it up prior but during the movie I assumed Hans Zimmer composed it,2023-07-25 07:14:53
Ahh I was wondering if it was him or Zimmer when watching. I think Zimmer still hits harder but this guy did a great job with Tenet as well.,2023-07-27 05:13:26

"[Here's some footage of the actual Trinity test.](https://youtu.be/wki4hg9Om-k)

The film depicted it quite accurately, and it was dark which really obscures its scale. Perhaps because I was watching in the cropped 70mm format (albeit from 3rd row), but I was also a bit underwhelmed. And while there were some visually stunning shots, most were extremely quick flashes. I don't think enough to warrant a full 70mm IMAX screening.",2023-07-21 23:54:56

"The scale totally threw me off too. But I was really also expecting something more to the explosion considering the abstract “slo-mo” depictions that played in the first few minutes of the movie, where you could FEEL the power of it.

I was honestly a little underwhelmed.",2023-07-21 18:20:58
"if you compare the first two links, one could say, man this just looks way way way bigger than in the movie... and then you see your last link, and it is basically exacly how it is shown in the movie...odd, since the last link looks like a simple gassstation explosion.... perhaps because the environment is so dry? the 2020 israel port explostion was more 'holy shit' that this...",2023-07-23 00:21:15

I think that was important because Jean Tatlock was Oppenheimer's most intimate connection to death and suffering and his own responsibility for inflicting pain on others. So its significant that he read that quote in a scene with her.,2023-07-21 03:30:16

Fr LMAOO,2023-07-22 03:37:37
Nolan heavily implied throughout the film that they would go to any lengths to keep the project going and the secret in tact. Matt Damon talking about Casey Affleck's character in detail hints at this as well. Also they show how Strauss and the FBI were definitely capable of monstrous things. Tossing in JFK at the end is great foreshadowing as well.,2023-07-22 03:39:40
"It's the two opposing characters and their views on where the nuclear program should go. Oppenheimer was content with continuing work on fission projects and didn't want to escalate to fusion weapons. Strauss was all about working on fusion. The whole point of the Kangaroo Court at the end was showing that Oppenheimer was ""sabotaging"" the fusion program because of possible communist sympathies. The numbering at the beginning was to set up this dynamic and indicate that these two men and their opposing views are what drive the tension at the end.",2023-07-22 02:50:38
"Fission is Oppenheimer’s story, by definition it’s when a neutron slams into a larger atom.  Which I took as being Oppenheimer getting involved with the military and the manhattan project.  

Fusion by definition is a reaction between two or more atomic nuclei.  I take that as Oppenheimer is “battling” or “reacting” to RDJ and co.

Honestly just my opinion though, I’d love to hear from Nolan why we labeled them like that!",2023-07-22 02:49:11
"The fission was the development of the A bomb, it was mostly in color. Fusion was post A bomb, Hydrogen bomb times.",2023-07-22 02:50:42

I absolutely agree. I thought the scene where they interrogated her might have stolen the movie for me. She had me on a rope. Florence Pugh I thought did fantastic as well.,2023-07-22 04:54:43
"I loved how he showed the bomb explosion in full silence. 

The movie is loud, very loud. Yet one of the biggest bombs man has ever created goes off. Pure silence.",2023-07-21 03:22:49

This scene was jawdroppingly beautiful.",2023-07-21 03:49:36
"*""We knew the world would not be the same...A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another.""*

"Same here, you could hear a pin drop. Might as well have been in the theater by myself",2023-07-21 02:43:15
This is why theaters need to stay around is experiences like this. You can't get shit like that at home.,2023-07-22 06:03:40
I keep seeing people talking about the silence. Are you referring to the crowd or the fact the movie itself was silent?,2023-07-21 03:52:10
Nah some dumb teenager had his ringer on I almost strapped his ass to the bomb when it dropped.,2023-07-21 04:43:37
"Jealous of you, in my screening people just started making jokes and talk in that fucking tense moment and it just threw me off so much. Ugh. Like haha did they forgot the sound???? lol or maybe it's a silent mode ahahaha. Fuck that. Really ruined that moment for me.",2023-07-21 08:19:08
It was dead quiet in my theater. It was just a fantastic movie throughout.,2023-07-22 06:13:50
Someone's phone went off during the silence 💀,2023-07-21 06:32:57
"I remember the music being more intense as it got nearer until the detonation, and I remember sweating my butt off.",2023-07-22 04:34:59
"I mentioned it in my review, but for all the quiet scenes I could hear the muffled sound of the shutter for the projector. Obviously not the same thing as a dead silent scene, but it was still dope",2023-07-21 03:14:55
"Just got back from a late showing and somehow someone in the theater fell asleep and was snoring. Boggled my mind. Gym scene, explosion scene nothing would wake him up.",2023-07-21 07:03:37
People behind me thought the silence was an invitation for a chitchat,2023-07-21 22:31:59
"I shit you not, someone in my theater had an alarm on their phone go off at the *exact second* this happened and they couldn’t find their phone to turn it off for a full minute. I’m still irate",2023-07-22 01:49:36
It makes sense scientifically right? Sound waves will take time to reach to the observers,2023-07-21 07:48:10
I knew Nolan was gonna try and jump scare all of us with the explosion sound.,2023-07-21 08:59:23
"Some idiot & his gf the row behind me laughed at this exact moment, like they thought it was a plot device & not how the sound would actually travel 🤦‍♂️",2023-07-21 23:06:13
This is a trick he's used before in Interstellar right? There's a scene in that with a massive explosion in space but we see it from afar so in a complete silent void.,2023-07-21 23:13:13
"Yup, seeing it in IMAX 70mm, packed crowd, yet I swear I could’ve heard a pin drop it was dead silent",2023-07-22 14:49:27
Unfortunately that moment for me will forever be haunted by the random ringtone of the dude in the cinema that ringed the exact second the silence happened,2023-07-25 21:25:39

Told Rian Johnson to hold his beer. “Holdo maneuver? Nah I got this”,2023-07-23 00:54:24
There was a child probably 6 or 7 a few rows in front of me talking though the scene. I was going to lose my shit.,2023-07-23 23:23:36
"Some jack wagon was either legit asleep, or making a loud snoring noise during this.  If it would have been near me, I would have done something about it.",2023-07-24 04:45:47
Pretty underwhelmed tbh,2023-07-24 22:13:27
"Funny you had that experience, in my theatre some guy was shouting ""boom"" at the screen.",2023-08-05 14:47:36
i will never forget the guy on my rigth munching on pop corn during the whole film... and heavily breathing the rare time he didn't.,2023-07-21 13:06:01
Same… you could hear a mouse fart.,2023-07-21 19:21:09
I was quite literally forced back into my seat when the sound of the explosion finally came in - almost like the shockwave radiating out from the blast and finally hitting you. Has to be one of the most impactful moments I've ever had in a cinema.,2023-07-22 21:17:48
"I, on the other hand, had someone behind me coughing up a lung and blowing his nose like a trumpet every time there was a quiet scene. Just like going to the symphony...",2023-07-24 01:03:21
It brought me back to some of the scenes during Interstellar. Just seeing people physically move to the edge of their seats. Only Nolan can do this. He creates such an experience. Pleasure to watch.,2023-07-24 10:27:30
"There were not one, but two babies making noise during that scene in my theater, definitely took me out of it. Never understood why people can't just get babysitters.",2023-07-24 22:42:25
"You're right. I didn't realize it at the time because I was so engrossed. But there was perfect silence. Not a cough, not a shuffle. Everyone was frozen. What an amazing experience.",2023-07-25 02:12:19
"There was a soyjack in my theater that went “aaaahhhhh” when the film went silent… like yeah, super funny, dude",2023-08-01 06:50:53
"The lady in front of me started sobbing and moaning, had everyone looking at her…",2023-07-21 09:19:36
As soon as the dead silence happened someone’s phone went off in my theatre and they didn’t turn it off until the explosion sound went off. So pissed,2023-07-23 04:42:12
"I'm so used with people clapping or laughing at great moments but the trinity test just had people so silent in the local theater I watched it was so bizzare

I guess it hits differently when it is everybody's reality now",2023-07-25 00:00:27
Someone brought a baby into my theatre and it kind of diminished the effect unfortunately 🥲,2023-07-25 00:25:35
"It would have been incredible.  Unfortunately, my Imax experience had a 10 year old talking to his dad during it",2023-07-31 00:18:48
I’ll never forget the one person clapping after the final credits and then reading the room and quickly stopping.,2023-08-04 05:03:17
"You're lucky! There was somebody a few seats down from me eating candy out of the world's loudest, crinkliest wrapper and another person up in front trying to add commentary to that scene. It was a reminder of why I've come to prefer just watching new movies at home since the pandemic.",2023-07-23 01:48:37
"My friend had the unfortunate timing of needing to sneeze right when all sound vanished

Still an incredibly jaw-dropping scene, but I had to try not to laugh with that moment",2023-07-21 04:40:14
*stunning and brave*,2023-07-21 13:38:07
Was your theater super loud before that?,2023-07-22 09:11:01
The awe and terror and anxiety I felt during this scene is going to stay with me for a long time. Actually teared up during it.,2023-07-22 11:10:40
"My theater was so damn quiet during that scene, I could hear my heart practically beating out of my chest. Then for the aftershock to roll through.

What a masterpiece",2023-07-22 21:05:59
Just watched the movie and had the same exact thought. Never heard a movie so silent,2023-07-25 03:42:16
"I hope you mean the explosion is something you won’t forget, and not that silence is so rare where you go to see films it’s unforgettable",2023-07-25 18:10:56
This is why I was so dead set on seeing it this week because I knew in my city I only had a few days to catch it on our only imax screen,2023-07-26 12:52:34
reminded me of the interstellar scene when cooper jumped into the blackhole,2023-07-27 03:35:52
"Very similar to when Matt Damon's character blows up part of the Endurance in Interstellar. Completely quiet explosion, was an amazing moment",2023-07-27 14:31:12
I watched in standard view sitting 4 rows away from the screen. It did not feel like 3 hours and was comfortable watching it. My question is about the explosion. We’re people truly that close to the test site in reality? Would it not have exposed them even though it was not a full blown explosion? Any thoughts?,2023-08-01 17:55:31
You go to the movies with a circus? I can’t remember a single time silent parts of movies wouldn’t have been silent as everyone’s just watching the film. But maybe that’s just Finland.,2023-08-02 00:05:04
Just like in interstellar,2023-08-07 05:32:31
"Some asshole in front of me was on his phone JUST DURING THAT SCENE! Like what the hell dude, this is like the whole reason I'm here",2023-09-05 21:24:10
"Man a very similar thing to happened to me when I first saw Interstellar. Except it happened right as they let Dr Mann out of the cryo-bed and just as we saw that it was Matt Damon the movie stopped. I had to wait a week to finish it, it was torture.",2023-07-21 13:37:37
That would actually be kinda nice. I had to take a strategic pee break.,2023-07-22 00:33:39

"In San antonio, Texas they canceled our showings. No free tickets. We planned a tripp there, got an airbnb and lost a day of work.

That shit costs hundreds of dollar, all to not watch the movie.",2023-07-31 00:19:40
Oh man. Our 70mm didn’t even start due to a brain wrap but was thinking how terrible if it got messed up in the middle of it!,2023-07-30 22:26:18
Those lightbulbs are no joke.,2023-07-25 04:51:11

It felt like he was in the background for a few minutes then suddenly was key to the whole exoneration.  It just felt weird",2023-07-23 18:49:42
"My buddy HATES horror flicks. He just sat and stared at his phone while the trailer was playing and afterwards goes ""damn, man, they shouldn't be allowed to do that"" lmao",2023-07-21 04:27:28
Dawg I don’t do scary movies and especially when they’re creepy children. The final few frames of that trailer are gonna be burned in my mind for awhile,2023-07-21 04:49:56
It’s hilarious that one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer had a trailer for that Paul Giamatti movie that’s gonna sell 3 tickets.,2023-07-21 05:52:48
I’m apparently in the minority here because I didn’t think it looked that good & a few people around me were whispering the same thing.,2023-07-21 22:35:41
every single person in my theater seemed to have the same “okay wait this actually looks good” reaction to that trailer lol,2023-07-21 03:07:21
"Do you know what trailer they played before my showing...

The DAMN MOVIE all of us were seeing in the theater! >:-/",2023-07-21 04:52:06
A lady in her mid 50s to the left of me burst out laughing when she released it was an Exorcist movie,2023-07-21 05:37:43
Trailer looked surprisingly good. Super creepy!,2023-07-21 02:40:48
"My theater didn’t play trailers :( 

It went straight from blank screen to Nicole Kidmans AMC bit to the movie.",2023-07-21 21:38:55

"Bro no hate!  It looked great!!

I hope it turns out to be a decent October horror flick!",2023-07-21 04:57:29
"I had to look down at my feet during that trailer I don’t have the stomach for that stuff.

Right as the trailer ended though, my theater was silent and one guy just let out a loud, “NOPE” which got a big laugh from everyone and cut the tension before the movie started.",2023-07-22 23:36:05
"Hey, better than the Oppenheimer trailer that played before fucking Oppenheimer in my theater lol",2023-07-22 00:25:45

Edit: I was kinda sad not to see Dune part 2's new trailer on the big screen, but also kind of glad it wasn't shown, cause it shows literally every major plot point in the remainder of the book.",2023-07-21 09:08:54
They played the trailer to new Poirot film in ours and it looked like an exorcist film.,2023-07-21 22:47:00

"I thought the trailer looked good, as did the group of people I was with. However I'm a bit hesitant because all the Exorcist movies outside of the original are not good IMO",2023-07-21 05:05:23
My entire theater laughed so hard at the end of that trailer,2023-07-24 02:44:12
"So, is it shitty? I am legitimately curious.",2023-07-21 02:40:15
"I knew what it was the moment it started because I had heard beforehand, but it was great hearing the theater realize what it was and the chatter after the title haha.",2023-07-24 01:45:33
"Oh wow, I didn't get that in my theater. That's a little disappointing- does it look good?!?",2023-07-21 05:36:41
The first 3 notes I knew what it was. It actually looks terrifying. It took me decades to get over the first one.,2023-07-24 06:56:16
They really chose the most off-putting young actresses in Hollywood to play those girls.,2023-07-24 11:12:26
Man I cringed when they played that. Like why?? No one wants to see some child turn into a deformed possessed baby in full imax with the sound blaring,2023-07-31 07:43:41
I didn't appreciate it!,2023-08-12 04:44:19
I was excited for the movie but the trailer looks dumb. 2 kids possessed is kinda lame.,2023-07-23 07:41:49
Same. Looked very hacky.,2023-07-23 11:41:15
Same here. Lol.,2023-07-21 23:26:40
I fucking hated that. lol,2023-07-23 09:40:29
Theatre I was at went crazy for that trailer. Big nope for me lol.,2023-07-24 04:04:49
"Looked fun, but a couple clips made me worry it's going to be generic as hell.",2023-07-25 04:41:51
Did not look great. Hopefully it was just a bad trailer,2023-07-29 15:20:50
"What’s the joke here? I thought it looked pretty scary, I so hate the demon faces. So guys next to me laughed about it, I guess they’re too cool to be scared.",2023-07-25 05:47:28
It was so fucking loud I had to plug in my ears. Almost the entire theater was turned off by it,2023-07-25 06:05:58
How does it look? Can’t see Ope for a while because all the good seats are booked for ages and it hasn’t leaked online yet.,2023-07-21 03:48:51
I feel like those loud screams and screeches during that Exorcist trailer were WAY louder than anything during the Oppenheimer movie. I literally had to cover my ears towards the end of the trailer.,2023-08-06 22:22:24
I saw Oppenheimer today and got The Exorcist Believer trailer as well.,2023-09-23 18:33:12
And deeply personal and isolating. He seemed so isolated for the most of the film.,2023-07-21 02:26:16
"I cannot explain how full of anxiety I was when I saw the countdown of the trinity test.

Even after I saw the movie, I can’t imagine how fucking unbelievable is. I mean I’m seeing a visual representation of an atomic bomb but man, in real life, is just unimaginable.",2023-07-21 02:54:57
"I never even thought about that until you mentioned. It does indeed feel like that. It's disorienting, like the brain can't properly process all the external stimuli cuz its already too busy.",2023-07-21 07:57:39
He even captured the feeling of knowing there’s sound all over you but it feels so .. silent and gone,2023-07-22 06:30:51
I literally had goosebumps and was partially covering my ears in anticipation of the aftershock boom from the testing. The lengthy silence from the bomb going off was deafening and I could feel the anxiety build up inside me lol,2023-07-22 04:43:21
A big telling on me moment was when everyone was slapping 5s and dancing around.  I’ve never felt more isolated with a character. That shit was perfect. I’m so excited to have seen a something I can consider perfect.,2023-07-22 07:49:54
"I wonder if he got any tips from Benny Safdie, who played Teller (Hydrogen Bomb guy) and also directed Uncut Gems (the most anxiety inducing film of all time)",2023-07-23 00:01:59
What an excellent description,2023-07-22 03:35:43
Yeah as someone with GAD that shit was accurate as hell. The scenes where he’s freaking out and hyperventilating during his speeches after the bombs are very similar,2023-07-25 20:34:25
"I’ve been searching for the perfect word to express this film. I kept coming back to “propulsive.” I was wrong, it’s there in your comment and it’s “unrelenting.”",2023-07-22 01:06:25
When the bomb exploded and eveyrthing is silent and then the sound hit them. Amazing.,2023-07-23 16:26:01

"> The gymnasium scene, after they learned of the Horishima bombing. This was Nolan directing a horror film.

Good analogy. It was a psychological horror scene, pretty trippy as well. 

[Cillian Murphy is also in another good example of what a Nolan horror would be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnNaXiL-q2E&t=21s).

Nolan could do a great psychological horror based on that messed up The Prestige ending.",2023-07-22 04:09:59

"> ""Can you hear the music, Robert?"" The scene where Oppenheimer is told to leave Cambridge and we seem him abroad, looking at art, thinking of the quantum world, all while the beautiful score is played. Such a beautiful montage. It happens early so it's somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes, but make no mistake I think it's one of the best in the film.

As a physicist I thought this part was kind of silly, but this sort of thing is pretty common in science related movies by now so I’m used to it. I was more confused that they never revisited it; other than the beginning they never really touch on anyone thinking about science or any thought process that leads to discoveries. The “science visualization” cgi sequences were done at the beginning and then never had a presence in any other part of the film.",2023-07-22 05:25:44

"There was a moment where he was speculating who could have led the trail of fire from Oppenheimer straight to his desk and in that very moment I thought, “fuck, he did it himself!”  When the twist was verified I felt a slight bit of disappointment and then thought get over it cocksucka you got one right for once. Enjoy it!

All hail Christopher Nolan and the IMAX format,2023-07-21 06:02:32
"I think Nolan has a bit of a bad rap for being a ""film bro"" director but I think he is genuinely one of the best of our time for exactly this. He makes dramatic films that also happen to be blockbusters. One of the few modern directors that can straddle that line. It's hard to think of another director outside of maybe Spielberg, possiby Tarantino, that would get blockbuster money and releases for even his more ""oscarbait"" fare. 

He's not a perfect director certainly, but I think it's become popular to shit on him in some circles for the wrong reasons. The fact he can drop a three hour biopic the same weekend as Barbie and have it still likely to make significant bank is a testament to his value in modern cinema.",2023-07-21 10:25:14
"Especially when his last film signaled the start of covid, this film shows the concept of “the movies” will never ever ever die",2023-07-21 14:31:27
This is happening because the movie was not sold as a 3 hour dialog heavy movie. It even caught  me by surprise. Lots of young fellas/teenagers confused in my screening.,2023-07-21 05:54:53
"Let’s remember that this is a movie directed by Christopher Nolan with a star studded cast. It was already very hyped since before it was even associated with Barbie. It’s not an indie flick. It was always going to be highly successful, especially since it’s of a more straightforward plot compared to previous endeavors of Nolan",2023-07-23 05:39:16
It’s like Nolan is just on such another level that he has to play on hard mode voluntarily but still flexes about it since it’s still too easy. “I bet I can make a 3 hour historical drama about one of the more sensitive subjects of American and world history that is rated R due to full frontal nudity with no CGI while going up against Barbie and Mission: Impossible after one week.”,2023-07-24 22:00:04

I see a lot of movies there, including a lot of the marvel movies. I’ve been to a 4:45 on opening night for some of them that aren’t that busy (the 7pm would be sold out though). For Oppenheimer, the whole weekend for every showing has been sold out (they announced 30/60 have been sold out). I went to a 4:45 on a Monday and completely sold out. It was really great to see.",2023-07-25 03:30:59

Alan Turing in Imitation game, Nicki Lauda having that crash in Rush, Oppenheimer having his life and reputation smeared due to imagined offences, etc. I really did not expect it to be this compelling for people with no context for what happened.

"Yeah they did a really good job of explaining the urgency and complexity of things without dwelling on it. All you really needed to know was they were making the bomb at Los Alamos and the bomb material was coming from other places.

The paper-and-pencil device was great actually, much better than the marble bowl IMO.

Biased as an Iowan, my only disappointment with that was there was no mention of Iowa State or the [Ames Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_process) which was developed there as part of the process. Many of the Manhattan Project sites are now US Department of Energy National Labs with Oak Ridge being ran by the nonprofit UT–Battelle but Iowa State became one of 4 Universities with such labs with the others being Princeton, Cal-Berkery, and Stanford. Iowa State however is the only one with their Lab on campus.",2023-07-23 17:31:54

JFK actually tried to amend the wrong doings that happened to Oppenheimer when he took office. Inviting him to the White House to apologize and awarding him the Enrico Fermi Award which they show in the movie. JFK wasn’t actually able to give the award to Oppenheimer though because he was assassinated prior to it. Lyndon B. Johnson was the one who actually gave the award following JFK’s nomination for Oppenheimer.,2023-07-23 08:43:43

I don't know what other people's theaters were like but the audience stomping and clapping was the loudest part of the movie for me. Louder than every explosion lol,2023-07-21 02:13:23

That was incredible. The use of sound was excellent.,2023-07-21 03:33:29
That was my favorite scene of the movie. Just came back from viewing and oh wow what a scene. I LOVED the artistic direction of making the actual bomb explosion relatively quiet to the rest of the film and yet the sounds of cheers ended up being the loudest and most dissociative thing in the whole film. They cheers ended up sounding like screams,2023-07-21 06:30:40

"That was one of the most interesting parts for me.  I don’t know what I expected when the explosion happened, but it wasn’t dead silence.  In retrospect it makes perfect sense, but in the moment I was left shocked.",2023-07-21 02:47:32
It was not at all what I expected but it was brilliant,2023-07-21 03:34:38
"Nolan has created a masterpiece, yes the first ten minutes are odd, and the first introduction of “I am become death the destroyer of worlds” was certainly unexpected. But, the visual and auditory depiction of anxiety and the feeling of being overwhelmed was masterful. Sure maybe it’s not the best ever, but of the movies I’ve seen in a cinema this is the best. 

Also yes the whole theater suspense and bewilderment was truly once in a lifetime.",2023-07-21 06:20:11

"I know the sound of the crowd stomping was used a lot but it reminded me of a train chugga chugging. Had that similar feel of an oncoming train. Pretty sure that was intentional, the use of trains also very prominent.

Someone's damn phone went off I wanted to throw hands,2023-07-21 23:37:27
"He didn't 'play' with anything, just used real life physics. It felt really good because throughout the movie you can see their text explosions *also* have a delay between the flame and the sound, which I found quite refreshing. And since they got farther and farther from the explosives the sound became more and more delayed.",2023-07-21 08:22:01
"The many uses of delayed sound (explosions and crowd noise) also reflect the theme of the movie, that your actions have consequences that may not be immediately apparent, but that cannot be undone. His affair, the bomb, his communist affiliations... Each a decision that ignited something, and only later does the blast arrive. 

As I write this, I realize that the poison apple at the beginning is an interesting counterpoint, where he does have a chance to reverse his action before the consequences.",2023-07-24 14:06:52

"I thought it was done really well, but I personally felt like scale was missing. I know he did it practically, but I sort of wish there had been a wider shot or an after shot in the daylight to show just how far the blast affected and things of that nature. I appreciate that they didn’t show the footage from Japan though, we all have imaginations that do the work for us after Nolan has set the hints in of melting flesh and charred corpses.",2023-07-24 18:51:17

"This moment was the moment that gave me the most goosebumps. This movie was pointing towards that ending and the way it was shot was beautiful.

Coming off the heels of RDJs final scene, who gave a fucking brilliant performance throughout, that scene has RDJ slowly inching towards Oppenheimer and Einstein in the background and ends where their conversation began earlier in the movie signifying that yes, we might still end up killing ourselves. ""Prometheus"" coming to the full realization of his contribution to what may come.


Yeah, that scene was okay. Lol",2023-07-21 08:27:06
"I think this was truly my favorite part.

For a “visual” film experience, it is surprisingly much more tame than I was expecting for a Nolan film…

But the images that were used will stick with me, ESPECIALLY the last one. That final image is what Nolan seems to be trying to encompass with this film. Having a discussion over the “genie” that’s been unleashed, and finding proper people to monitor it.",2023-07-21 07:24:47

"Lots of people here are talking about the main topic of conversation Einstein and Oppenheimer had had the end, but I think what did it for me was Oppy’s comment at the very end and the visuals of the ICBMs launching and destroying the world.

"We do, its just that most people don't care.  If you look at the work being done today on quantum technologies (quantum computing) and biology its nothing short of incredible.  Its also that we really haven't discovered any new major theories, most of our scientific progress lately has been aplication.",2023-07-21 06:32:52
The way I see it is the more stuff we discover the harder it gets to discover more stuff and the more people are necessary to make those breakthroughs happen. One dude just figuring stuff out isn't a thing that can happen anymore.,2023-07-21 11:38:08
"I think a lot of it is that what scientists are doing today is so far beyond what most people will learn about in school. People learn about the Bohr model of the atom in 7th grade. The Nobel Prize for physics in 2016 was given ""for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter"". Does anyone without a phd even know what that means?",2023-07-22 00:22:32

"> There were a lot of generationally smart people on earth at the same time. Several names I recognized from textbooks that I didn’t realize knew each other and worked together. It could be because I’m not actively studying scientific journals, but it seems like we don’t have as many Einsteins, Bohrs, and Oppenheimers these days.

In one moment I thought “This like the Avengers for nerds”.",2023-07-21 17:12:08
"You’ve probably seen it because it gets posted to Reddit every now and then but look up the solvay conference of 1927. Look at the group photo, you’ll be surprised how many names you recognize from textbooks",2023-07-21 15:37:57
I think the other reason why we don't see the same level of genius these days is because of several other things 1) revolutionary discoveries are now few and far between because the big big ones already happened 2) we communicate differently with the internet and social media so it's easier to get drowned out or diluted. Back then articles were written about you and everyone read it. Now an article can be written and it might be one of ten others that are all over the internet.,2023-07-21 06:40:43
They also didn't have Twitter. Who knows how many current geniuses are befallen to modern technology. Some of those names might not have been as legendary and mysterious with all this immediate access to each other. People used to think Musk was a genius too. History might change that as well.,2023-07-21 14:41:41
I think a modern day example of smart people and science at work was the speedy development of the Covid vaccine. That will probably be a really cool movie in about 50 years.,2023-07-22 23:09:22
History-making scientists often don’t get the publicity until after the events have entered history. We’re too close to things to see how revolutionary the race to get a Covid vaccine was.,2023-07-22 23:30:54

"There are many scientists at that level, but ultimately the problems we're dealing with now are too complicated and too difficult for a single savant to tackle the way the Bohrs and Heisenbergs could. Laboratories like CERN, where the really exciting stuff is happening, are at scales larger than Los Alamos and foundational papers have author lists large enough to staff entire universities.",2023-07-24 02:45:07
"I think scientists today are every bit as smart as those guys were then. But those scientists had just landed on the shores of whole new unexplored continents of knowledge. Everywhere they looked, they discovered something mankind had never encountered before, and became legends. 

Today, since all the easier discoveries have been made, it’s harder and harder to have world-changing breakthroughs that seemingly happened like every six months from around 1890-1950. Science no longer looks like a 1-2 scientists sitting in a room with a chalkboard and basic instruments. Today it requires hundreds, sometimes thousands of geniuses using multi-billion dollar equipment and enormous stores of collective knowledge and training just to barely move the ball down the field in extremely niche arenas. More often than not they’re just confirming or refining the groundbreaking theories Eisenhower, Heisenberg, Bohr, and Oppenheimer made back then.",2023-07-30 04:34:55

"Mostly because the amazing discoveries in physics are incredibly convoluted and into the weeds of quantum mechanics or the standard model or very specifics of relativity that just isn’t viable for grade school textbooks. Roger Penrose (black holes and it’s relation to relativity), Hawking was recent enough so I’ll count him (Hawking radiation), Steven Weinberg (standard model), Kip Thorne (Relativity/Ligo). Those are the more “famous” names. There are many more. There are fewer elementary discoveries as the technology Revolution kind of addressed most of those through the 1900s. Nowadays several years and hundreds of millions have to go into research and the discoveries aren’t as elementary and thus not nearly as easy to understand.",2023-07-23 06:07:30

"That was a particular period in time when human knowledge had come to an inflection point, in particular there was a huge theoretical inconsistency between electromagnetism and general relativity despite both theories seeming to be emprically correct, that's where quantum physics came from. Throw in the end of European colonial domination and the rise of Communism there was also a lot changing politically as well.",2023-07-27 05:09:21
"I think one of the reasons, definitely not the only one, but one of them is that those generational geniuses went to different fields today, like computer science for example.",2023-07-27 14:27:36
"There are plenty of geniuses around, just like the ones you mentioned. The problem is that there are less and less scientists that are also great science “salesmen”. 

Especially in today's hyper competitive world, with every piece of media vying for your attention. How in the hell are we gonna find someone that’s a genius at scientific research but also knows how to deliver the message to the Everyman. 

The last one we had that had this level of stardom was Stephen Hawking. Now we’re stuck with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Then there’s scientists that are practical in their approach like Bill Nye who “recently” made a comeback. Mythbusters also ended which was huge for bringing science to the masses but Adam Savage still brings a lot to the table on his YouTube channel Tested. 

But a super genius that’s also a great salesmen is not easy to find and we may never get another one. Especially if advertising companies keep pushing media companies to spit out more and more content.",2023-08-02 02:35:24

Destruction porn wouldn't have fit thematically. Besides this is a biopic and we're essentially seeing Oppenheimer's perspective. Part of that comes with the loss of control of his creation. He didn't get to see Hiroshima and neither do we. But what we got was infinitely more haunting in the speech after the news broke when we hear screams spliced in the cheers. The anxiety is dialed up to 10 in that scene.,2023-07-22 07:56:10
"I agree about recreating dropping the bomb, but I wholeheartedly think showing the slides the scientists were viewing of the aftermath would have been way more impactful. The movie hammers home how destructive the bomb was, but how people thought it was necessary (whether it was or not is not for me to decide). We absolutely should have seen the aftermath and the consequences of their actions",2023-07-23 21:09:16
I feel you!! I liked that Nolan focused more on Oppenheimer's reaction as well,2023-07-21 11:27:33
It really portrayed how Oppenheimer felt so isolated after creating the bombs and shipping them off. Groves' final comments at Los Alamos didn't really instill confidence that Oppenheimer would remain looped in on information.,2023-07-21 13:54:15
"This is the one point I completely disagree. The Atomic Bomb is the Focal Event of this entire film, The deadliest weapon of mass destruction in human history as well as The Defining Moment of the life of Oppenheimer. I didn't exactly need to see the horrors it unleashed on humanity. But I wanted to actually see the bomb explode, A good mushroom cloud that's so massive in scale it blows my mind away. I felt that the Trinity Sequence was good for what it's supposed to be but I really expected a bigger and better explosion in the final act to hammer in the dread of what Oppenheimer had just created.

"This comment reminds me of something this movie didn’t touch on, but someone was assigned to the job of going out by himself to the bomb to figure out what was wrong in the event that it didn’t explode. I assume it was a “not it” scenario to how he got that job, but that would be absolutely terrifying if it didn’t go off and he now had to drive out to the site completely alone and poke and prod it to figure out why it didn’t go boom.",2023-07-30 07:41:04

"The mild surrealism of his anxiety about the victims was so good. Everyone is celebrating and you can't tell what's screaming and what is laughter. There are true surreal images (face melting), but then there's the guy outside throwing up from drinking too much but in that moment representing radiation poisoning. That sequence is stellar.",2023-07-21 02:32:17
"This is Nolan showing that he’s capable beyond his own typical crutches, while also simultaneously using a lot of those same crutches in restrained ways to craft the story in a similarly compelling way as all of his films. I can’t definitively state how I feel about the film, having only literally just seen it, but I do know that it feels like an incredibly significant film in his filmography. I love all of his movies but I can’t help but laugh at a lot of the Nolanisms, but not here. The Prestige is right there and very similar though. Still maybe his best of his previously released.",2023-07-21 06:56:42

The actors I recognized from TV shows were such a delight. I'm happy I didn't know who the rest of the cast was. It was such a nice surprise. Even Rami Malek's short screen time is a scene stealer.,2023-07-21 11:46:56
Thank god he fixed the dialogue in this movie from Tenet. I don’t think I would’ve been able to make it through if he kept his “experimental” dialogue for this movie.,2023-07-22 04:02:38
"I think it's up there for me with The Prestige and Memento as his best. This movie is near flawless in its execution. You can nitpick a little bit on the approach ""it should be more science-y"" or ""it should've shown more of the bombing"" but it had a clear vision and it executed it perfectly. Nolan should be a serious contender for Best Director for this one",2023-07-22 04:55:36
"Easily his best since Interstellar. Tenet was a mess even if it was very entertaining, and Dunkirk I just couldn't get into.",2023-07-23 11:49:35
"I feel he was able to pull out all the stops film making wise because he didn’t have to worry about creating some overarching meaning (ala Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, etc.); it was a biopic after all. He fully got to worry about and tell the stories between characters, and figure out a way to convey emotions and feelings (ie the background shaking behind him when giving the speech at Los Alamos)",2023-07-25 03:38:27
"I really enjoy how he plays with sound in here and Dunkirk, there's this abundance of sound and noise and there's this complete absence of it and the sheer contrast can create tension or drive the narrative. I feel no one else makes movies so sound-centric",2023-07-21 08:36:54

"She also asks him to *read it* after he gives a summary of it, implying she wanted to hear it in Sanskrit but he just says the English translation anyway.

"When it happened, I rolled my eyes.  After finding out the thematic tie-ins with feelings guilt and responsibilty I think it made alot more sense to have the line be said with that particular character.  Still a bit clumsy but I'm gonna give it a pass.  I mean the line had to be in there somewhere, it's the ""whatchoo talkin' about willis"" of Oppenheimer.",2023-07-21 06:17:41
"Yeah that was really my only criticism. The second time they used the line it felt right, but it was already spent in that first scene. 

It’s weird to waste such an iconic quote to a flirting bit. Maybe I’m dumb and don’t get it.

"I think that tracks with what actually happened

> At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated ""brighter than daytime"" for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as ""being as hot as an oven"" at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over 100 miles (160 km) away, and the mushroom cloud reached 7.5 miles (12.1 km) in height.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)",2023-07-21 13:43:07
"The explosion itself is only one part of it. 

The entire 10 (maybe more?) minute sequence preceding it, slowly building up the tension, is one of the most amazing things I’ve felt. The level of tension achieved, the explosion itself happening and then the tension shooting right back up there when you realise that any second the sound is going to get LOUD. 

Nolan always hits for me but whereas I’ve loved his other movies for the way he takes a scientific concept and fucks with it, this one I think comes out on top for the way he crafts tension and uneasiness.

EDIT: Jfc I sure love the word “tension” tonight. Saw it 30 minutes ago, the feeling is very fresh on my mind.",2023-07-21 23:09:17
"It should have been fairly obvious there would be silence, since all explosions in the movie are sound delayed like in real life.

There will likely be analyses of each scene for how far away the explosion is from the viewer.",2023-07-21 14:29:48

"During the countdown, myself and everyone in the theater (imax) sat up and braced for a boom, but it didn’t come, not in the way we expected.

"Was also set up perfectly by a scene or two before it when they show some tests and the sound delays too. Great decision considering people may think the sound cut out on accident and take them out of the scene if it hadn’t been done.

"Im a manager at a theatre and I was taking bets on what would happen during the explosion. A lot of people said huge sound, others figured there'd be a harsh ear ringing, but I'm proud to say i figured it'd be silent. I likened it to the hyper speed ship scene in the new star wars. The silence is chilling.",2023-07-22 04:15:29

To my recollection they showed a trailer for Tokyo Story (the BFI were doing screenings of it), The First Slam Dunk, Gran Turismo, Napoleon, A Haunting In Venice, Blue Beetle, and Killers of the Flower Moon. After the trailers someone who worked there gave a quick spiel about turning your phones off and asked us all to give a quick round of applause to the projectionist (shout out to Alex, it looked great), which was nice.",2023-07-26 16:19:45

"I was in an imax 70mm and there were no previews, but the movie still started 20 minutes after ticket time as if there were",2023-07-25 00:13:32
Our 70 mm IMAX started 30 minutes later than the start time and had no previews. Wish they would have said it would start late so I wasn’t stressing in the popcorn line. It was definitely for the stragglers because so many people were still coming in that late.,2023-07-26 02:28:27

"I don't get not liking the last 1/3rd. It was everything. The anxiety, the claustrophobia... The bomb looked cool. But the chain of events that followed is what mattered and it's perfectly capped by the end conversation with Einstein. And the culmination of RDJ being so consumed by his own ego and greed that he couldn't imagine fucking Oppenheimer and Einstein might be talking about something more important than him, and how it resulted a 40 year cold war and arms race that triggered how many global conflicts? 

It's presented as Oppenheimer's tarnished reputation and fight to maintain his integrity, but it's also so much bigger than that.

How quickly this (many) scientific achievement(s) is(are) hijacked by politicians and power hungry egos that don't look at a broader picture or the longer timeline. Once the knowledge is loose, the people that understand it most are sidelined for people who can take advantage of it.",2023-07-21 07:08:00

"Einstein was like that in real life. I recommend the book Quantum by Marjit Kumar. Though his greatest achievements were behind him, throughout his career all the greatest scientists in physics still sought Einstein to bounce their ideas off of him and see how he felt. Notice I said how he felt, not what he thought. He was respected for his intuition. He guided other great geniuses, some better mathematicians or simply more intellectually capable than himself, with his intuition. He would say things like ´there is something there´ and that was all they needed. Im talking people like Wolfgang Pauli, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi. Gods of physics. They all wrote him with their latest work, to ask what he thought of the direction they planned to take it.",2023-07-21 12:33:59

"You are right. Also Lord Krishna doesn't really want to wage war in the first place. He tries to act as a peace negotiator between Pandavas and Kauravas(the two families who are on war with one another) but after the prince refuses peace terms with Pandavas he is forced. The correlation can be also found with Soviet Union and USA during the cold war. Oppenheimer wants peace terms between the two nation and tries to act as a peace negotiator but is put on the sideline by doing nothing. Dharma also translates to people born as a Kshetria(the class of Arjuna) to do their prime duty which is fight taking a side of justice against injustice and prejudice no matter who it is up against. 

I believe there is also a Jewish tradition on warfare somewhat similar to this. As Oppenheimer is himself a Jew says something like Jews should avoid war at all costs but it is understood that sometimes war may be the only way to resolve problems and bring peace, when all other attempts have failed. It may be that a strike is necessary to prevent the enemy from striking first. This is known as a pre-emptive war",2023-08-01 05:34:55

The world would never be the same again after that test and the subsequent bombing, and it was just horrifying. These days there are often threats of nuclear war and this and that, but I imagined my grandparents who would’ve been 20 something when the bombings happened and how absolutely terrifying that must’ve been.",2023-07-23 23:53:27

"As a history guy... I noticed a lot of references to communism, fascism, the labor movement, and the Red Scare that I wouldn't have comprehended so well as a younger person. Most of what I know about those things I've read after graduating college.

"I read the book before watching the movie and it made me realize the film has two major flaws.

First, Nolan never tells us *why* Oppy losing his security clearance is a big deal. Literally all was needed was his wife or another scientist saying “if you lose your clearance, you’ll be cut off from the rest of the work - you won’t be able to contribute at all.” But alas, as much talking as there was, we didn’t get this line or anything like it. So what was at stake, unless you’d read the book or knew the history already - general audiences wouldn’t know.

Second, Nolan deafens us with music and sound effects so we can’t hear the dialogue. I think I missed maybe 20-25% of what was said. It seemed when there were moments that were more critical, he backed down on the music/sound and let the dialogue come through. But many many times I was longing for subtitles.",2023-07-21 15:23:02

"Its not just a movie line.  Its factual.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_L._Stimson

>As Secretary of War, Stimson took direct and personal control of the entire atomic bomb project, with immediate supervision over General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. Both Roosevelt and Truman followed Stimson's advice on every aspect of the bomb, and Stimson overruled military officers when they opposed his views. 
 That is best seen after military planners had selected Kyoto as the most promising target in southern Japan for nuclear attack. Stimson, remembering his honeymoon in that city, once again overruled his generals:

>*Kyoto had been favored for the very first attack but the committee opted to blitz Hiroshima, which was an important army depot and embarkation port within an urban environment. Targets in the south were given priority to boost possible invasion plans but the ancient city of Kyoto was withdrawn because the U.S. Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, who had honeymooned there, said it was an important cultural center and ""must not be bombed.""*",2023-07-21 21:15:25
">""We're taking Kyoto off the list because I vacationed there once with my wife.""

That wasn't the quote or the reason?

""12 cities...well, 11 cities. I've taken Kyoto off the list due to its cultural significance""

Is the first part of the quote. Are you upset at the fact that Kyoto is the most culturally significant city in Japan? It was absolutely the correct moral decision to take Kyoto off the list. 

It was noble for the US to even consider preserving the historical wonder of Kyoto. You're viewing it through the wrong lense.",2023-07-24 12:32:53

"They didn’t explain it well but they had beef for a few main reasons. 
1. Strauss wanted to develop the H-bomb and nuclear power but oppenheimer refused to support the production of the H-bomb. 
2. Strauss is Jewish and feels like oppenheimer is reducing his Jewish heritage by being an adulterer and not following his religion enough. 
3. Strauss was a notoriously hard-headed guy and unforgiving and oppenheimer making him look stupid in front of the committee hearing pissed him off and he never got over it.",2023-07-21 02:46:18
"I think the scene with Truman really captured it. Truman dismissed Oppenheimer's guilt as if it was egotistical to assume that he was to blame for the bomb, instead insisting that it was in fact himself that was to blame, but almost in a proud way of it. 

Einstein's comment to Oppenheimer tells him that being considered the pinnacle of a field invites the haters, really. 

Strauss was just a hater. Hell-bent on proving that perhaps Oppenheimer wasn't a paragon. At the end of the day, humans are egotistical and that is just as much a fact of nature as nuclear physics.",2023-07-21 03:06:39
Oppenheimer publicly humiliated Strauss and questioned his authority; in the movie Strauss uses his as justification to destroy Oppenheimer's reputation in the eyes of the American people.,2023-07-21 02:43:45
"Strauss, at least as interpreted by this film, had an inferiority complex and was embarrassed by Oppenheimer publicly. Then when Oppenheimer started taking the opposite political stance on development of the H bomb, this resentment curdled into convincing himself Oppenheimer is a security threat. 

Having read the book this is all based on fact but certainly played up. I don’t think we know for a fact what Alden Ehrenreich worked out at the end. 

Strauss not getting his appointment was certainly attributed to what happened with Oppenheimer, but I must imagine they make that a lot clearer in the film than actual depositions would indicate.",2023-07-21 03:15:00
Yeah there were so many cool things I loved about the movie and I'm a total Nolan stan (enjoyed Tenet even) but I think I was too dumb to understand what was going on in the last act lmao,2023-07-21 03:12:10
"There’s a new documentary on Peacock called To End All War that gives good background on Oppenheimer and the people around him, I saw it before the movie. Nolan was interviewed in the doc as well.",2023-07-21 03:13:47
"Same, but I would note this is a strength of Nolan as a writer. He treats his audience’s intelligence with respect, and even if I’m not understanding what’s happening, the emotions are always there for me to experience directly anyways (like watching great Shakespeare). And then, on rewatches, I’m rewarded with piecing things together. In fact, his movies demand rewatches, and not just for a flat feeling of familiarity or entertainment, but a challenging, stimulating task of further engagement, and always getting something new from the movie.

I’ve seen The Dark Knight and Inception over a dozen times and am always picking up new things — I love it so, so much. Itching for my Oppenheimer rewatch already.!",2023-07-22 03:59:28

"Strauss wanted to be the father of the H Bomb, and he believed Oppenheimer’s opposition to the H Bomb was due to ego and not ethical qualms. Strauss systematically destroyed Oppenheimer so he could gain the power he believed he deserved.",2023-07-22 23:33:37
The conflict between Strauss and Oppenheimer in the final act was supposed to be a metaphor for mutually assured destruction. The little slights that kept building starting with Einstein not acknowledging Strauss were supposed to be like the escalation to nuclear war.,2023-07-31 08:10:01
A dude behind me was talking about how the Social Network is his favourite movie before the movie started LOL,2023-07-21 05:32:05

Social network is exponentially better,2023-07-22 04:53:33

"It’s funny you should say that. I came into the theater thinking that this was a Fincher film. It felt like a Fincher film at first. But then the scenes felt disjointed. And not in a way that flowed, but in a “trying too hard” way. And I was super confused.

Then there were really dramatic creative choices, like the scene in the hearing where Oppenheimer and his communist girlfriend appear nude, and I thought, “holy crap this is awesome! What a bold way to show that this is at the forefront of his mind during the hearing!!!”….and then that stylistic element is never used again. Like, when he breaks down and admits that he had moral quandaries, that would have been a prime opportunity to show the burnt bodies of the bomb victims behind him. But no, instead we get shaky cam.

If this movie proves anything about Nolan and his film-making, it’s that he desperately wants to be David Fincher, but completely lacks both the intelligence and creativity to pull it off. 

It’s too bad. An “Oppenheimer” movie by David Fincher would absolutely have been the masterpiece everyone here seems to have deluded themselves into thinking Nolan’s is.",2023-07-22 00:42:58

"I know what you mean, but I actually think some of these comments are justified. The first time I watched the film, it did feel lengthy but ultimately, I enjoyed watching it. 

I just watched it a second time last night(still hadn't come to reddit) and two thoughts were on my mind after the movie. The first being the moment they let off the nuke, the blast was almost laughable, it looked nothing like we are led to believe a nuke blast looks like, seemed more like someone blew up some gas barrels(no mushroom cloud, nor powerful Shockwave)... very underwhelming.

The second was how 'Nolan-y' the movie was, it seems the last few movies I've watched from him have all the same structure. I'm not a good movie critic so I'm not sure how to label it, but it's like he builds you up with all this info and then big twist and/or reveal and because his other couple movies were structured the same way, you could see the twist coming a mile away. I'm mainly referring to Strauss being overconfident he's going to win then getting shut down by Hill(Rami's character). Maybe it's not fair to say that since this was my second watch but maybe it is because my first time I was trying hard just to follow the characters/story so much that I couldn't actually judge the movie correctly. 

I still bought the movie, it is good enough for multiple play throughs and I love Nolan films but I would like him to go a different route as far as how he sets up his twists if he continues making films. I don't want to be able to guess it because I've watched other films he's made, that's really the only thing I would want him to work on as a filmmaker.",2024-01-13 16:02:45
"This is why when I see a trailer for a movie and go ""I'm going to watch that"" then when I watch it a year+ later I'm still blind on what people think of it (I prefer to watch movies at home). I don't go reading up on a movie until after I've seen it to not put any preconceived notions in my head as I watch it.

I personally enjoyed the ride Oppenheimer offered overall. One feeling I had though is I wish they would have gone deeper into the creation of the atomic bomb more on a technical level (seeing as the movie is 3 hours long thought there would be time for it lol). Understandably to make it work for modern audiences guess it could be too dry for such details though lol",2024-01-10 06:34:32

Strauss is constantly pulling the strings, masterminding everything to get back at Oppenheimer. But when Strauss goes down we don’t even see Oppenheimer at all. There’s not even any reaction from Oppie or indication he had anything to do with it at all. Kind of plays into the whole thing about Strauss being insecure and thinking everything is about him.",2023-08-06 01:00:31

"The last hour after the speech in the gym is the most important part of the film I feel.

Strauss and the government dragging Oppenheimer through the mud just showed how
Little the government cared about the well being of their top scientists. Using them and throwing them away when not needed.

The last hour made the movie for me",2023-08-30 20:46:41

That was the first thing we all said walking out of the theater. Just an incredible score from start to finish.

> Speaking of that scene, I know this isn't going to be an unpopular take, but RDJ was unreal in this movie. 

Also a point that stuck with me. The entire movie he's playing the stoic voice of reason, kind of the guiding hand for Oppenheimer.

I truly believe Nolan knows his mixes get lost at times and favors the feeling you get when music swells and emotion takes over. I think he picks and chooses what you don’t necessarily need to hear perfectly. There’s no way he misses that. IMO,2023-07-21 02:26:24

"We were talking about how it was difficult to understand what people were saying at certain points while walking out of the movie. My interpretation was that it could have been an intentional choice to make the viewer focus on the message of the scene, not necessarily snappy dialog. 

I feel like if you've seen the movie you get what I mean.

Many scenes seem to add to Oppe's character by making the audience feel a certain way about what they just watched. That feeling might be confusion, anxiety, humor, etc. and those feelings come about whether you understand the dialog fully or not.

Idk, just a take.",2023-07-21 02:57:46

We were saying the same thing too on the way home from the movie. How we wish there’d been captions bc so much gets missed between the accents and passionate speeches and musical score.

To be honest, I don't think most of the names mattered outside of a few like Chevalier, Teller, Strauss, Tatlock, and Grove (obviously everyone knows Oppy).

Like, with Oppenheimer's brother, you don't need to know his name, you see the character and remember it's his brother. Same for most of the scientist. You just know they are part of the team, with different roles, but their name aren't important (in history they are, but not necessarily in the film plot).

But that last 30 minutes or so, knowing names and hearing them said is important. It was definitely hard to keep track of names and then hear them said with the music and soft speaking.",2023-07-26 04:29:46

There were some very simple practical things they could have explained that informed the trajectory of the project. That they were working on two bombs at once. That the implosion of plutonium has to be so immediate and precise that most of the work was making explosives whose waves would lens through themselves.

I suppose if they had been forced to tell Chernobyl in a breakneck 3 hours, a lot more would have been glossed over. But it was really important with that show that the audience came away knowing what happened at Chernobyl and why, from a scientific and political angle. 

It is very clear that Nolan is far more interested in the psychological and interpersonal stories throughout Oppenheimer. But I did feel like the movie didn’t try to make me feel like I understood how the atom bomb worked and that left me feeling like I’d missed an enormous part of what exactly was accomplished. I honestly would have preferred to be present for conversations that I didn’t fully understand the first time.

The bulk of the movie was 2 hours of nonstop fast cutting, random 1:1 dialogue between Oppenheimer and side characters, and random jumps in time/location. There was basically no continuity to this story or allowance for the audience to be invested in Oppenheimer or his story.",2023-08-07 18:42:23

"I'm not a Nolan fan.  The only movie of his that I really enjoyed was Momento.  I would have skipped this movie because it was 3 hours long.  But I got talked into a Barbie/Oppie weekend :)

As a tech worker, I think the movie was aimed at people like me.  Many of us in the tech industry are worried about the lack of government response to the tech revolution.  The things we have created have changed life on the planet as we know it.  It's eliminated a ton of jobs through automation.  Tech has made it easy to send false information to the masses.  Tech & social media has helped polarize our politics.  And possibly, worst of all, technology has made it easy for people who already have money to grab even more of it, because they can more easily reach the entire world.  That is creating enormous inequality, anger, poverty, hopelessness, societal instability, and oppression.  

For me, Nolan's movie was commenting on the type of person who creates.  Scientists, programmers.  We are abstract thinkers.  So we are sometimes more comfortable thinking about code/physics than we are thinking about the consequences.  So don't count on us to join the Communists.  We need other types of people thinking about the consequences and regulations, for example, the gov't.  

Unfortunately, the gov't is full of people like Strauss & Truman.  They are there for the power.  And they want power because they are thin-skinned, insecure, and easily feel bad about themselves.  They want that power in order to fill that hole in themselves.  

If this is the nature of leadership, can we count on our leaders to do the right thing?  Or do we need to step up to make ourselves heard?",2023-08-07 22:07:00
"That was a question I asked myself after watching it, ""What was the message of the movie? What point was he trying to make?"" And I couldn't believe that we were supposed to leave the theatre just thinking that atomic bombs were bad, because that's just too obvious, I mean, everyone knows this already.

And I couldn't discern any actual new message or an actual point to the movie. It was just three hours of boredom for me.",2023-08-07 21:11:22
"Well first of all I liked it. I think the movie was really fascinating as a study of a human life and personality that objectively is one of the most important to ever live. The movie had a lot to say to me about the drive for greatness, morality, loyalty, ego and regret. 

Oppy was loyal to a point, moral to a point, in many ways a good man. He sets these things aside to achieve the greatness he was capable of in the Manhattan Project, and the movie functions as a trial of sorts for who he is as a person. Was his essential humanism offset by what he did to weapons development? Is he a loyal person to his friends or not? 

I think his loyalty to his country and the morality of the bomb are sort of mechanisms to allow the audience to ponder the morality and loyalty of Oppenheimer as a man, and there is no correct answer. But any movie that inspires us to think deeply on what is right and wrong is interesting. 

Oppenheimer made me think deeply, I think it was a great movie.",2023-08-07 21:06:50
"> I would like someone to explain to me what they took away

I liked the sentiment Einstein said to Oppenheimer, that people give you awards not to recognize what you've achieved, but to absolve their own guilt. Unfortunately, I don't think this fit into any larger narrative that Nolan wanted to paint, and I agree that the movie gave us virtually nothing to care about.",2023-08-10 01:08:29
"Thankyou! IMO the movie was pretty bad and a horrible example of story telling. I feel like there were at least three good stories that could have been told and NONE of them were told. I feel like they told the story out of chronological order to cover up the fact that they did a horrible job telling a story.  We didn't really see how Oppenheimer was impacted by the McCarthyism and the loss of his security clearance. They just didn't convey it, so I was like ""who cares?""  It was like watching strangers for three hours.

He was a very peculiar character not as iconic as oppenheimer but a worthy advisory the angst and hatred of a man, how he wanted to reign over oppie a fellow jew and how he wanted an H bomb to overdo him and all that.


So many nuances, this movie is truly a masterpiece, not only did he make it 100% accurate and factual but he didnt push the barrier and still showed you lil entries and characters and facets of the time...
Nolan peaked here.",2023-08-14 20:09:35

It's that the bomb was now in the hands of self-serving bureaucrats who are not going to use the bomb to ensure peace but possibly escalate things until the world ends.  Oppenheimer got used and the world is arguably a worse place for his achievement. It's not so much stakes as him having the rug pulled out under him and realizing the world wasn't ready.,2023-07-23 14:01:41
"My feeling is that it was about power and respect, and jealousy. Strauss thought that Oppenheimer revelled in the position of being ""the most important man in the world"" and he hated it. And that was connected to Oppy being acknowledged by Einstein while he himself was ignored, but it was further cemented by Oppy's status after the bomb and his political power as a result of his fame. Strauss was basically hell bent on taking him down a peg.

That's what I took out of it. I think it could have been developed more convincingly though.",2023-07-23 13:56:48
"There are two ""this is not a trial"" scenes. One for Oppenheimer and one for Strauss. It demonstrates how a perceived slight (real or otherwise) can be escalated into an attack. There is no trial, only hearsay and ambiguity.

The way atomic bombs would be used in escalating nuclear war between two countries.

I agree that it wasn't 100% clear, but I like it the more I think about it.",2023-07-29 14:03:41
"The problem was that until Strauss’s motivations were confirmed to be ego and pettiness, you could have been forgiven for waiting for the other shoe to drop, and assuming there was something more to it. Also what Oppenheimer is set to lose (security clearance) is not particularly impactful, as it’s not been clearly shown what he needs that for at this point in his career. Does he even WANT to still work for the military in any capacity? As such, does he really need the clearance? Isn’t he just going to go back to teaching, or some other kinda research?

And fundamentally, however it plays out, the fate of a single middle-aged man’s career is inevitably going to be a thousand times less compelling than “can we split the atom and make a terrifying weapon that could potentially end a world war?”",2023-07-26 10:35:55

Nope.",2023-07-23 13:47:05
"I kind of agree that the conflict wasn’t communicated well. My impression was that mainly they disagreed on development of the H bomb. Oppenheimer was publicly against the H bomb program and as the leader of the atomic energy commission, Strauss wanted to silence him. There also seemed to be some personal vendetta as well… Oppenheimer embarrassed straus and Strauss also felt that Oppenheimer was basking in the attention from creating the bomb. It was also like a microcosm of the overall  political sentiment at the time…the Red Scare meant that anyone not in lockstep agreement with the US was assumed to be a communist sympathizer.",2023-07-23 18:25:04

"This was a very good write-up.

To add to it a little, I felt like the story was told through vignettes.  Bits of dialogue with no actual conversations. There seemed little continuity or time to flesh out any character motivations when they're limited to a few sentences at a time. The time jumping further interrupted any emotional weight being built up.

The movie didn't seem seem to offer any internal exploration of the ethics of creating the weapon until after it was made.  Now, I can readily imagine the significance isn't really felt in full until after the bomb dropped but by not showing how he was able to rationalize it at the time, it makes it appear like he hadn't really considered it.

The nude scenes were provocative but seemed in poor taste as they didn't give Florence Plugh any characterization beyond taciturn communist. It was a visually compelling shot that really sold the intrusive nature of the interrogation but left me a little cold on how underdeveloped her role was.

And finally, I wish there was at least some effort to explain some of the scientific principles which is absolutely fascinating as hell. I would have liked at least a couple of examples of not just the theoretical challenges but also the technical and practical hurdles that had to be overcome. For instance, the gadget that they focus on was an implosion device. To create a super-critical reaction, you need to essentially have highly fissile material close together. A hollow orb of plutonium is stable but if you had the same amount but as a solid ball, it would instantly tear itself apart in an explosion.  So, the technical challenge is to make a hollow orb, it is necessary to surround the entire ball in traditional explosives whose combined force ""implode"" the sphere into a solid.  This had never been done and the challenge is making sure each explosive is perfectly synced to go off at the same time, otherwise one explosion goes off first and scatters everything and preventing an implosion. The other bomb was of a much simpler design and was thought to not even need a test as the result was more or less certain. A movie about scientist doesn't even bother to make the actual science sexy?  One of the best scenes in cinema history is the NASA scientists building the CO2 scrubber in Apollo 13. Fit a square peg in a round hole.",2023-08-11 05:29:49

He thought himself important enough that Oppenheimer would convince Einstein to hate him. He was insecure enough to cling to that moment.

"With very few exceptions (e.g., Teller), the vast majority of the scientific community supported Oppenheimer during the security hearing. After Oppenheimer's clearance was revoked, 494 Los Alamos scientists signed a [petition](https://discover.lanl.gov/news/0602-ribes-petition/) that was sent to Eisenhower and the AEC strongly protesting the decision 

>In Los Alamos, the events felt personal. Said Lab Historian Roger Meade, ""For the junior scientists, Oppenheimer's treatment caused a visceral reaction, and they felt that the Oppenheimer incident was an attack on science, not just [the man]. The sentiment of the scientists was, 'We're here to do science ... and now they're attacking [the man] that led us here.'

Furthermore, Strauss actually released the full transcripts of the security hearing, basically salting the earth after already destroying Oppenheimer's public career.

I agree regarding the actual explosion. Watched this in IMAX on the edge of my seat and it just didn’t capture the reality of how powerful the bomb should’ve been in my opinion.

"Fully in agreement.

It's not bad at all that the movie tried to explore things beyond the war, including some of what Oppenheimer faced later in his life/career. It's that the movie tried to weave a practically full-length political intrigue drama into a story that already had *so many* other elements and *so many* exposition characters.

It's not that I don't think there is a good story in the whole Strauss situation. There just wasn't enough time to elegantly tell it alongside everything else. Times when I was completely ambivalent to something that was supposed to be impactful:

* When his wife screams ""It was Strauss all along!"" and threw the glass. Felt so random and the screenplay up to that point did not make that feel natural.
* Malek's testimony
* When Strauss' aide smugly turned against him at the end, also felt so random
* Einstein coming out of the dark in his sweatpants to weigh in
* His wife giving the ""clever"" testimony that seemingly had no impact on anything whatsoever

I fully believe that with some editing and better writing you could cut out all that political stuff, shorten it way down, and STILL have your cake and eat it too by exploring the scrutiny Oppenheimer faced and his moral dilemmas.",2023-07-24 20:38:28
">Like the personal quarrel of Strauss is a far far less interesting conflict than anything relating to the building of atomic bomb, yet the movie was exclusively focusing on it.

"I think it was kind of the point, almost a meta-narrative. 

Towards the end, when Oppenheimer is watching the slideshow of the effects of the bomb, it focuses only on his face and his reaction to it. At that moment I thought, this movie is so NARROW. Narrow shots, narrow narrative, the conference room is narrow. This is huge, world-shattering stuff. History pivoting on the decisions these men made. So why is so much of the focus on the argument between these 2 men?

But I think that was very intentional on Nolan's part. These are huge, history making decisions, but most of these people are still really focused on their own little bubbles and petty disagreements and individual egos than they are worried about the broader picture. And sometimes those small arguments can influence history in unforeseen ways.

Strauss' whole rant about Oppenheimer wanting to feel important and wanting to be in the limelight was 100% accurate, but he could have just as well been describing himself. His decision to go after Oppenheimer wasn't due to any big moral conviction but simply because Oppenheimer embarrassed him in public.

Oppenheimer asks Groves if he can go with him to Washington, and Groves irritatedly asks, ""why?"" In Groves' eyes, Oppenheimer's contributions are no longer important-- the project has moved beyond his control.

And the aide says to Strauss that Einstein and Oppenheimer were discussing ""something more important""-- an obvious dig that Strauss is not even important enough to be worth talking about.

Einstein seems to be the only one who really understands that he's just one piece of the puzzle, and that he can't control the outcome once those ideas are loose in the world",2023-07-24 19:49:55

"The films ultimate thesis is a critique of Oppenheimer's character: that he tries to have it 'both ways'. Does he have moral scruples? Does he support the H bomb? Is he a communist? 

The subplot with Gene is key to this, both with regards to infidelity and to motivate the reengagement with communists during his time in Los Alamos.

When Kitty sees Gene fucking Oppenheimer in the hearing room, it's also a pretty explicit portrayal of how Oppenheimer is basically letting himself be 'fucked' so he can get off in his strange handwringing martyrdom complex.

"I wouldn't quite say Nolan was hammering home that idea, these are all true events that transpired and affected Oppenheimer deeply.

The criticism displayed towards Oppenheimer in that hearing was not completely without basis, people around Oppenheimer during his time dabbled in Communism and Soviet spies were indeed discovered in Los Alamos.

Even in one of the ""betrayals"" during the hearing, Edward Teller, explicitly said that he did not believe Oppenheimer's loyalties are in question, but probably should not be involved in atomic policies and research given his breach of protocol.

I also felt that Robb's point that Oppenheimer' dissenting views on ""Super"" were inconsistent were also valid - why then he was okay with atomic bombs to begin with? It's not explained in the movie, but I felt that Oppenheimer had personal reasons for that, mainly guilt with how the World is changing due to his work and his wish that it would rather stay unchanged and somewhat familiar to him.

The ""top-down"" hammering of scientists by politicians was also balanced by ""bottom-up"" hammering of Strauss by scientists (Hill with his testimony on Strauss' confirmation hearing).

The only thing I felt that Nolan was hammering down was how large and stupid the Red Scare was - you really had to subscribe to the Western dogma and the Western dogma only in order to stay on top in the US. This remains true even to this day.",2023-07-26 22:24:35
"The war in Japan was arguably already won. I've seen interviews with the Secretary of defense at the time Robert McNamara, who basically said the second bomb was unnecessary, and they dropped it basically because they built two. (If I remember the interview correctly)

Tokyo was already fire bombed into oblivion. The buildings there were still made mostly out of wood, so it went up like crazy, which they touch on in the film for a moment.

"> I'm no longer a fan of Nolan's nonlinear stroy gimmick it was more frustrating to me than adding to the movie

After watching it a couple weeks ago and reading through this thread I still can't figure out why Nolan did it in this movie. Would love to hear his rationale if it's come up in press junkets but overall felt like a cheap trick to manufacture suspense during the final courtroom drama act.

Whereas in Memento, Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk, messing with chronology / time is directly motivated by the plot (skipped Tenet so can't really comment on that but from the trailers it seems to fit too).",2023-09-12 03:51:39

Strauss was a petty, vainglorious hardline conservative who deeply distrusted anyone with different beliefs from him and took it as a personal affront when anyone contradicted him directly. The isotopes thing was absolutely one of the reasons why he went after Oppenheimer, because it was a public humiliation from the most prominent scientific mind at the time.

"I'm a massive Nolan fan, and I've seen every movie he's made multiple times, including Oppenheimer, but I was kind of disappointed too. I'm glad people enjoyed it, by-and-large, and I'm not going to attempt to combat the Reddit general hivemind on how amazing it was on this one, so I'm just replying to your more-recent comment lol.

The meat/crux of the movie is pretty good/interesting, the stuff with Oppenheimer coming up and then at Los Alamos. The 1954 private hearing framing device and, especially, the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing framing device add a *lot* of runtime for very little payoff IMO. I never, at any point in the film, gave a fuck about Lewis Strauss, his opinions on anyone, or if he's going to be the Secretary of Commerce. And why should I? In the story of the atomic bomb and Oppenheimer, he is at *best* a minor footnote. A guy Oppy insulted so he hated him. And he gets \~1/3 of an already-long movie? Totally unnecessary, cut his scenes.

The 1954 private hearing stuff is at least more pertinent to Oppenheimer's later life and guilt over the creation of the atomic bomb, but it also felt unnecessarily long and drawn-out without a ton of payoff into Oppy's psyche. Stuff that feels like it could've been conveyed more succinctly with stuff like the fantastic audience scene with Oppy's guilt/PTSD flashing in.

Together, those 2 framing devices are a *lot* of runtime, I estimate about an hour and a half, and they just simply don't need to take up so much time or even, I'd argue, be part of the movie, when it comes to the Strauss stuff. We can have Oppy's life story and him interacting with all of these great scientists without any Strauss. I just don't understand what it adds to the movie. It feels like a huge subplot that's just taking up space and runtime.",2023-11-26 10:08:25

"That whole scene was the questioner trying to call out Oppenheimer on his hypocrisy. He was shouting at him to pressure him into admitting that he never cared about the horrific consequences of building the atom bomb. Oppenheimer basically admits there that he built it only to be used against the Nazis, but was willfully blind about where it would go after the Nazis lost. 

That whole commission was to smear Oppenheimer's image, so any statement he made to make himself look like a hypocrite would be good enough for them.",2023-07-21 19:17:02
"it's not about his security clearance, but what the security clearance and trial represent. It's about his loss of control, the inner turmoil he experiences, and his realization that he created a chain reaction that he can't control and how reckless he now realizes that may have been, because he is powerless to stop it.",2023-07-23 16:30:16
"It was incredibly devastating for him. He felt he served his country loyally for years and was stabbed in the back by the government. It made him unable to work as a nuclear physicist again due to his newfound infamy. He responded by spending most of his remaining time on St John in the US Virgin Islands.

The hearing was seen as a real watershed moment for the scientific community. Oppenheimer attained a degree of public and political influence as a scientist after 1945 that has never been matched before or since in American history. A lot of people consider him to be emblematic of a brief period of technocracy, when the experts were in charge of scientific and technological policy. After his clearance was removed the military was firmly in charge of the nuclear program. 

A lot of scientists took Oppenheimer's treatment by the AEC personally, they felt it was an attack on their expert authority. They saw the trial as not about genuine concerns about security but a plot to diminish the credibility of scientists in the public eye and ostracize them from the policymaking process.",2023-07-23 16:43:21

"I read American Prometheus about a year ago and am going off of recollections off the top of my head, so definitely fact check me. But they built multiple bombs at Los Alamos (you see them trucking the other models/ Little Boy + Fat Man components out in the film after the test when Groves departs). 

As for fissionable materials/ enriched plutonium + uranium, they continued to escalate production over time (started as a trickle, became a flood). I think when discussing project locations Groves mentions “breaking ground in Tennessee” for their refinery, they kept building, upscaling production, and improving in the following years. Some of it was done in other facilities in Canada for instance (bulk of it in Tennessee to my knowledge). Within an alarmingly short timeline the the US was able to stockpile more and more atomic weapons:

1945 = 2 bombs

Edit: the 2 billion Groves kept referencing in the film was mostly spent on creating fissile materials and building factories for that purpose. Only a small fraction actually went into the actual design/ R+D aspects of the project",2023-07-28 06:02:15
"The movie very subtly implies that the aide played by Alden Ehrenreich leaked the info to Dr. Hill. Remember how Strauss was adamant that Alden's character find out the identity of the unknown scientist witness? 

In reality, Hill learned what happened from reading the transcripts of the security tribunal, which took place five years before the Strauss confirmation hearings. Despite promises to keep the tribunal confidential, Strauss had leaked the transcripts, causing further humiliation to the Oppenheimers, who after having their private business exposed in the tribunal then had the indignity of them being made public. The security tribunal not only devastated Oppenheimer on a personal level, but the tribunal was a huge controversy in the physics/scientific community at the time. Many physicists did hate Strauss for what he did. Some historians have argued that the Oppenheimer affair impeded development in weapons and energy because it actively scared off physicists from working for/collaborating with the U.S. government again. Teller was ostracized by colleagues for his perceived betrayal of Oppenheimer and sucking up to Strauss.

Hill's dialogue in the hearings in the movie comes almost verbatim from the real David Hill's actual Congressional testimony.",2023-08-06 07:42:17
">I think it was a mistake to give so much screen time to the Strauss/hearing stuff, especially so early on. It just felt like it was weighing down what could have been a tight, sharp story about Oppenheimer's early life and the Manhattan Project.

I agree with you. The most compelling parts of the movie were undoubtedly when they were actually building and testing the bomb itself. Ultimately, the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance was an insignificant historical event and most people barely remember it today, and if they do it's mostly viewed as a product of Cold War paranoia. They kept emphasizing that Oppenheimer's ""credibility"" would be ruined if it happened but didn't really show what that really meant. He was never formally charged or jailed, was still respected as a scientist, credited as the father of the bomb, and got an award many years later (as the movie shows). And who cares if Lewis Strauss didn't get confirmed to the cabinet? Almost nobody today remembers who he was. The acting by everyone (including Rami Malek) is splendid but the historical stakes were honestly quite low, so it took away from the gravitas. 

On the other hand, the star-studded cast of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project and their discoveries and inventions are still remembered and used today - Einstein, Bohr, Lawrence, Rabi, Bethe, Feynman, Fermi, Alvarez, Blackett, Heisenberg, Szilard, Teller (more than half of these are Nobel Prize winners)...these people would come to define 20th century physics, and we barely learn anything about them other than Oppenheimer himself and a little bit of Einstein, Rabi, and Lawrence. It would probably have been more interesting if they kept the focus on the personal and scientific drama while building the bomb. For example, developing the Oppenheimer-Teller drama could have been more interesting (rather than with Strauss, who's not even a scientist or significant person). Or Oppenheimer-Lawrence (communist theorist vs. conservative experimentalist). Or they could have instead explored the humanitarian aspect - such as the devastating aftereffects of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",2023-07-25 01:53:01
"Was going to make a post, but you prepeated most of what I was going to say. :)

For me, it was an odd movie. The Trinity Test what what I expected, and really enjoyed. While that was very good, extremely tense and well-shot, just about everything else felt really jumbled and rambling. 

Strauss was almost the protagonist of the movie, and the Manhattan project seemed overshadowed by a security clearance hearing in a small room. The whole 'Oppenheimer was associating with risky people' point seemed to be repeated over and over and over needlessly. 

The actual dropping of the bombs weren't featured at all. The jumping between 3 time periods was a little confusing. Einstein was almost introduced as comic relief, stumbling into scenes randomly. And the focus on that one conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein - was that a random Nolan creation? 

In some ways, I thought it was an attempt to parallel his story with Turing's - which makes some sense given the commonalities. But for me the film was a disjointed focus on the less interesting aspects of a man's life and passing over much of the most fascinating.",2023-07-25 00:13:17

"About the nuke scene, Cameron did an excellent job in T2, it is still mesmerising, but Nolan’s approach is different, realistic, not entirely fictional. The cheering scene after the Hiroshima bombing where Oppenheimer has those vivid hallucinations, for me it’s up to Linda Hamilton’s scene. It is a very subtle moment of horror, an intimate turmoil of the mind. Visually perhaps isn’t as spectacular as Cameron’s judgement day but knowing that it is based on actual events and people, that scenes is even more shocking.",2023-07-25 00:25:19

"Strauss had a vendetta against oppenheimer largely from that hearing as you said. But also from them competing for the Princeton job where oppenheimer was ranked higher than him. Both of these are depicted in the film. They also just had personal and political beef around their religion and political stances. 

Ultimately Strauss didn’t trust oppenheimer and had the FBI spy on him. This all leads to him recommending they revoke the security clearance which is also depicted in the film. 

Largely because of this personal attack on oppenheimer the scientific community was against Strauss on the Eisenhower cabinet and he ultimates was rejected which humiliated him.

"He was working as director at the Institute for Advanced Study, which provides their director with housing on-site (and where he and Kitty lived for around 15 years, and raised their two children). He made a number of controversial decisions and the board was considering calling for his resignation, and he correctly suspected Strauss, who was also a board member at the Institute, would use the result of the security clearance hearing (and anti-Communist momentum) against him. 

He didn’t want to turn out like his brother and so many of his colleagues, who never again found work in, or even related to, the field of physics. And he feared that if he didn’t get the outcome he desired, that is exactly what Strauss would do to him.",2023-07-23 20:19:00

He used his position to express his opposition to the H Bomb as well as advocating for international nuclear arms control - something that would inherently diminish the control the military would have on nukes. These policy stances were something that Strauss and many hardline conservatives in Washington and the military could not abide. 

So Strauss set out to eliminate Oppenheiner from ever having any say in nuclear policy ever again by initiating a closed door hearing that would relitigate his well known communist ties, with the odds completely stacked against Oppie.

"As an American I kept thinking during the movie about what others thought, particularly a Japanese person, about the depiction of America’s reasoning for using the atomic bomb. So I guess I find it ironic to find you wondering what an American thinks.
Growing up I bought fully into the conservative, “patriotic” line that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were justified. I now feel very confused about what should have been done. I honestly just choose not to have an opinion because it is easier than doing the appropriate amount of research to fall on one side or the other. And honestly can a definitive decision even be made? The idea that more lives were saved by the use of the atomic bomb, can that even be validated? Or is it offensive to even suggest the idea? I just don’t know.
Ultimately I liked the depiction of Oppenheimer being conflicted himself because that’s were I am at. The movie makes me want to read the book that inspired the movie American Prometheus. I would like at least one other source for the many different characters opinions and motivations.
I’m looking at your last question and I don’t think I answered it yet. Was Japan a victim? Absolutely! Was Japan a total victim? I don’t know. I do think the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were total victims. I kind of wanted to see some depiction of the actual destruction but I’m okay with the choice to only show Oppenheimer’s reaction.",2023-07-24 21:26:03
"As an American I felt like the movie was a different perspective then we normally get. I appreciated a scientific point of view and how it was viewed at the time as a scientific achievement. Knowing it was built because of the nazis and that a lot of the scientist were Jewish made the whole project development make much more sense to me. 

Honestly I wish no city would have been bombed. And that there would have been no reason for one (Nazis messed up so many things). 

I understand Einsteins approach. Just because the knowledge is there, there’s a certain sense of morality in not developing/giving others that power. 

I also felt like Oppenheimer went through an internal battle/struggle with knowing he was unleashing a power no one had ever seen but trying to offset that with reminding himself it’s an defensive measure to the Nazis. But in the end it was used more in an offense sense rather than defense 

I think the bombings were still a major tragedy. So many innocent people lost their lives on a grand scale. I don’t know what it would have looked like with a refusal to surrender from Japan, but kind of like Oppenheimer says he feels he has blood on his hands — you can’t deny that there’s a sense of guilt. I feel it as an American and I wasn’t even born when that decision was made. 

I think the movie also shows the importance of nuclear de proliferation and importance of communication and cooperation with the international community. In some ways nuclear weapons helped stop major world wars and achieved a certain level of peace within Europe. And nuclear weapons, along with open dialogue has certainly stopped Russia and America from going to war.",2023-07-24 20:45:14
"Japan was actually very close to surrendering, a concerted effort by the Americans to obtain a surrender would have been successful, especially if the Americans would have promised Hirohito would not be killed (which ended up happening anyway). You could say that a cultural/language barrier as part of the problem.  Basically, America said ""surrender unconditionally"" which the Japanese relied ""yes we will surrender unconditionally but with just a few conditions"" and then Americans said ""no you must surrender unconditionally"".  And like I said, they ended up dropping the bombs and yet still letting the Japanese keep their emperor.

However, there is NO WAY that america was going to simply not use the bomb after all that investment, they considered just showing it off as a show of force (mainly for leverage against the Russians) but decided it must be used against a city. Again, they were dropped mainly for getting leverage against the Russians.",2023-07-24 21:00:40

"I felt somewhat the same as you the first time I saw it, as if the part with Strauss and the interrogation were sort of tacked on at the end and didn't really fit with the front end of the film. The second time I watched it, I realized that the interrogation is the film, and that it was better for it. We are left to judge Oppenheimer and his motives, and the kangaroo-court interrogation allows us to feel some pity for him, but it also is the only point at which Oppenheimer is forced to face his own contradictions about the development of the A-bomb, the H-bomb, and his role in it. He is forced into making the somewhat absurd claim that his moral qualms about the H-bomb were based on his belief that there were too many H-bombs built relative to the number of A-bombs. We see in his face how he has avoided this reckoning all along.

This section plays another, related role in the movie, I think. In that first half, focused on the building of the bomb, Oppenheimer is surging forward under the power of his own genius, determination, and optimism, but in the second part, which could be said to begin with the departure of the bombs from Los Alamos, he starts to sense his own powerlessness, in the face of bureaucracy, the rising military-industrial complex, and the logic of the technology itself. 

He keeps on talking about how this is not a new weapon but a new world, but we see that he never really got it himself, just in the way Einstein couldn't see past his own accomplishments. He had demolished the old world, but was never able to cross into the Promised Land, to mix metaphors.

More specifically, Nolan is using the kangaroo court about Oppenheimer's clearance (and the kangaroo court around Strauss's nomination) as a lens to judge Oppenheimer himself (and Strauss too), not in the abstract sense of whether they were 'good' or 'bad', but primarily within the context of their actions surrounding the development and deployment of WMDs.

Furthermore, this trick on Nolan's part is itself part of a larger trick he is playing on the audience: we judge Oppenheimer from the safety of our seats in the movie theater and 80 years removed. But, the truth is we collectively make the identical decisions Oppenheimer did, day in, day out. We build weapons well in excess of the power that anything he built and we build them on an industrial scale. Nobody really has an issue with this anymore. We are completely at home with these weapons. 

At its most basic level, the movie is about us and the bomb. Oppenheimer is the lens through which we focus on that, because the question is too large for most of us (perhaps for any of us) to confront objectively. I think there are lots of other wonderful things going on in this movie, to be sure, but I think the structure of the movie is sound, and I was convinced of this on the second watching.",2023-08-12 19:32:38

Oppenheimer met Einstein in the wood was at the beginning of the project.

Einstein didn't want to have anything to do with it though he knew mathematically it's possible (the wood conversation). Oppenheimer pushed through it and he told Einstein by the pond thst the destruction has started.

From my perspective, the chain reaction is not only referring to the A-bomb itself but an entirely new page on the history of mass destructive weapons. Countries will be on a massive army race after those events, and newly created with even stronger destructive forces will be created rapidly. And eventually, the A-bomb that Oppenheimer created ironically became the beginning of the end for the world.

"There is an extremely brief line in the meeting where they are selecting the targets that alluded to that context of the psychology of justifying using the bomb, but I'm surprised they left it there.

A general or someone there talks about 100,000 dead in the firestorm in Tokyo (referencing Operation Meetinghouse). This was a firebombing operation, and Tokyo as a mostly wooden city, turned into a blaze killing more than would be killed in the immediate blast of either atomic bombs they were discussing. I think the general then said something about the American public's acceptance of that level of killing and that Pearl Harbor bought a lot of leeway with the public.

This to me is a critical detail that could have been further explored. By this stage in the war, inhumanity and brutality was normalized step by step until the atomic bomb was a huge psychological step but not that much further morally than the mechanized scientifically driven murder that the world had somehow gotten numb to.

A million moving pieces that you would need an enormous screen to see every detail. Nah. Instead the majority of the movie are shots of people from the waist up and close up shots of faces.

I don't necessarily think that the point of the film was to ask the audience the question 'is Oppy a communist?', but instead to let the events of the cross-examination play out infront of the audience as a spectator. I wonder how it would have come out if it had made that challenge, perhaps using screen time dedicated to the Strauss plot to play into the ambiguity of whether Oppy's post-atomic bomb actions that seek to redeem him are based on a true desire to save people from a terrible death, or because of his own ideological interest.",2023-08-05 23:18:17

Your criticisms on dialogue are issues Nolan has long been criticized for / plagued with. I remember hearing this all the way back when the Prestige came out and thinking nothing of it. It finally clicked for me like a light bulb when I saw Interstellar.

Even me as a big Nolan fan could not excuse when Matt Damon's character, after he is awoken, says something to the effect of ""pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face"". After that moment I finally understood what all the criticism with his dialogue is about. It came across so unnatural and frankly cringe.

At this point I've just come to accept that's Nolan's way of writing dialogue. It is what it is. This film definitely had it but I guess it didn't bother me as I was expecting it. I also think it actually worked somewhat here since it's a biopic and I applaud when Biopics break the rules of traditional film/storytelling, since to me that's somewhat needed to make them interesting (they shouldn't fit a typical story structure, after all). So I felt this was one of Nolan's only movies where the clonky dialogue and awkward chaotic editing actually worked to its favour.",2023-08-09 09:46:40

I believe Christopher Nolan makes his best movies when his brother Jonathan Nolan writes them.

I hope they collaborate again, because I greatly enjoy The Prestige, but I did not care for Oppenheimer.",2023-08-10 00:09:44

"> they overstate the fear of igniting the atmosphere

Agreed. It's not in the film, but in the book the film is inspired by there's a documented private conversation in which Oppenheimer says to a friend that living a life as slaves to the Nazis would be preferable to burning the whole world. This was well before any prototype to the bomb being built, but it would have been very fitting to have that in the film.

"I want to congratulate you on your honesty. I too felt the blast was a bit mediocre, and I wanted and expected it to be something that took my breath away. Instead, we got a cloud of fire; yes, it's technically correct, but it didn't even resemble a mushroom cloud. Yes,  it was a close-up, but it was not terrifying like many said it would be. The netrons firing inside the cloud were also a bit off putting since thats nothing that you see in real life. They added it to remind you of splitting atoms.

&#x200B;

I'm also not impressed with the number of flashes of atoms splitting, building up to the atomic bomb inside Oppenheimer's head. It looked like a made up imaginary image done with a dance of lights and a long shot camera capture effect. very much the opposite of a scientific approach, like the black hole in Interstellar. I was left feeling unimpressed and not inspired by the subject matter at all.

&#x200B;

My third complaint goes to the choice of not explaining the science very well. I'm specifically thinking of the scene where Oppenheimer gets the news that a successful split of atoms has been made. There was a line where Oppenheimer says, now every physicist in the world is thinking about the same thing ""a bomb"" yes true, but the audience does not do that leap automatically. It would be very interesting to give it a few minutes to explain to the audience how Einstein's E=mc2 equation defines how much energy splitting an atom releases, and given how small they are and how many can fit in a gram(g). It would mean an enormous amount of power when the mass is measured in kilos. If this were done in a cinematic way without letting the audience know it was trying to educate them, then the actual scene where the first bomb went off would have so much more impact. i believe.",2023-07-25 09:13:39
"I know it's a biopic about Oppenheimer, but, yes, more or less entirely glossing over the Japanese victims in order to focus on the ""is he a commie"" questioning was...it was a bad choice. I'll just say it.

I especially feel this way given Putin's recent nuclear saber-rattling. Film doesn't exist in a vacuum; remind people what's at stake if we forget about the mistakes of the past. ""History isn't a story of the past; it's a description of the present,"" (or something very much like this, can't remember it verbatim) was a prominent line in the film, after all.",2023-07-30 21:33:51

I thought timelines until later in the movie when some of the once black and white scenes were in color. My best take is that the black and white scenes were always from Strauss (Robert Downey Jr)’s perspective while the color scenes were Oppenheimer’s first person perspective,2023-07-21 20:47:06
"He was from the Chicago group of scientists rather than Los Alamos, which Strauss took as a good sign for two reasons: He didn’t have the strong relationship and hero worship of Oppenheimer that a lot of the Los Alamos scientists did, and the Chicago scientists were upset with Oppenheimer for not signing the petition on the use of nuclear weapons.

Remember that Rami Malek’s character was the one who physically tried to hand him the petition and Oppenheimer smacked it away.",2023-07-22 01:36:57

"Didn't see it in ""true"" IMAX but the mixing was terrible. Whenever music was playing, which was like 90% of the film, it was *very* hard to follow the dialogue. My wife is a non-native speaker and the film was incomprehensible to her for this reason.

This is a recurring problem with Nolan's films that he doesn't seem to have much interest in fixing.

The Japanese knew the war had been lost since the Marianas Turkey Shoot. They were betting everything on a conditional surrender that would allow them to keep their imperial system and autonomy. They couldn't beat the US but they can bleed the US until the American public gets sick of it all and is willing to settle for peace.

In the film, as in real life, Oppenheimer and Strauss disagreed over whether selling radioisotopes for medical purposes to other countries was a risk to U.S. security. Oppenheimer could be very condescending about those he thought were below him in intelligence (which was almost everyone) and as the movie shows, Oppenheimer made a cutting remark/joke in a Congressional hearing about Strauss' views, which Strauss found humiliating.

The movie was too fucking long, the third act draaaaaaagged. The first act was pretty hard to follow, lots of scientists and random friends (I still don't know who exactly the people were that they left their kid with). Rami Malek's presence was very distracting because obviously he was gonna come back for some big reveal.

"This. It worked for action movies but this was just a political drama. The editing jumping around in between dialogues with loud action strings for what is othewise normal conversations got tiresome fast.

The dialogue included so many cringe philosophical quotes over the most mundane topics it sounded like self-parody at times.

It was unnecessarily long yet what would have been the most crucial moments like the Japan bombings, Hitler's invasion and the German surrender are mentioned in passing (Nagasaki and the period in between both bombings are barely mentioned), makes it feel really rushed at the end.

It'd also never made clear if he actually felt remorse for what he created or saw it as necesary other than with those dumb flashing colors scenes that are suppossed to mean PTSD. He's shown to be worried for the H-bomb, as if killing 80.000 instead of 200.000 somehow made him more ethical. The effects of a nuclear bomb are never even shown other than the mentioning of a death toll (one of his flashes showing a girl's skin peeling off and that's it). The only explosion shown looks like a slightly larger than normal explosion. In between all this, we're suppossed to care for a random politician and his political play against Oppenheimer, this is dragged on for the entire movie and at the end he's randomly saved by a random scientist we saw for two 20 seconds scenes before  (Rami Malek) who for some reason knows about the politician's entire plot, never being explained how and why did everyone believe him.

The movie was more about the red scare than his actual creation. This persecution is shown as a politician's personal vendetta but the movie does acknowledge Oppenheimer had a shitload of communist connections and activities yet his only punishment was his clearance being revoked.",2023-11-19 16:01:21

Which is kind of the point: Strauss felt belittled by Oppenheimer and ""his kind"" (the scientific community), and he couldn't get past that or believe it wasn't about him.

"I had to look it up on Wikipedia because it didn't make a ton of sense to me either.

Strauss was a man who believed that anyone that disagreed with him was a traitor to the United States. They touch on it a bit with the meeting about the Soviet A-Bomb, but throughout the late 40s - early 50s Oppenheimer made several statements about how far he believed the Russians were behind the US's nuclear program. When those beliefs ended up being incorrect by increasing magnitude (i.e. In 1953 he claimed the USSR was four years behind them on the H-bomb, but only a month later they detonated a device that appeared at first to be a thermonuclear weapon), Strauss concluded that Oppenheimer was secretly a Russian spy and had his friend Hoover begin to build a case against him.

"They make it pretty clear why him losing clearance is such a big deal though, because he basically loses all his influential power.",2023-07-23 03:49:33
"Agree!  (Spoilers below...)

Absolutely loved a lot of the movie -- building the town, recruiting the physicists, getting the resources, and building the bomb. Blown away by the test, the speech after the bomb dropped, the conversation with Truman, and of course the ending. The film's depiction of the moral issues associated with ""creating fire"" was pitch perfect.  
  
But so much of the movie was about the communist angle and the potential revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. I understand that the movie is called ""Oppenheimer"", and that this is a big part of Oppenheimer's life. But here are my complaints:  
  
The bomb is unquestionably the main story here, whether Nolan wants it to be or not. It's hard for an audience to care about an hour of politics (involving a political figure nobody particularly cares about) when the bomb takes center stage during the second act.  
  
Yes, it's (probably) a tragedy that Oppenheimer gets his clearance revoked, but why should the audience care? The guy was a theoretical physicist who did a job very well, and as the movie tells it he definitely didn't live his life like a saint. Was he actually going to be a great politician or make a difference if he got his clearance and spoke up more?  He bit his tongue in a critical meeting depicted by the movie. Why should the audience care about Oppenheimer getting sidelined politically in the 1950s?  
  
The overarching plot (involving the ""is he a communist"" investigation) has been portrayed in so many other movies, for so many decades, that it's unclear why the audience would care that much even if it actually believed that Oppenheimer was essential to politics in the 1950s. How many films have already portrayed unjust hearings, imprisonments, and worse during the McCarthy era? We have literally seen that movie before, many times.  

  
Bottom line, I wished the movie had focused more on the physics, the creation of Los Alamos, and the mechanics of building and testing the bomb. The film does an absolutely brilliant job of capturing the moral complexities Oppenheimer confronted after the bombs dropped -- that's the movie's main virtue IMO, and it deserves all the praise in the world for brilliantly portraying those complexities in gut-wrenching detail.  It just felt like the entire plot line involving Robert Downey Jr.'s character was a misfire, unnecessarily elevating a historical footnote to parity with one of the most consequential moments in modern history.",2023-07-23 03:47:58

"> Oppie had mentioned again to Einstein the possibility of destroying the planet by burning the atmosphere.

Minor distinction. The scene was Oppenheimer and Einstein recalling the discussion about the possibility that it could occur. With Oppenheimer now viewing it as a certainty. Not because of a scientific chain reaction, but instead because of politics and human nature.

After Hiroshima, he went up on the stage to speak to his fellow scientists and engineers a somber man. Traumatized by what was done. and nearly every one of them *applauded* and *cheered*. Everyone in that room was learned individuals. Fully understanding the implications. Whether due to pride in their accomplishment or fear of the 'other'. They fell prey to mob mentality.

That's why he spent the rest of his life arguing and pleading to end nuclear proliferation. He didn't want to have started the chain reaction that would end the world.",2023-08-03 14:36:33

Yeah exactly that. I get that Nolan doesn't like CGI but when it actually makes the movie worse maybe you should move on from that...,2023-07-21 22:28:01
That whole sequence was disappointing. They hyped up Nolan going to use a real atomic bomb! That was weak tbh.,2023-07-21 21:28:48
Agree felt the same the only let down of the movie,2023-07-21 21:25:24
Nolan said he did not use CGI so they probably just did blow up a big barrel of gasoline. It was very disappointing to me as I am a big fan of the 90's film Trinity and Beyond that has actual footage of nuclear tests and the explosion in this film was just nowhere near how powerful the real thing looks like,2023-07-21 21:29:55

"Yeah it was disappointing. It's going to sound like fanboy cope, but the movie really was dedicated to the humanity surrounding the bomb and dealing with the before and after of the Project. So I could say the explosion itself ""wasn't the point"" of the movie.

The nuclear fireball itself was there, but only tiny snippets in the very beginning.

A lot of folks will find the movie boring because it is not a nuclear fireworks display. As the film concluded I felt like Nolan was trying to do justice for a complicated man who was wronged by his government and unfairly attacked. I like what he has done here.

After Tenet I am convinced Nolan has an inflated ego, and he clearly overhyped the practical explosion. I was expecting a full beginning-to-end depiction of the fireball. A slow motion underwater explosive charge, miniatures, etc.",2023-07-22 00:49:51

I felt the movie could've done without most of the Strauss plot, honestly.

"there's a reason the film is called Oppenheimer, not The Manhattan Project or anything else; the film is about his entire life, including but not limited to his creation of atomic bomb. i personally think the last hour of the film is the best part.

"I think the Strauss plot is explained by Blunt's character's line near the end: 

""Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you the world would forgive you?""

IMO the film works better once you realize than the Manhattan project was never meant to be the main story. It's rather an explorarion Oppenheimer's mind during those events and how conflicted he was. 

Strauss was right partly too. When you watch Oppenheimer before the Trinity test, he never shown much doubt towards the bomb development. It was only after the test and bombings that he started feeling the enormous guilt and changed his position almost 180 degrees.",2023-07-27 10:37:20

it's a shame, in the middle 3rd when it actually quiets down, breathes, and the actors are allowed to stretch their legs a bit it's quite good.. then of course there's the totally out of left field tacked on oceans-11-ass ending that was so poorly executed i was actually giggling. suddenly this whole thing is some corny whodunnit?",2023-09-15 02:07:42
"I just finished watching it (about 15min ago) and this was my exact impression. Good movie! Did not like the editing over what felt like most of the film. It almost felt like the director didn’t trust the material to hold the audience’s attention, and relied on quick cuts to keep eyes from drifting away, and make it more ‘interesting’. 

The other thing that bothered me was that the characters felt very one note all the way through, which is really odd when you’re following essentially the whole cast over two decades or more. I also didn’t really care the relationships very much. There’s a lot of interpersonal conflict, but if you don’t have much of a connection to the characters, it hard to be invested. Emily Blunt’s character really stood out to me in this way, mostly because her brief, punctuated scenes featured her as ‘angry drunk Kitty’ for half the movie. I adore Emily Blunt, she was acting her butt off, but between the editing and lack of character development, it felt very jarring to me. 

I enjoyed it, I would recommend watching it, but I don’t think it’s quite top tier - nor the best Nolan film. If I could make one change, it would be to focus more on just a few key relationships. More Emily Blunt - I would have loved to learn more about Kitty Oppenheimer! Why did she become an alcoholic? Why was she so pissed off all the time? On her wiki article, apparently due to her substance use disorder, she developed attacks of acute pancreatitis that led to angry outbursts. So I suppose it did lead me to reading more about her, but I wanted to watch a film about people, not caricatures.",2024-01-03 06:43:17
"This movie was as exciting as reading a new fact someone is researching on wikipedia. LOL.

I love slow films and character studies but Nolan's style is more and more becoming similar to Snyders' with his 3 recent films. Its all style at the expense of good story telling. 

I hope Killers of the Flower Moon get all the awards it deserves.",2024-01-07 08:34:33
"I think the artistic direction was to show that carnage in the director (Opp's) face.

I'd rank this just below The Dark Knight in terms of Nolan films. It was long but never arduous, and yes, had a lot of dialogue, but the pacing was beyond perfect and I was never bored.

Also I feel like I learned a lot.

The stakes of Oppenheimer's security clearance (what was he planning on doing with it?) as well as the true personal motivations of the people who consipred to deny him are muddy... Is he genuinely suspected of being a communist or are those in government afraid that he's become too critical of nuclear weapons proliferation and smearing him as a means of silencing him? Why do the scientists whose concerns about the atom bomb he dismissed pre-Hiroshima come to his defense during his and Strauss's respective hearings? 

All in all, the penultimate sequence of the movie (Oppenheimer's denial of his security clearance and Strauss's denial of his cabinet position) played like a hamfisted courtroom drama/historical reenactment and drained the movie of much of the energy and tension that it successfully built over the preceding three hours. The final sequence of Oppenheimer and Einstein at the pond and Oppenheimer's visions of nuclear holocaust was effectively disturbing enough to serve as a bit of a palate cleanser.",2023-08-20 19:05:44

"I was expecting the emotional journey of being the person who invented the atom bomb, as a character study and this wasn't it. It neither reflected the intensity of his mental anguish (both before and after) nor the immense diety like quality of the bomb he ascribed it. I went into it as a character study and was still very underwhelmed.

He is famous for his citing of the Bhagavadgita in describing himself or perhaps humanity, in relation to the invention. Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. This historical moment is boiled down to a ""read it to me while we bang"" scene. 

His incredible breadth of his skillset was key in developing the bomb, he had a remarkable intuition of many fields of science, not just physics, which helped make the bomb possible. None of that is shown, there are a few detonator tests and suddenly the feat of engineering, that is only possible due to Oppenheimer's character, is just suddenly done and built.

Imagine making a movie about the Wright brothers and skipping them figuring out how to build the plane. It's such a strange concept to me you'd choose that for a character study.

I thought the movie was _too_ close to ""awesome war footage and explosions"", while somehow weirdly being mostly legal talk. I was going into a movie about Oppenheimer showing depth and forethought and got a shallow fast paced court drama and stereotypical sex scenes. I don't know, a man who learns Sanskrit for fun doesn't strike me as the guy who has the most vanilla sex possible but I'm digressing.

I get that it's a character study, my point is just that it wasn't a very good or accurate character study and misses the point of what makes the real life Oppenheimer a captivating story.",2023-07-28 10:03:38

Russia was allied at the time so there was no particular reason they should be doing that. 

It was a coincidence that Casey’s character happened to get there while Oppenheimer was attending other matters and proceeded to call him in to expand further on those concerns.

I think the main take away is that people were getting killed and being treated subhuman for having any kind of connection with communism and Oppenheimer is more of a naïve well meaning person only concerned with truth who didn’t realize how dangerous it was. He’s incapable of not being himself, and was in front of someone who was just a cold, blooded murderer. I think it’s in keeping with the theme of the movie where Oppenheimer is just exploring intellectual theory, and doesn’t understand what will happen in practice.  

He had intellectual friends who were variously playing with or were invested in communism, but didn’t realize what was at stake. and that his life may have been in Jeopardy.

I don’t think we can see him as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, he’s both. It’s ‘good’ that he invented the device that ended the war, it’s also simultaneously ’bad’ that it took 200,000 civilian deaths to do it.

It was only really an issue in a handful of places throughout the film, though, and usually just a word or two that were difficult to comprehend. I mostly found myself taking an extra beat and relying on the context of what came next to process some lines here and there.

Later, he tells her not to take in the sheets because (I think) he doesn't think he'll ""win"" the non-trial.",2023-07-24 03:36:02

"The original chain reaction was meant quite literally. They drop the bomb the reaction doesn't stop the world is literally destroyed.

"It's about recognizing that their contributions to science created something that would inevitably evolve beyond their control. The new generation of scientists only comes to acknowledge their contributions because it bolsters up their own potential discoveries, Oppenheimer gave Einstein an award at Berkeley because Einstein's achievements paved the way for what would be his own.",2023-07-24 19:10:39
"I think a good illustration of the thing Einstein was talking about is the fact that the US government fairly recently vacated the results of Oppenheimer’s hearing and said that rescinding his security clearance was a mistake.

Who is that decision for? Oppenheimer is long dead, so it isn’t for him. Practically speaking, announcing such a decision doesn’t affect anything at all, and certainly doesn’t do anything for Oppenheimer who would be the nominal beneficiary of such a decision.

The point is that when we honor someone, in general but especially well after the fact, the award is more about the people giving the award than the person receiving it. Sometimes they receive a tangible benefit for doing so by associating with the person in question. Often it’s as simple as just making themselves feel good for doing it.

But one way or another, award ceremonies often aren’t about you, even when “you” are the one receiving the award.",2023-07-24 19:36:17

"I interpreted it as the award is more about getting past the fact that they dragged his name through the dirt, not his accomplishments. This is evidenced by an aged Teller shaking his hand. The last time Teller did this he could barely look him in the eye.

However, Oppenheimer arrives to find that Niels Bohr is in the classroom, and has grabbed the apple instead.

When the format switched over to IMAX there was a noticeable improvement in image quality that I don't think I've seen in any other movie. It was like a super HD image.

"I felt underwhelmed by the *lack* of character study, specifically post bomb drop. We see a lot of Cillian Murphy looking sad in a room, but I feel there's only two really good shots where we get to see how he *feels* after the bomb drop: the speech with the face melting and charred body, and the nuclear light bleeding into the room in the board meeting. I wanted more of that surrealism which is why I felt a bit underwhelmed. 

That and so because we basically an entire plotline for Strauss, a character whose only relevance is that he set up the dominoes for Oppenheimer's security clearance evaluation. I didn't care about his failed appointment to a cabinet position cause this movie isn't about him, it's about Oppenheimer. I get that he's an important figure in the grand scheme of things, but if this is a biopic, then we should be focused on Oppenheimer specifically. This added plotline didn't really add anything to me in the long run, especially when the last line of that plotline ends with, ""Maybe they weren't talking about you. Maybe they were talking about something more important."". Like, yeah guy, you're right, this is Oppenheimer's fuckin' movie, why are we wasting an hour on this guy? I don't care that he set up the domino's for the clearance meeting, I only care about the clearance meeting in the context of how it made Oppenheimer feel.",2023-07-25 01:47:08

It'd be like when Marvel/Disney touts that they spend a bajillion dollars on some movie's CG, what's it matter when the actual CG still looks underwhelming?   


Like I get that it's very, very hard to market what's essentially a biopic but I think it's more than fair for someone to give their comments especially if they spent anywhere from 10$ to even 40$ to see the film.",2023-07-25 09:11:37

"My friend group mostly gave this a 9 as well and I was in genuine disbelief. I feel like they got hyped up by the Einstein scene at the end of the movie and chose to overlook the basically 1 hour right before then that shouldn’t have been there.

"I did like the observation by a couple of characters, notably his wife, that letting himself be put through the wringer for his security clearance was him punishing himself for developing the bomb. That to some degree justified the huge amount of the movie devoted to those scenes. But they were too long, as you point out too repetitive, and in a movie told in nonlinear fashion, there was no reason to make them the entire third act of the movie. It's anticlimactic coming after the apocalyptic drama of the bomb itself, especially with that much time devoted to it. It basically destroyed the pacing of the film. I think there's a bit of Stephen King syndrome going on. Nolan needed somebody to tell him to trim some of the fat off, but in his position in the industry there probably aren't a lot of people to do that.",2023-08-22 11:54:27

I can't agree with that because it seems like he acted like this in real life. Was *all in*, then suddenly realized. It's not Nolan poor writing, it's Oppie poor thinking.",2023-08-20 20:11:43

"As a big Nolan fan I completely agree. The movie is borderline impossible to understand due to the pace. It's everything I dislike about Tenet but in a slightly less confusing movie.

Someone said it better yesterday, but the movie is boring. Not because it isn't interesting, but because it has a single pace the entire way through. There is pretty much never a point things slow down, so even when the trinity test happens it doesn't feel particularly special.",2023-07-22 21:12:31
"I warned myself to stop falling for hype. This time I let myself buy into the hype, it seemed too real. Boy was I disappointed.

Just like Dunkirk. About 100 British soldiers on the beach and two fighter planes fighting it out. Absolutely ridiculous sense of scale vs reality.

And in Oppenheimer, we never actually got a sense of how destructive the physics are. Instead of showing the audience the devastation that was created we get a courtroom drama.",2023-07-22 22:07:28

I understand that Strauss' scheme influenced US nuclear policy. But HOW? Why don't spend time on this instead of dwelving into the technicalities through these courtroom scenes? Who cares if Oppie was a communist or not, these are miniscule issues compared to the implications on international security landscape.

There is not much context or motivation given. It is an interesting subject, to explore the morality of person who was responsible for most devastating bomb in human history but we don't get that much in 3 hrs of runtime.

A 30 min video by Veritesium gave enough context on Oppenheimer than movie tbh.

It has a similar structure as The Social network and movie would have been more accessible if they hired a better screenwriter.

I think this was one of the truly brilliant performances of our time, that *has* to be seen on a large screen. As is usually the case with Murphy (but amplified by such a knowing director-partner in Nolan), he does **so** much with his eyes and subtle facial expressions. 

I think all of that is lost on a 42"" screen. And maximized, of course, on the biggest screen.",2023-07-23 14:35:16
I felt the same way. Maybe it’s my own fault because I created a narrative in my head where the climax of the movie would be Hiroshima. And then it happened off screen,2023-07-23 20:39:47
I agree. Nolan's refusal (alleged) to use CGI weakens the films. There are some distracting modern buildings in the background of Dunkirk and the same happens in Oppenheimer (scenes at Princeton).

"I’m actually glad that i didn’t looked up to much information before watching the movie. Made some scenes very intense. Nolan also mentioned in multiple interviews that people that don’t know much about the story get the most out of the movie

I never felt like Strauss or any of these people had loyalty to him to begin with. Without understanding the bigger context and the nuances of the relationships/political situation, it was hard for me to understand the point.

I saw it yesterday evening and I felt the female character in this film were incredibly bland, stereotyped and frankly ridiculous. I don't feel Nolan is the best with writing female character but Elliot Page in Inception for example was much much better. Even the sex scene and the nudes, it felt very forced, not in line with the rest of the movie.
The dialogue in general, with that ""clever and fast"" tone, I felt was very unrealistic but kind of justified by the incredible amount of information he had to put in these 3 hour movie.",2023-08-26 11:07:34

Also I like when I can understand movies for the first time. It's not as bad as Tenet but still the stupid cutting back and forth between timelines is sometimes jarring. Even though I understood the story I feel like Nolan is just trying to be clever for the sake of being clever.

Acting was phenomenal, the visuals spectacular (Hoytema killing it as always), and the story really interesting and exciting, except perhaps the Strauss parts.

The Tolmans, the Oppenheimers, and Lawrence were all friends. Oppie having an affair with Ruth did have a negative impact on his friendship with Lawrence, although post-war the primary disagreement the two had was over H-bomb development (Lawrence was allied with Teller).",2023-07-24 02:57:10

As a viewer already familiar with the history, I guess it felt 'correct,' because I was already expecting and anticipating it. Plus there were threads throughout the film emphasizing the mystery of who leaked Oppenheimer's security files to Borden. Meaning the twist did have setup.

I think Nolan wanted to the film to be about Oppenheimer and not the bomb. Showing Japanese ruins would've really overshadowed all of that.,2023-08-01 17:18:00
"I appreciate the thoughtful analysis. As a scientific history buff, I too was disappointed at how little science was covered and discussed in the film. The main innovators of the nuclear chain reaction (Fermi and Szilard), as well as other key scientific innovators were barely mentioned at all. I’m not familiar with the source material, but I’m assuming the focus on Oppenheimer’s associations with the Communist Party and the Strauss hearings were a key part, it just doesn’t interest me that much.

I do have to disagree with you on how the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were handled though. We (the audience) were just as “out of the loop,” and removed from the events as Oppenheimer, and it really made me feel…detached, like I was being neglected (again, like Oppenheimer was). Also, I feel like having an intense bombing scene, especially after the Trinity test scene would’ve felt out of place.",2023-08-02 04:55:40
">The fact they did not choose to show the bombs being dropped on Nagasaki or Hiroshima or the fallout missed the mark for me. 

This was my largest takeaway as well; The movie walks the viewer all the way up to the line of acknowledging the Atrocities of Nuclear Weapons without allowing the viewer to Reflect on these acts (Show, don't Tell). I realize that this was probably a fervent ongoing discussion throughout filming on whether or not it would be tactful to show the atrocities, either with Historical Record or through Recreation. I'm not sure I have the right answer, but like, This is the subject matter of the film; I didn't sign up to watch a 3-hour film lamenting the construction of the nuclear bomb for the to white-wash the actual victims during his Lucid Dream Sequence while giving the Bleacher Speech.

I respect Nolan's Practical Approach, and perhaps restraint for not recreating or Filming the attacks on Nagasaki or Hiroshima, Instead using artistic license to show the effects of Radiation in his Lucid Bleacher Speech, however, I his visions are tame in comparison to what could've been shown and IMO doesn't leave the viewer as horrorstruck as the Characters of the movie. I'm not asking for CGI Recreations of Barefoot Gem that would be NSFL or make the film NC-17 or anything, but what's the point of an R rating on such a dark divisive topic if you're only going to be giving a half-measure.

\--

I Understand that the Strauss Confirmation Hearing was the framing device for the movie, but it hardly seemed related to the plot. RDJ's performance was great, probably the most acting he's been able to do in 20 years, But I can't help but wonder how necessary this was for the overall plot since the majority of the film was shown from Oppenheimer's perspective; The movie felt like it was 30 minutes too long anyway, and Unfortunately for RDJ, I know exactly which 30 minutes to cut.",2023-08-01 16:52:56

I'm also afraid to know what you think of actually intimate character studies like *Whiplash* and *Taxi Driver*. The only intimate thing about *Oppenheimer* is the way the ear-r\*pe sound track intimately violates your ear-drums while you're trying to watch it.

Every line of dialogue in this movie was idiotic and cheesy, the music was barely discernable as music, half the film was paced like a trailer, and it didn't even do a decent job of exploring its themes. I'm not making these criticisms up, they're extremely obvious and apparent to anyone who doesn't have Nolan's cock rammed down their throat.

I watched *Margin Call* last night, a movie that deals with the topic of an economic collapse. It's a movie with compelling characters, memorable dialogue, and deep-themes.

To add further, I also really hate how Nolan cannot write or direct a female character worth shit when there's two incredibly important ones in here that are essentially reduced to plot devices. I also could not stand that absolutely nothing has room to breathe. It's a character study that's told solely through exposition to the extent that there's ~3 minutes of film where there's *not* dialogue going or music (and both are always going together) and it's exhausting. He allows no space for the viewer to just be lost in the characters or setting or events and it's just fact after fact after fact after fact of event after event after event in the worst possible way like a shit tier high school history teacher that makes the whole class hate studying history.

"I think the movie was overhyped but I still think it's a good movie.

I don't agree with most of what you said.

1) ofc the true events are oversimplified and dramatized. It's a movie

2) the focus of the story is Oppenheimer as a person and the implications of his contribution to a weapon of mass destruction. It's about the social and political impact of his work and the role scientists in the US before and after the war. 

3) it's not really about the Manhatten project alone or the technical aspects of the bomb. The majority of ppl won't understand the physics and if Nolan would have portrayed all of it accurately and in detail, it would make for an incredibly boring movie (not too different to Interstellar, is it?). Him including other notable scientists involved, simply highlights the fact that Oppenheimer despite his ego and some popular belief (father of the atomic bomb) was obviously just one of many ppl who contributed. The movie also focuses more on his personal relationships and the diverging opinions. 

4) I concede that I also found the sex scene misplaced. I think they should've put the quote at the beginning or the end of the movie. Although the sex scene alone (without the Sanskrit quote) makes more sense later in the movie during his hearing. 

5) not sure what your issue is with the dialogue. the way they did the explosion was also interesting and surprising in my opinion.",2023-07-25 00:27:26

I thought this movie is gonna take more the scientific-philosophical-spiritual route into oppenheimer and humanity as a whole like a lot of Nolan's movies which leave you with existencial crisis, but i cant take it seriously when a movie about world war and invention of the nuclear bomb gets rated R not for the bomb or war, but for a completely uneccessary intimate scene on it",2023-07-21 15:43:58

"Damn this will get downvoted. I see your points. I myselfe however knew nothing about oppenheimer and the Manhattan project and i dont think many did.

Coming from this standpoint there was a lot of info to take in and much more would not have fit in to the movie. Nolan also obviously had to put a focus on something because its still just a movie and he chose the political side of things and the treatment of oppenheimer after the project was finished. Hence the buildup of oppenheimers ties to communism and the concequences it had later. In regards to your point on physics and the different famous physicists. Going into more detail on the physics and social side of the project would be to much for us layman and filming people doing experiments and math aint that enteraining. And in regards to al the famous side charracters scientists. They all have their own story that could take up their own movie. But this movie was about oppenheimer and not about the manhatten project and everyone involved.

So i have the feeling you wanted a full documentary of the project with all the details but thats not what a movie is for. There is a perfectly good book that will fullfill those needs. It looks like most people where entertained and the movie cept quite close to the facts so everyone is happy and the movie fullfilled its job. You dont watch movies to be educated.

"Anyone who feels this way, I strongly recommend reading the book ""American Promotheus"". But here's a quick summary:

-B&W is Strauss (RDJ) perspective. Most of the B&W is a government hearing for the nomination of Strauss to a presidential cabinet position. During that hearing, senators are free to ask Strauss questions and invite other persons to ask questions about Strauss' competence. During that hearing, one of the people brought on by the senate (Rami Malek) exposed Strauss as an opportunist and architect of destroying Oppenheimers credibility. We also see how the two aides assigned to Strauss slowly discover this truth. 

- The interrogation in the small room with Oppenheimer was a private meeting with the AEC (science organization that recommends stuff to the government) about whether or not Oppenheimer should get a security clearance renewed. This happens after the bomb was tested and dropped in Japan, but before the Strauss hearings in B&W. In reality this hearing was just a kangaroo court to get oppenheimers dirty secrets out to a written transcript record. He was never going to get his clearance renewed.

-Everything else in the movie pretty much happened prior to the AEC meeting as flashbacks and callbacks, etc. I don't blame you for getting lost, my gf also got thrown up. 

P.S. the only B&W scene that wasn't in the cabinet hearing was the Einstein one (that was just the first time Strauss and Oppy met) and the round table dinner discussion about H-Bomb (this happened almost right after WW2 when scientist discovered Russia also had their bomb and what the US needs to do to counter it)",2023-07-24 17:44:04
"I feel exactly the same. After the first 30 minutes I had no idea what was going on and why I was supposed to care about any character, so I just checked out for the rest of the movie.

"I really liked it because I felt Rami was going to speak in Strauss' favour as the 1 time we see him before he was unceremoniously shoved aside by Oppenheimer and Strauss himself mentioned that the scientists never forgave him for not signing the petition.

But then the twist comes in with Rami crucifying Strauss instead showing the unity in the scientific community and Strauss getting his comeuppance.",2023-07-24 19:04:46

They really didn't give the gut punch that was needed I left the theater in a daze. Imo they should have actually gone into some detail of the horrible conditions on the ground at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They show the scientists reactions but don't show the viewers what they saw. They could have at least included a quote from hibakusha. There's one in there that tears me apart about a mother needing to leave her daughter behind as the fires got close.

"Lewis Strauss was an admiral, businessman, and politician who became an AEC commissioner, and later its chairman. He was a hardline conservative Republican who was extremely distrustful of the Soviets, liberals, and basically anyone who didn't share his views.

As a trustee at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at Princeton, Strauss actually recruited Oppenheimer after WWII to run the IAS. But unlike his fellow conservative Gen. Leslie Groves, who had a strong working relationship w/ Oppenheimer at Los Alamos, Strauss soon came to be annoyed by Oppenheimer's personality and way of doing things.

Anyway, Strauss eventually despised Oppenheimer for his public opposition to the hydrogen bomb as well as his advocacy for an international coalition for nuclear arms control, as those positions were in direct conflict with American military interests, if not outright traitorous (to him). As such, Strauss conspired with J. Edgar Hoover to start digging up dirt on Oppie, and although his early Communist associations were long old news by the 1950s (they were certainly known before being appointed to head Los Alamos and then his later appointment to the AEC), Strauss decided to relitigate them by ambushing Oppenheimer with a closed door AEC hearing to revoke his security clearance. And he succeeded, forcing Oppenheimer into virtual exile. 

However, Strauss's conduct during this entire affair was not forgotten by either the (many, many) scientists who worked with Oppenheimer or by Senate Democrats. When Eisenhower nominated Strauss for Commerce Secretary, there was considerable opposition mobilized to derail the confirmation. And the opposition succeeded, ending Strauss's political career.",2023-07-21 20:00:35

Inception... I mean the connection between Leo and his wife. The relationship between the ""incepted"" Cillian Murphy and his disapproving father... 

I got chills when Alfred finally sees Bruce in Europe at the end of The Dark Knight Rises after assuming he died...full circle moment right there...Bruce finally getting the life he wants. Took the trilogy for him to believe he even deserved to put his happiness first. 

I don't think Nolan gets enough credit.  Also, I loved how he portrayed Oppy's relationship with his wife and how he told his pal that anyone who makes assumptions about someone else's relationships are either fools or children.

The second conversation was after the war, in 1947 I believe. 

Oppenheimer started teaching at Berkeley well before the war, Strauss was not involved at that point.

The whole thing about Kennedy was purely for the audience.

"I literally only saw it last night too and I’m already losing my grasp on the timelines so apologies if I have this wrong but I did think the same. That first scene with Einstein takes place between 1945 and the hearing for the renewal of his security clearance. The problem is that from that scene onwards the film takes a fairly clear line of three timelines - Los Almos during the war, the hearing post-war and the Senate hearing in the 50s(?)

For the most part those three timelines are easy to tell apart - the two ones in colour are clear enough as Oppenheimer looks older in the post-war ones and the senate ones are black and white but peppered in then are the first Einstein meeting, the AEC meeting at the birthday etc

And the point? ""Nuclear weapons could blow up the world"". OMG. Shattering news.

Nolan cannot write a script for shit. He needs to be told to stop trying.

I think it's to show, as Einstein said, they just used him.

It’s a flawed account bc it’s the account of a flawed man.

"that was my big takeaway:  Strauss is not a scientist, he's basically just a booster/hanger-on, who gets butthurt people don't revere him.

If they had just cut his storyline out, and explained ""Oh, you pissed off the wrong people and now your security clearance is up for review"", you could've lost the entire RDJ timeline/story/appearance.

but i guess we're supposed to get some ""happy ending/win"" feelings from Strauss getting denied.  and it does give you a villain to hate.  and definitely makes it a different story/movie than Fat Man & Little Boy (or, more recently, the Imitation Game, where a war hero gets tarnished later for past sins)

i  don't deny RDJ's performance was good.  But his whole character's presence (in the story) seemed out of step with the first 2/3rds of the film, where every character is either a scientist or a soldier, and ever convo is about science or the war.

if this had been a fictional story, we might've followed Oppenheimer AFTER the war - maybe he goes and talks with Heisenberg in the post-war investigations.  maybe he meets Werner Von Braun or other ex-nazis who are helping with ICBM development.   He gets disillusioned at Operation Paperclip and THAT's why the eUS Govt turns on him (or some such)

His films just snap into focus in a way that might seem overly clinical, but just think of the emotional highs and chills in moments from the Dark Knight trilogy, Prestige, Inception, goddamn video message scene from Interstellar.

I'm ashamed to say I have a shockingly short attention span (I regularly end up ""second screening"" whilst watching films at home). However, Oppenheimer held me from start to finish.

>!In fact, after the success of the bomb, I was starting to worry about how the appeals process could maintain the pace of the film for the remainder of the runtime (I had no idea how much time had passed, but knew that the success of the bomb wasn't going to be the end of the story).!<

>!However, I think that the political intrigue that followed not only justified the additional runtime, but was necessary to telling the story of how the bomb went from theory to practice to politics.!<

>!I do not think the film would've been complete without a resolution to the broader political context. I feel that this elevates the B/W scenes with Senator Lewis Strauss from a simple framing device, to an essential part of the whole story of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer -as told by Christopher Nolan!<

>!Incidentally, I saw this film with my dad (who is an old hand at the political game -and is well aware of the dark arts entailed), and he said that it was one of the best political films he has seen in his life.!<

Further than that, his objection to the hydrogen bomb was clear just one of the reasons why he was in the kangaroo court. He's right at least in the film when he objected to us hiding what we were doing from our allies would create the very thing they were trying to avoid. He talks about Russia's power and might. And then I think someone brought up the quote there are two types of communism and I think they're referring to you know the kind that runs people over with tanks and the kind where we share in our endeavors we share with our resources, and we share amongst ourselves the human rights of people, as opposed to an arms race.

"> the trinity test was beautifully presented but Nolan absolutely fails to scale to the audience how big the explosion was. You know its far from how it was presented but you don't feel it was far. Like seeing on a map how far 3 hour drive is vs actually driving for 3 hours.  

I don't understand this complaint, and it *infuriates* me. 
[This is the Trinity explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TrinityFireballGif.gif). The movie literally modeled the scene off this and other footage, as practically as they could.  

It's like everyone expects to see the Bikini Atoll explosions, or fucking *Tsar Bomba* or something. Trinity was 25x bigger than the non-nuclear explosion that occurred in Beirut, and was actually 10kt bigger than the explosion that destroyed Hiroshima. They are *miniscule,* compared to the Castle Bravo and Tsar Bomba explosions.  

I get that people don't generally understand explosions past what Hollywood has shown, but god*damn* am I tired of reading this shit in this thread. The intent wasn't to show you BiG BooM WOw.

"> this is the wokest movie I seen in recent memory

I mean, not really. When people use ""woke"" (derogatorily or not at this point, since there's no better name for it) usually they refer to the specific trends and language developed mainly by the online left in the last 10-15 years or so, which is a specific and peculiar style of politics (which some who have only experienced it may not realize). The movie felt like it certainly was critic of the US (but not completely damning) and open to considering that communists weren't all evil anti-US conspirators (which anyone with some common sense would know, though the risk of USSR infiltration was also real). Overall, I'd say it's leaning liberal, but it's very much making its criticism in a more classical, old-fashioned way, mostly letting the viewers make their judgement about the various issues on display.

I'd say Truman's portrayal was unflattering, but then again, as the man who *ordered* the bomb dropped, I can see how he would consider Oppenheimer a crybaby for going all ""I have blood on my hands"". He'd be like ""yeah man sucks huh, guess what kind of decisions I have to take every fucking day in this job"".",2023-07-22 06:14:34

"I think most people expected something more action packed (its the atomic bomb after all) instead of a personal drama about a scientist. Many also dont really know even a fraction of the scientists who appeared here which IMO also removes a layer from the film. As someone who studied physics (but then went into maths), I loved it and hope for more films like this - kind of like an antithesis to the films we get about pop culture personalities like Elvis or Bohemian Rhapsody.

But I agree about the first 20mins. The structure of the movie was kind of hard to get into at first. And I dislike the ""visions"" about the atom / radiation when he was a student.

Edit: Thinking about it and especially about the ending: While I didnt want them to take more time for Strauss since the movie is already long, it also felt that it needed more.

Literally, the ending of Interstellar is one of the dumbest things I've seen, I could not believe it while I was watching it. Then I was bored out of my mind with Dunkirk. And Tenet was so confusing on purpose, it was baffling Warner Bros gave him any money to do it. I think Oppie is better than his last two, at least, but it's still nowhere near in comparison the front half of his filmography up to Inception.",2023-07-22 17:05:58

"Explosion being overhyped was the biggest problem for this movie’s marketing. They almost advertise it like we’re going to see WW2 play out between scenes in the trailer. I’m just glad I made myself temper expectations and knew it was a biopic not a war movie or something.

Ultimately the bomb drop is underwhelming because we’ve all seen real nuclear explosions at this point, so it doesn’t look that impressive. Knowing it was real was cool but it felt like “ah yep that is a real bomb I guess!”

The sound design was incredible though!",2023-07-21 13:58:59

"The first half is actually quite intense. Some really powerful setpieces.

"I did a Barbeinheimer double bill today, and went into the latter without having seen a trailer, last Nolan movie I saw was Inception about eight (?) years ago. 

Short answer: yes, it’s worth the price of admission. You have to concentrate because Nolan loves a time skip and sometimes the characters are a bit hard to hear bc the sound mixing is sometimes slightly off, but it’s visually stunning and I thought the trinity bomb test scene was very good. Even though it was three hours long, I never felt like it dragged. If you like a character driven political drama (and I do), this is the film for you. Cillian Murphy’s performance is absolutely phenomenal, and it’s definitely thought-provoking. 

That said, for what it’s worth, while it was good and I enjoyed it but I probably won’t watch it again whereas I loved Barbie and will definitely watch that again - but they’re very different so it depends what you’re in to. I was watching Oppenheimer admiring Nolan’s technical proficiency, whereas Barbie is more straight-up entertaining, if that makes sense.",2023-07-26 21:09:20

"I am far from a Nolan fan. I like his films but I wouldn't say any of them are my favorite. I thought this film was just OK. The acting was great, and it's a nice looking film, but honestly it felt like I was watching a three hour long film of straight dialogue telling me about what Oppenheimer did instead of showing what he did. I also was expecting a movie more about the science of the atom bomb and the running of the Manhatten project, and instead these elements were glossed over in favor of focusing on Oppenheimer's ties to communism. 

The atom bomb explosion was pretty underwhelming too. 

Overall it was a 7/10 for me.

Edit: I want to add that I went into this with a basic understanding of the events of the movie already, so it's not like I was completely lost as to what was going on or didn't understand it. I just wasn't really a fan of how it was all presented.",2023-07-26 18:22:13
I honestly thought it was bad.  Endless dramatic music over every scene.  I’m told how I’m supposed to feel rather than actually feeling it and the background story is way more interesting than the story we were given. Convoluted flashbacks and flash forwards and the conflicts in the story seemed kind of “who cares…”?,2023-07-26 20:06:14
"Watched it today, i loved watching Interstellar, loved Dunkirk and same goes for The Dark Knight, not a big rewatcher so most of these ive only seen once or twice. 

The movie is good, its worth seeing, but personally for me it failed to live up to the hype, it was a tad bit confusing with the out of chronological order things, i thought it focused too little on the science (im not expecting a science flick but just a bit more explanation of some of the bomb stuff) 

I doubt i will watch it again, as it is my opinion that this and Interstellar are movies that requires a big screen and a phenomal sound system to watch, neither of which i have, or plan on acquiring anytime soon. 

Is it worth the admission ticket? Yes, most definitely, you will not be disappointed, but for me personally it fell short of the hype.",2023-07-26 22:51:45
"I’m 100% out of the loop as far as Hollywood goes. I had heard the name, but I didn’t even know about Christopher Nolan, his reputation, or what movies he made before this.

Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anybody who holds even the slightest interest in the subject.

Edit: I do think you get out what you put in, to a degree. Comprehend the gravity of the subject and you will end up very moved. An uninterested, uneducated teenager might not see what all the fuss is about. Those who were bored probably did not know much, if anything, about the events the movie covers, and do not truly appreciate the consequences of them. It is not an action movie, but I was enthralled the whole way through. The Trinity test was anything *but* underwhelming, as a few contrarians are saying. 

People will always find something to complain about; you’d think the kind to complain about that scene would have wanted the atmosphere to go up in flames, then for Oppenheimer to crawl out from underneath the rubble, screaming “NOW I AM BECOME DEATH, MOTHERFUCKER!!!” before donning his hat and winking at the camera while melting into a slurry of blood and charred goo. The shockwave blows what’s left of his bones through Jean’s casket, together again at last. Pan all the way to Japan, where Emperor Hirohito sees the world slowly consumed by fire and ugly-cries on his knees while staring up at a disappearing and smoke filled sky until he, too, gorily becomes one with the great mushroom cloud which is now all Earth.

Like CSI or Law & Order or something) and a lot of parts felt like I was watching a movie trailer instead of an actual movie.

I think for the character of Oppenheimer, Nolan probably saw that one famous interview and decided “yeah that’s how he probably talked all the time.” I also don’t like the way they incorporated his most famous quote.

Killers of the Flower Moon on the other hand is quite worse in several ways, most notably that Osage women were being brutally murdered for control of their oil.",2023-07-22 13:36:50
This wasn’t a slow burn at all!! It had an extremely fast paced that very rarely relented. Just because there isn’t action and just people talking doesn’t mean it’s a slow burn. This film was edited like the beginning part of a roller coaster. It was all ascension. Constantly building and building until the final shot. Lincoln is a far slower film. Both work for what they’re trying to accomplish in my opinion. I agree about your point with the non-linear storytelling. I’m always a sucker for that.

"Oppenheimer isn't considering that he accidentally lit the atmosphere. He's saying he sealed humanity's fate and that nuclear war is inevitable. That's why it ends with shots of missiles being launched and world bein engulfed in fire. As far as the chronology, oppenheimer met strauss after the manhattan project and before the AEC. That scene is their first meeting and his first insane assumption oppenheimer is turning scientists against him.",2023-08-19 05:27:16
"If you go to Wikipedia and read the plot summary on there, it is in chronological order. It helped me a lot to read that after I watched it.",2023-08-19 04:26:41
"As someone already suggested, it helps to read the plot from Wikipedia. I also recommend rewatching it after digesting the plot and figuring out the names. 

To briefly answer some of your questions, Strauss met Oppenheimer in 1947 at Princeton, where he offered him the position of director of the Institute of Advanced Study. This is the early scene in the movie where Strauss shows Oppenheimer around his new office, and then they meet Einstein. At this time, the bomb had of course already been developed and used. In 1949, during a hearing by the AEC which debated the export of radioactive isotopes, Oppenheimer appeared to embarrass Strauss, which marked the beginning of Strauss’ animosity towards Oppenheimer. In addition, the pair held differing views on the development of the Hydrogen bomb first conceived by Teller and referred to colloquially as the “Super”, with Strauss fervently supporting the acceleration of the program and Oppenheimer seeing it as waste of resources.  Strauss was also insecure about Oppenheimer’s growing influence in the scientific sphere, and feared that he was poisoning the community against him. This dates back to their 
first meeting in 1947 where he assumes that Oppenheimer and Einstein were discussing him, when in reality they weren’t, as seen in the final scene of the movie. As for the meeting at the table, that took place sometime in 1949 when it was revealed that the Soviet Union was pilot testing some plutonium-fueled explosive devices, similar in nature to those manufactured at Los Alamos. This insinuated that there was a spy at Los Alamos during the development of the bomb, which indeed turned out to be true; Klaus Fuchs, a German theoretical physicist who had spent sometime in Britain, was supplying the Soviet Union with information about the development of the bomb. All these factors, along with Oppenheimer’s close ties with known communists led Strauss to orchestrate an unfair hearing on Oppenheimer’s security clearance. He gave William Borden, the executive director of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, access to Oppenheimer’s security files and convinced him to write an open letter to Edgar Hoover of the FBI accusing Oppenheimer of being an agent of the Soviet Union. So thus, in 1954,  Oppenheimer lost his security clearance. And finally, in 1959, Strauss’ recess nomination as secretary of commerce was rejected by the senate due to his personal vendetta against Oppenheimer that was brought to light by the testimony of David Hill.",2023-08-20 16:06:06
"This is not a movie that demands to be seen in theaters, let alone in 70mm IMAX. Sure, the experience will be heightened in the theater, as it would for any other movie: The picture/sound is bigger/better ... but this is mostly a drama with a lot of dialogue and close-ups of peoples' faces ... There are very few ""breathtaking"" wide shots, and the actual visual of the atomic explosion, I'd say, is a little underwhelming. I can much more appreciate the need to see practically any other Nolan film in IMAX, but honestly, this ain't it!",2023-08-28 16:03:08
"I'm a be real, this movie's probably the *best* and *worst* example of Hollywood ""**must see in theaters""** type movies.  


If you do see it in theaters, a great *experience* imo, but not a very great film outside of it. If you're a buff for sound design this movie's really probably some of his best work, if not some of the best work of sound design in recent memory, probably just around Dune but both are definitely below Top Gun Maverick in making you feel that *oomph* of the action.  


But my problem with Oppenheimer is that I just don't think it'd age well at all outside of theaters. Unless you have some good speakers at home with a decent TV it'd probably just feel like a 3 hour biopic with an admittedly very *eh* explosive payoff even when watching it in IMAX. Just like other ""see it in IMAX"" movies, this might actually be the worst case of needing to see it in theaters for it to really be worthwhile. While movies like Maverick definitely have that extra adrenaline rush in theaters, it's still very entertaining at home. Dune, to some extent, has the same issue as Oppenheimer but I think I've consistently liked Denis' work more than Nolan's after watching some of their older movies.",2023-08-28 17:32:37

I actually think that the switch between different aspect ratios helps. The dialog scenes inside rooms have a different ratio which you notice, and that punch comes from the change. It's not just having a particular ratio, it's the movement between them I noticed. ANd it's not two, I think there are 3 or even 4.

Buttttt I also am of the opinion that you do what works for you and it's not like you can't enjoy a movie without the perfectly-sized screen. My mother is 74 with tinnitus and we didn't have issues with sound, FWIW",2023-08-29 23:36:22

> those pulsing, whirring visual cutaways were awesome. Why did they just stop?

You're right. The moment these stopped is the moment the wind just died for this movie. It blows my mind that they didn't apply this to actually seeing the bomb going off.

> Oppenheimer was a weird, fascinating dude....

Reading this, and about all these other stories and personalities, makes me so sad that we spent all this time with RDJ.

> The very end of the movie is this fiery vision of doomsday...

And Kubrick did that ending already, much better, just by using the real footage.

Why did the critics like this movie so much?",2023-07-22 19:28:25
"Probably the best review I've read here. Kudos. 

Extras point for knowing the context of that Destroyer of Worlds quote. Nolan only cared about the literal meaning and how it would fit in the aesthetic of things. The fact that the context itself would have been ammo enough for him to go ahead and want to build the thing.. Only realizing later that he's no Krishna. He's no God. He's just mortal. He's Prometheus. Only Gods can give you the power to destroy, you cannot take it from them and give it to mankind. 

Imagine that. Krishna and Prometheus decoded and finally understood by Oppenheimer in the aftermath of his actions. He tried to play god but realized he's only human in the end. Imagine the epic visuals that could have been provided to us on film as recurring nightmares after Hiroshima-Nagasaki. 

Also, even if your argument is that this is all Oppenheimer's POV and hence we don't see the victims.. It was perfectly possible he meets one later on in life. Much much later. This is a biography yes but i dont think anybody would have minded a first person account of a victim. Replace the many Strauss scenes with just one of this. 


Also a major MAJOR issue is how Oppenheimer just just falsifies details of alamos being the perfect place with nobody around. COMPLETE ERASURE OF HISTORY THERE. Unforgivable in my opinion. US Gov bulldozed their homes, cattle and forced them to move within a day. Then they made the workers work without protective gear. Where was all this? Not even in passing do we get any of this. All brushed aside. 

I've had two days to process the movie and the more I get to know about the historical inaccuracies and the blatant erasure of things.. I find it even harder to praise it.",2023-07-22 18:29:31

"This criticism felt quite aggressive, but I agree with almost every point to a certain degree. That's the weird thing, I still very much liked the movie - but every film nowadays sort of feel like appreciating the potential.

Why is it either a braindead effects-fest or a melodrama with shot-reverse-shot and close ups of faces? Where are the true epics? We have the tech down, why aren't they made?

"> The movie is so long and it exposits so aggressively, why is the science is reduced to pure mysticism. Christopher Nolan seems obsessed with realism so I don't get why these genius men and women are relegated to speaking in platitudes about the science they devoted their lives to study.

The science was reduced quite a bit to become *more* understandable, but it is essentially mysticism to the vast majority of people.

Think of all the people involved in some way: Einstein, Heisenberg, and Born laid foundations; Bethe, Bohr, Fermi, Feynman, Chadwick, Szilard, Lawrence, von Neumann, Teller, etc.

Anything beyond platitudes will lose the audience - as it's still pretty advanced physics some 80 years later. There comes a point where adding more explanation doesn't help, so it kept the science accurate, but to the point.",2023-07-22 21:41:13
"This is an excellent review. But to pile on one more could-have-been, the way the discovery of fission spread through the scientific community was a lot more cinematic than depicted in the film—a lost opportunity.

Fermi was splitting atoms in Italy as early as 1934, though he did not know that's what was happening in his experiments. He interpreted his results of neuron bombardment as producing new elements, heavier than uranium. The Joliet-Curies in France and the Meitner-Hahn team in Germany kept finding irregularities in Fermi's interpretation because it was wrong. Ida Noddack, a theorist, hinted at the correct interpretation, but she was ignored. By 1938, the Meitner-Hahn team was at the brink of discovery but Lise Meitner had to flee Germany because Germany had annexed Austria, and so her Austrian citizenship no longer protected her from anti-Jewish laws. She left with nothing but a small bag and a valuable ring.

While in exile in Sweden, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch were taking a walk when they realized that the nuclei in everyone's experiments were being split into smaller (known) nuclei, releasing a lot of energy in the process. Meitner stopped in the snow to calculate the amount of energy, and they both recognized the significance.

Frish managed to catch Nils Bohr on the docks as he was getting on a boat for America. Many scientists were fleeing Europe that year, because it was obvious that World War 2 was starting. (Fermi used his 1938 Nobel prize trip to Stockholm to secretly get his whole family out of Italy. The prize was for his mistaken discovery of new elements.)

On the docks, Frish explained it to Bohr, who also recognized its significance. He promised to keep it secret while Meitner and Frish finished writing their paper. Bohr brooded about it for a month at sea. In New York, he told a few physicists at Columbia, which set off a chain reaction of its own, with physicists telling their colleagues at other east coast universities. The request to wait for Meitner and Frish's paper was lost along the way. On the first day of a conference on superconductivity in Washington, D.C. (a totally different field), someone burst into the room, explained how nuclei were being split, and everyone left the conference to reproduce the discovery at their home universities. That's what spread the news across the country.

Meanwhile, Leo Szilard had been thinking about sustained nuclear chain reactions since 1933; he just didn't know what reaction could be made to trigger itself. When he heard about the atom being split, releasing neutrons that could initiate more reactions, he realized that this was the one that could be turned into a bomb. He immediately tried to get his colleagues to adopt a code of secrecy, which was a hard sell, but he eventually won them over. He's also the one who tracked down Einstein (on vacation in upstate New York) to have him write a letter to the president, starting the Manhattan project. (Einstein was the only scientist famous enough for Roosevelt to know personally.)

Unlike the movie, the Berkeley scientists wouldn't have learned about it from the newspaper—this wildfire discovery was spreading much more quickly through the scientific community, as well as its import. (Atomic energy was a common theme in science fiction at the time—though usually as a fuel for rockets to the moon—it would have been in everybody's mind.) And its discovery was also deeply connected to the mass exodus of scientists from Europe and the beginning of war. There's a lot of dramatic potential here, which the movie didn't take advantage of.

"I was quite happy with them not showing the bombings because the movie was heavily centered around Oppenheimer himself and I feel like showing more special effects of a bombing would've been a distraction. The moment it happened worked well to me because it was heard over the radio just when he wasn't sure what was happening. The focus is on his state of mind and his reaction to finding out the news. Even the Trinity test spent a decent amount of time focusing on people's reaction rather than a copious amount of time on some mushroom cloud. The loud boom was delayed extra long to emphasize the drama to let people take in the silence. 

While I agree the sex scene seemed unnecessary, his nudity in the closed-room hearing seemed apt. Would've been rated R for language regardless. 

My main gripes are more about Nolan's style being a bit overdone at times. Choosing the blast the soundtrack over some dialogue to invoke emotion rather than allowing the actors to do it at times was distracting. Probably works in theater sound but will be difficult to parse through on regular home audio without subtitles.

His techniques to tell a few stories in parallel but at different elapsed times is a bit old to me. Inception and Dunkirk followed the same formula and it works for those movies but felt unnecessary for Oppenheimer other than to make it feel more like a Nolan flick.",2023-07-24 22:51:27

There's only so much you can include in a movie, and that's just the stuff that was part of his life.

Louis Slotin isn't part of Oppenheimer's story. Einstein's socialism isn't part of his story. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are barely part of his story because by that point (as pointed out in the movie) the key strategic decisions lay with the military.

The quotation from the Bhagavad Gita isn't even attested to contemporaneously — a real quotation from Kenneth Bainbridge, ""now we're all sons of bitches"" is actually a banger. Oppenheimer referred to the ""destroyer of worlds"" line in letters several years later and in the 1965 TV documentary in order to burnish his reputation, which actually dovetails with the themes in this new movie.

Strauss, whose primary motivations are petty personal vendettas over perceived sleights, believes that this will help him and result in Hill giving positive testimony since he presumably would dislike Oppenheimer.

But that was also an indication that Hill had a strong moral compass and principled view of the world and the way that government should be run. Someone like Strauss who would go out of his way to destroy a scientist like Oppenheimer when he spoke out in favor of those more principled views later on would absolutely be someone that Hill would be personally against seeing in power on ethical grounds.",2023-07-22 13:28:52

Strauss meant to befriend all the physicists after the war and chase the big spots in government with their support. And yea well it didnt turn out that way and then he took actions to fight oppie and his influence in nuclear energy debates. In order to do so he pulled some strings and made Oppie face those trials calling him a traitor and a commie. We see both trials taking place in 1954 when we see ultimately strauss's demise. Whilst facing the demise Strauss is referencing quite a few times that oppie managed to turn the scientists against him beginning with Einstein. Then he references that lake scene set up in 1947.

"I agree. 

I won't lie: I expected a mindfuck. Like he could fuck with time in Dunkirk. But this feels like a rushed and sloppy summary of a book Nolan read and eagerly needed to put into film. 

The soundtrack is underwhelming. Tenet was much more gripping. The opening scene for Tenet was amazing, pulled me in. This didn't until way into the third hour when I got confused about the whodunnit-bit with Strauss. While the riddle with Einstein is not as important as it is presented. 

Murphy is a good actor but I dislike the supposed physical likeness that underlines ones actingskills. Also, Branaghs obligatory cameos tire me. 

I really needed some more upfucking of worlds. I could do without the love drama.",2023-07-23 19:51:24

It just shouldn't have been a biopic. Oppenheimer's life is not interesting enough to require a biopic - the bombs are bigger than him.

Black and white scenes are to show from Strauss perspective. It's an art choice of Nolan to differentiate   between Oppenheimer and Strauss perspective. And also don't forget the movie is based on a biographical book.

"""The wife Kitty goes from being a useless drunk that he’s stuck with because he knocked her up to being the most badass character in the final 30 minutes. ""

Except, this happened in real life. >!Oppenheimer wanted to be contrite and not combative during the security hearing, but was feckless and overwhelmed by the withering, acrimonious interrogation he was subjected to by Roger Robb, the aggressive prosecutor hired by the AEC. Kitty Oppenheimer may have been an alcoholic and uncaring mother and she may have had her disagreements with her husband, but she nonetheless loved Robert deeply. So after a few days of seeing her husband being subjected to a kangaroo court, Kitty made every opportunity to vociferously defend herself and her husband and bring the fight back to his opponents when she was under cross examination.!<

""But it makes all the drama about him LOSING security clearance at a time he’s apparently no longer involved in the AEC even sillier""

Except, again that is EXACTLY what happened. >!Oppenheimer's security clearance was set to expire in 1954. But even without it, Oppenheimer would have remained the one of the most prominent and influential public intellectuals in the country, if not the world. His political enemies, Strauss chief among them, wanted to finally and utterly remove him from having any influence in the conversation regarding nuclear policy, as they viewed Oppenheimer's opposition to the hydrogen bomb and his advocation for international nuclear disarmament as dangerous to American military interests, if not outright traitorous. So, taking advantage of the era of peak McCarthyism, they ambushed him by relitigating his past associations with Communists. And they were successful in forcing him into exile.!<",2023-07-21 14:41:56

"I’ve seen some very well articulated criticisms that made me rethink certain aspects of the movie. However, for the US audiences that were expecting the successful execution of the bomb to be the plot driver of the movie, I do wonder how much of that comes from our culture around WW2 movies having a certain, clear tangible and moral driving force, so people went into this movie expecting another “how our boys defeated the Axis powers” that comes from being from a nation that was one of WW2’s winners. 

I’m not doubting an appreciation for complexity (I think those digs are pretty simplistic and cheap), I’m just wondering if part of the expectations/dislike at least in the US comes from our shared longstanding traditions behind telling very specific types of stories when the subject matter is about anything relating to WW2. Most WW2 movies would have ended around Oppenheimer’s ‘success’ speech, maybe even after his press tour/convo with Truman.",2023-07-22 16:55:53

Because for a biopic it doesn't really tell me much about his character, his backstory, what got him into physics, why he was sympathetic to communism, what his drives are, etc., I watched 3 hours about the guy and I still barely know him besides his involvement with the Manhattan project, some of his spicy (but narratively unnecessary) personal affairs and his legal troubles with the Atomic Energy Commission after the war.

For a documentary, this is just a 3 hour long expositions upon expositions, expositions about new characters, new locations, confusing time jumps between past and present, constant non-stop fast cuts between scenes so much so that even emotional scenes lose their emotional impact because the audience isn't given time and room to feel the impact before it instantly jumps to another scene with more info expositions.

I dare you to tell me you <75% understood and followed exactly who was who, who did what and what actually was going on in the movie at all times on your first viewing.

Characters talk like they are in an epic or Shakespearean play, it sounds cool but that isn't how real people talk in real life, and almost every scene is accompanied by an epic orchestra score even when it's unearned or insignificant in the narrative. Nolan just wants every scene to feel overly epic, and I think that has become a massive detriment to his films.

There are some truly stellar scenes when they are actually given runtime, but these are less than 10% of the entire film.

I think Nolan still hasn't learned from his mistakes from Tenet and really dropped the ball on this one.",2023-07-24 08:16:07

Totally agree. The Trinity test was a big let down for me visually. A wide angle watching it detonate from a far rather than jumping to everyone's reaction would have been a lot stronger of a visual.

"I agree with you that the film is too cumbersome. I told my friend that if Nolan wanted to cover so many of the minutiae of Oppenheimer’s life, they should have done so in a miniseries where his life could be have been better developed over the course of several hour-long episodes—though Nolan doesn’t make miniseries, so oh well. 

But I actually found the boardroom and confirmation  session in the latter half of the film to be the most compelling. The security clearance meant clearly more than just security clearance to all the people who were involved. There seems to be this interesting dissonance between the terror and sheer significance of scientific revolution and the petty, egocentric nature of our political process.",2023-08-03 00:46:32
"If you know real life and history then you’d realize that premise doesn’t make sense though. We beat the Nazis by a long shot and they were out of the war before the bombs were even dropped. 

If you want a race to the finish biopic go watch Air on Amazon Prime (good movie but not on the same planet as Oppenheimer), what we got was much better than that.

And losing his security clearance means he will no longer have any say whatsoever in how his creation will be used. Which is a big deal for him if you payed attention to the goddamn movie.",2023-08-03 04:06:32

This was brilliantly acted by Cillian Murphy. Emily Blunt's accent was distractingly atrocious, and the movie reminded me that RDJ can actually act.

For some reason I find Nolan increasingly gimmicky now. His focus on hamfisted symbolism, overwrought sound design, and deviation from straight-forward story progression - even when it adds nothing to the movie - is frankly boring.

It's a solid 5 for me. Would be a 6.5 if it was edited down. I wish they had added more about the moral play and its impact on Oppenheimer rather than looking at it from a largely clinical, politicking angle.

As with all Nolan movies, the moving parts are all there, but there is no humanity, and especially for a movie like this, no attempt to explore the human condition.",2023-07-22 04:22:21

"The significance of that scene was showing Einstein was rejected by his own countrymen (the political leadership particularly) after all his hard work and achievements. The same was done to Oppenheimer.

Oppenheimer was an outspoken advocate for nuclear arms reduction and international cooperation and for being that was torn down and humiliated by militant advocates of arms proliferation. I think you should feel bad for him.

Oppenheimer and Strauss were at odds politically, Oppenheimer being a left-wing internationalist and Strauss being a right-wing nationalist. Strauss was also a political creature who operates primarily in his own self interest, where Oppenheimer was naive to politics (shown many times in the movie for his advocacy of left-wing groups and ideas despite the hostility of the establishment) and was guided more by acting for the greater good.

The last scene Alden Ehrenreich's character really demonstrates the difference between Oppenheimer and Strauss. While Strauss is shown obsessing with the idea that Oppenheimer was conspiring against him, Ehrenreich's character bring up the idea (which is shown to be true) that what Oppenheimer and Einstein were discussing was in fact more important than petty politics.",2023-07-21 04:17:26

And with this, it's a sign that you no longer control what you innovated. Einstein lead physics, was the leading mind, but by that point had become overshadowed by Oppenheimer. He was the old man who enjoyed being by the lake. Similar to the bomb, physics was going to stop being under Oppenheimer's control.

Two points. 

1. Oppie likes her because she's this strong woman who's dedicated to the communist party/their general idea of helping others/communist ideology. It's not exactly a clash of identities more like they appreciated each other for what the other represented. She's rude to him cause he won't commit to the party, won't officially join and that puts a strain of their relationship. She's also independent so it's on and off. Basically she won't commit to him romantically (throws away flowers) cause he won't commit to the ideology she lives by. Push and pull.

I don't think this was what was being expressed, more how she felt violated by it being paraded out in front of the panel (which she pretty much states outright). So less haunted by it happening, and more disgusted by it being brought out into 'public' view.

I do understand the desire to keep CGI out of the detonation (though there's obvious bits in the final moments). But yeah, the lack of the iconic mushroom cloud or more of the initial globular fireball/shockwave did end up robbing the film of some pretty iconic imagery.

In isolation it's an ok scene, though it could have been developed more slowly and suspensefully. But in the context of the larger film... what's the point? To show that Kitty has grit? Ok but...so? She still can't change his rather irrelevant fate and it really doesn't reveal anything new about her. We didn't necessarily know she was quick with words but we knew she was pretty assertive.

Cillian Murphy and Downey Jr. were great and there were nice surprises like Josh Hartnett who I thought was really good in his role. This was one of Damon’s better roles too and it was nice to see him in a military type role. Blunt being interrogated was a good part too. Other than his girlfriends communist ties, it spent way too much time on his womanizing, which wasn’t really important in the context of the film. From Trinity to the end, it was a very intense movie. The mixing and I’ve heard a few people say this, was bad. Sound shouldn’t be so loud it’s draining out dialogue, especially when it was the committee just arguing with him and you knew they were going to be against him to begin with. I think the theme of an atomic bomb having no place in a modern world and killing so many everyday citizens needed to be hammered home more, because that is the general sentiment of people nowadays. Nuclear power has the power to end civilization. Was too long too, could’ve easily been like 2:15-30.",2023-07-27 00:45:53

It was an action movie without the traditional action scenes. Every scene was intense and I didn't feel bored a single minute of it. This isn't me trying to be mean or anything but if you genuinely think that the dialogue meant absolutely nothing then idk you probably weren't paying any attention. They were going back and forth about the ramifications of the atomic bomb and the change in political landscape that would come with it. The guilt that Oppenheimer felt and the way he was labeled from war hero to maybe a treasonous commie would at least be good enough for the movie to not be the MOST boring movie ever.,2023-07-22 15:07:00

"I swear Emily Blunt's character was the only one that was 2-d. Oppenheimer boiled down to ""I'm just doing my job here, but I feel REALLY really bad about it!"" Everyone else was forgettable.

Everyone brings up ""isn't it SO fucked how little of a reaction most characters had to the mass killings? the REAL horror is how quickly they moved on."" but Nolan didn't care enough to even attempt to develop this. Within this movie, it was effectively a victimless crime. 

The most we see him try is by having Oppenheimer picture the gymnasium crowd as explosion victims, and stepping on that charred baby - but this is neutered by Emily Blunt's (correct) ""you don't get to sin and then expect us to feel all sorry for you"" line",2023-07-26 08:11:52
"Wanted to get my thoughts down too.

Nolan is my favorite active director. He has a half dozen five star movies in my book. A legend in his own time. However, I walked out of Tenet. I found it incomprehensible and just didn't care to watch the last twenty minutes.

Maybe it was high expectations or the world-changing source material, but I left disappointed. It was beautifully shot, acted, and scored. But the movie's structure was needlessly convoluted and groaned under the weight of its runtime. 

I can understand beginning with the hearings. Red Scare hysteria corrupted the US government and led to the ruination of many great men. But the back and forth took a good story and made it difficult to follow for someone without any familiarity with the subject. A normal, linear narrative would have made it clearer that the US was first to develop the bomb because of Oppenheimer's prodigious abilities only to betray him a few short years later. It's as if Nolan thinks linear stories are boring and presumes his audience agrees. Or maybe he doesn't care. Either way, it was a bit tedious. 

And the bigger problem was the length. I don't have a problem with a 3 hr movie, but there needs to be cohesion. Maybe it's sacrilege to say, but this probably would have been better as a limited series. Once the movie's focus re-centered on the 1950s, and there was still 45 minutes left, I knew we were in trouble. This is somewhat amazing considering the first hour covered ground and introduced characters with breakneck speed.

Unpopular opinions probably. Maybe even unfair. I'm looking forward to watching it at home and hopefully enjoying it more. But I thought the movie was kind of a drag.",2023-08-01 14:18:58
"I agree as well. I am a Nolan fanboy as well and I am a physics student. I was looking forward to this movie hard. 

The production value, music and acting is absolutely top notch... 

But the writing is so bad and boring ... it seems so full of text that doesn't have any substance. It is like half of the text and scenes are completely unnecessary. The movie could've been easily a 1.5 hour movie. 

Its just a biopic of a guy made in a confusing way, where the guy is interesting but not interesting enough for a movie of more than 3 hours. There are dozens more interesting physics persons in history. Also they made Einstein an awful caricature of himself.. That was a crime

I also think they wasted a really important opportunity to show the atom bomb droppings and the horrors the japanese people had to endure. There was nothing shown about the japanese suffering, only hinted. Maybe it was a deliberate choice, but I think it was chosen badly. Or the US government didn't want it included or whatever",2023-07-30 06:02:27

"I'd like offer a few points (politely) in response to this:

1. Trailers are made to show exciting moments in a film. I can almost guarantee that Nolan had no involvement in the trailer itself, as those get put together by the marketing department and usually a third party company who specialises in making trailers. So watching a trailer and thinking, ""Oh, I see what this director is going to be doing with this move,"" is a bit silly. This is a Nolan biopic film, not Fast & Furious 10 where you've seen the trailer means you've basically seen the film.

2. This is a biopic about a scientist. We weren't going to be watching 3 hours of exploding bombs. I'm also not surprised we didn't see the actual bomb being dropped. This is about a person's life, and like most people, it's not full of action and surprises, it's people talking in rooms.

3. This is a Nolan film. Even his more action filled movies, like the Dark Knight Films and Inception for example, include a lot of dialogue. There are whole scenes in the Dark Knight films where characters explain why they are doing things, what their philosophy is, et cetera. Inception has some of the best action set pieces in Nolan's filmography and yet whole chunks of the film are exposition and characters dialoguing.

4. The actual trailer you link to also includes many scenes of various poeple, talking.",2023-07-23 10:59:11
"Well it’s a biopic about a physicist, considered one of the brightest minds, so the dialogue-heavy part shouldn’t be too much of a surprise.  And we already know his work/the project, so the political component of the movie also shouldn’t be a surprise. If you didn’t know the details of the accusations against him I can see how there is a bit of a surprise there. Did you expect an action scene though? He was a real person not an avenger lol",2023-07-23 07:53:38

">If the narrative were told more linearly in a conventional manner, I think it would be better. As it is, this movie feels like you need to go in already knowing the cliffnotes of his life to even follow the film.

Yeah I mentioned this in a recent comment. Since I knew nothing about Robert Oppenheimer going in (except that he helped invent the bomb) the rest was all new to me, and it was a lot to absorb. I had no idea about the suspected communist sympathies, the security clearance issue, Strauss (at all), his personal life, I'd heard of Edward Teller and some of the others but just by name. When you combine it with the back-and-forth timelines it almost felt like I was desperately cramming for a test, trying to soak up as much information as possible.

"I agree entirely. I wanted to like it, but I left disappointed. It's not a bad film by any means, but I feel like it's a missed opportunity for a great film. It had simply phenomenal cinematography and acting. But the editing and storytelling were subpar, and downright confusing at times. And the use of A-listers gave away the plot in their importance; it left no mystery or nuance on what side character might have a surprising role later on. 

Also, there are too many call-back references; it almost became comedic at how often that occurred. And I really disliked how we see the horror of what the A-Bomb means mainly through Cillian Murphy's acting; I fee like they should have *shown* some of the horrors so that we could feel it, too, and not just seem him react. It left you sympathetic to what he went through, but not actually feeling it yourself. It was almost shallow, since we actually know what the horrors were.

And the pacing was terrible! It felt like they tried to cram a 5 hour movie into 3 hours, it was painful to endure. The part I enjoyed the most was in the second act with the 'lets build our team' phase where they took committed more time to a specific part of the plot, to really let that story unfold more organically. That, and the very ending with the reveal of Oppenheimer's and Einstein's conversation -- those were both done very well.",2023-07-27 03:29:02

1) Without security clearance, Oppenheimer is limited in his ability to affect policy with government officials.  He can't attend certain meetings.    
2) It shows how science is always mixed with politics.  Science is not pure the way citizens like to sometimes imagine.  
3) It shows how polarized the two sides are.  The side that wants military/nuclear strength will do anything to win against the side that wants military/nuclear peace agreements.  They'll even use false accusations of disloyalty and break proper process & decorum.",2023-08-03 11:01:13
"People can differ here but my take was a gradual shifting of how one controls a big idea, and/or how one affects change through their field or area of impact. I thought it was well rendered. The film starts off with Oppenheimer gaining more impact and control over his field, but there are clear places where he has to compromise. By the end, he has been completely consumed by the vindictiveness of a politician and his impact has been collapsed. I thought it was interesting and effective in making this point. Again though, everyone can have different opinions!",2023-08-03 19:57:38

"A few things

1.	⁠The money shot, in my opinion, is the speech after the bomb drops in Japan.  Artistically I found this to be one of the most interesting scenes I’ve ever seen in theaters.
2.	⁠I think, in general, you’re right. The general public will not “love” this movie because of its complexity and difficulty paying attention to a dialogue heavy film for 3 hours.

I snuck in a flask during the movie and I swear having a little bit of whisky in my system allowed me to be incredibly focused on only the dialogue and nothing else happening around me.

This movie requires that you be 100% focused and it is unforgiving in that. The irony is that it’s best viewed with an insane sound system, but you damn near need an intermission in the middle of the film.

I think critically this will receive a mountain of well deserved praise, but the public will push back for the exact reasons you describe above.

I personally loved it. But I understand your points as well.

I want to mention that what this really is attempting - is to be two movies tied into one.

Bingo! My exact thoughts. It’s overly complicated which muddles the story and robs it’s emotional beats. I don’t agree in the dialogue.

That's the real conflict, the guilt and turmoil that the consequences of his actions seem to bring him. The story is brilliantly told, almost spiritual in its depiction. The security clearance bit is just a smokescreen for how the world we lived in (or rather still do) functions and how even geniuses like oppenheimer are but disposable material for people in positions of real power.

I appreciate that the writing team tried to portray the historical events somewhat faithfully, and the involvement of various giants whose collective work lead to humans splitting the atom (it was such a rush, I got flashbacks to my highschool chemistry and physics books). However, this movie should have easily been split into 2 parts (perhaps 2 or even 2.5 hours each) to cover the significance of events that were portrayed, the historical background, the society at the time and the various physics, chemistry, and ideological concepts, even people that were mentioned for (what felt like) namesake. Dare I say, Death of Stalin was more engaging despite being a farce and a stage play being shown on a screen in terms of its historical content.I didn't watch Tenet, but I think Nolan's work has gone downhill in terms of quality post Inception. Interstellar was very captivating, but it also wasn't convincing enough in terms of the emotions it was trying to portray. Dunkirk was a pure audio-visual feast only meant to be watched at a theatre, it falls flat during a rewatch in a living room. I think Nolan should try working with a writer, and perhaps get Lee Smith back for editing. What a waste of an ensemble cast that nobody else could put together, and Cillian especially wasted. Visually spectacular, as is Nolan's signature but an unconvincing adaption of the biography perhaps due to its pacing - I would've loved for it to be a 2 part film or a BBC-esque mini series spanning 6 our even 8 hours.",2023-08-05 20:08:56

There's a lot of talk about the actual nuke footage being more akin to a big fart than the actual atomic bomb but to me that is just small detail because despite that, the actual scene is very good imo. It's just the rest of the movie isn't. It's confusing, doesn't really pull you in for Oppie like you said, not to mention an ear rape movie as usual with Nolan. In some other thread I saw someone say that the explosion was the greatest moment he had seen in his life/movie history and I was baffled. Did we even see the same movie?

I know I was happy that I didn't pay extra to see this in IMAX (it's quite expensive where I live) because the only it would have been good for would have been the nuke that was so lackluster.

"I think I personally like the movie & maybe you didn't.

>This movie was not good. None of the drama was compelling. Even after three hours of watching this tripe I didn't feel like I knew or understood any of these characters on a deep or familiar level.

It wasn't a drama , it was facts , clearly & plainly presented. You need context & a lot of it to understand what actually happened. 

>The movie barely even tries to make the audience connect with Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's sympathies with the Communist Party are barely explored. Oppenheimer's romantic relationships are barely explored. Oppenheimer's attempt to poison his professor is glossed over. Oppenheimer's guilt over the nuke is used to bludgeon the audience over the head, but not in a way that actually teaches anybody anything. I know he feels remorse, but in real life remorse tends to be a nuanced emotion. Oppenheimer's remorse is presented to the audience in the form of ear rape and unexpected nudity.

Oppenheimer never had connections with Communist Party , when the president of US realized the backlash he was going to get after the bomb was dropped & all the group of scientists stood against the govt (you need context for this too , how the German scientists ended up in US , what the Nazis motives were , why the bomb was dropped , other plans , etc) , he was just painted as a communist. Yes , Oppenheimer did have lots of nefarious relationships. Not to mention his guilt made him chainsmoke himself to death.

Oppenheimers remorse required far more depth & understanding, I don't know what you expected from it. 

>When Truman called Oppenheimer a crybaby, I should've been outraged. Instead I was like, ""Yo, this dude's got a point."" This would've been impossible had Nolan actually given me any reason to connect with Oppenheimer's character.

It was a biopic from the POV of Oppenheimer himself. Sex scenes , & stuff like that was largely not required , because it wasn't a drama , it was just a clear visual representation between the bomb & its creator.

You need context & a lot of it. Maybe its not something that most people can connect to on a regular basis , but hey , not everyone gets to meet nuclear weapon scientists & engineers on a regular basis.",2023-07-25 08:38:17

Him seeing the ""clichéd"" skin melting off is a particular contrast to the group watching photos from Hiroshima.

We ever only see his reaction to the photos, rather than the photos themselves, and after that, the photos start to come into his hallucinations.

That's not about Robert. It's what Kitty sees and reflects her personality. She was very jealous of Jean Tatlock and drank her way through the affair.

"I think all the focus on the character drama and politics is to highlight how dangerous the bomb is. It's to show that we have placed the power to destroy the planet in the hands of flawed human beings, where even the scientific geniuses among us are full of ego, mistakes, regrets, and petty envy.

"I personally believe that focusing more on the hearings really made this an ""oppenheimer"" movie. If more focus was put on the atomic bomb drops or the Manhattan project, it would have been less about oppenheimer and more about the war. The movie showed all that it needs to about the man himself in my opinion, and I enjoy that it didn't lean heavily into the actual war. It was a movie about oppenheimer and not WW2.",2023-07-26 06:36:25

You personally having no interest in it is fine.. but the movie does and spends a lot of its running time, since the beginning, talking about politics, academia, money, ideology, war, and all the shitty human elements involved... fear, greed, envy, pride... so what Eistein says has everything to do with the rest of the film.

I understand your perspective if came into this looking for a play by play on Oppenheimer the man... but without that context he is not that interesting. 

You said it yourself... Oppenheimer is not Einstein... the movie knows that. The Manhattan Project is just part of a chain reaction of bullshit and ignorance. That's why it's looking at the bigger picture.",2023-07-26 14:31:58

But then, when she's in the position to defend herself in front of the gray board, she realizes it's not as easy as she thinks it is.

"This was my first reaction too, but after reflecting more I think it makes sense that we're not shown the actual bombings. The movie wasn't about the bombs, or the war, or nuclear energy - it was about Oppenheimer. He spends his life's work developing a weapon that he never sees in use, so we follow his story but never see the bombs again once they leave Los Alamos. As the movie emphasized, once they left the lab they were completely out of his control, and he learns about their use at the same time as the rest of the world, over the public radio message.


You say that the bombing in Japan was ""the actual event that defined Oppenheimer"", and that's the real tragedy of his story - that the public heavily associates Hiroshima + Nagasaki with Oppie even though the Trinity Test was really his crowning achievement. So we're left kinda blueballed without seeing the real bombs in use, but we're supposed to, because that's exactly how he felt after his brainchild was handed over to the government.",2023-07-22 18:44:40

"Maybe I'm being too critical but I feel like they wrote a character driven movie but then forgot that they were supposed to have deep character interactions and decided to make up for it with all of the scene cutting and time skipping and all of that.

Strauss's disdain of Oppenheimer went way deeper than because of one public humiliation but that wasn't delved in to any deeper. And there are so many characters that aren't really developed. Then Oppenheimer himself, so he just hated himself and wanted to be martyred? Did he feel regret? (The real Oppenheimer didn't, at least not publicly), was he a narcissist who wanted attention? Did he care deeply for people? Is the whole point supposed to be that I leave the movie asking these questions?

In the same way I felt Inception was a heist film without any of the fun of a heist film, I felt this was a biopic without any of the meaty depth of a biopic.

Absolutely no reason for this film to be three hours long lol you're right. So much of it is one character saying something and then just cutting to three other people saying the same thing and then one guy refutes it so they cut to two others who agree with him and it just goes on and on and on and on and on.

"As someone who's not really a fan of Nolan: I think this movie works in spite of his style, moreover than because of it.

Nolan really has no subtlety as a filmmaker.  Early in the movie he wants to show how smart Oppenheimer was as a physicist.  How does he do that?  By blaring loud sounds and inserts of electrons spinning around atoms, musical swells etc

I feel like that sort of intense filmmaking is absolutely appropriate for the scenes relating to the first atomic tests, and Oppenheimer's speech to the crowd turning into visions of a nuclear holocaust.  It makes sense to be so intense there.

But in those early scenes I was just like.. why?  It would have been better for me if it was a bit more subdued, but Nolan just can't, he has to crank the intensity to 10 as often as he can.",2023-07-21 16:59:45
"What was pared back, exactly? The rapid cutting between four or five timelines made a normal linear story practically incoherent, and for no purpose whatsoever. He made a puzzle out of a story that should have been presented without preening displays of cleverness, just for the sake of being clever. And I say this having read the book twice. No character development, and clumsy non-introductions of all the other characters didn't help matters. This film is a mess.",2023-07-21 17:06:16
"At the same time too, I also think it's Nolan at his finest. He utilized all the aspects that are good, took out the bad, and we got this great, and legitimately intense film. Which kind of shocks me since it really wasn't the visual spectacle I thought it'd be",2023-07-21 16:56:23
"I think the significance of Isidor Rabi, ""The fat man on the train"" (who comes back later; it is sometimes hard to tell a bunch of identical haircuts apart) is that he's one of the few people who obviously, genuinely care about Oppenheimer as a *person*, instead of just a resource. Where everyone else is obsessed with possibilities and results, Rabi repeatedly asks how Oppie is *feeling*. He declines to take part in the project because of his strong moral grounds—which, it's implied, Oppenheimer shares, but Oppie lets his other ambitions overwhelm his fears. Rabi is the only one who notices that Oppie isn't eating and hands him food (twice). His role is to be an emotional grounding rod for Oppie—which Oppie rejects, repeatedly, but Rabi doesn't stop being his friend or being Real just because Oppenheimer is who he is. (To be fair, Kitty and Jean also address Oppie's emotions in different ways, but it hits different coming from a man and a fellow physicist.)",2023-07-21 22:22:49

I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I felt the first and third acts were not as well developed or paced as the second. The Manhattan Project portion of the film was Nolan at his best, whilst the lead up and aftermath could have benefited from more time to cook.

As.you said, too many scenes in the first act needed time to breathe. So many characters coming in and the film having to delve into the communist party affiliations, Oppenheimer's education and subsequent return to America and time at Berkley 

The fundamental experience of the movie is the audience rooting for Oppenheimer and the project to succeed, being totally invested in the trinity scene and then like the scientists, being conflicted by the implications and the results of their work in the hands of the government. The film achieves that, but it could have been soo much more effective if the first and third act weren't so break neck.",2023-07-24 05:26:20

Much of the excitement after the successful bomb test, which was such a brilliant, emotional and climactic moment, came from tense, quickly exchanged dialogue. I understand why it is important to examine Oppenheimer's life after that moment as they did, but it dragged on entirely too long.

When it first started, they separated the time frames by title: 1. Fusion and 2: Fission (which maybe I mixed them around) and I was expecting some Dunkirk-level excitement and drama. But, it didn't pan out. Excellently acted but underdeveloped in many ways. Cillian Murphy was brilliant.",2023-07-24 17:46:43

"> the final scene discredits that because clearly the movie made a statement that was larger than Oppenheimer about nuclear war

People read things differently, but we spend the entire movie looking through the lens of how Oppenheimer felt about the bomb. That's why people keep saying it's a movie about Oppenheimer, because it's about his views and reactions to the bomb, not the consequences of the bomb itself. 

Even the security clearance scenes all revolve around Oppenheimer's opinion on the bomb. 

So it's weird to me that people read the ending scene to be preachy in some way. When you think about the context of the rest of the film, it's entirely how Oppenheimer felt about the consequences of developing the bomb.",2023-07-25 13:53:10

If we got a scene showing the planes dropping the bombs or showing a cabinet meeting discussing the strategy of their use without Oppenheimer there, that would have undermined the total lack of control we're meant to feel from him once the project finishes its work.",2023-07-25 19:30:06

I'd also argue that by refusing to show the extreme horror of dropping a nuclear weapon on two civilian centers, vaporizing, melting and burning thousands of people instantly and effecting them years after is letting audiences off the hook. It's typical of American movies on the subject.",2023-07-22 12:34:38

"> Florence Pugh is great, has like 5 lines, but loooks great except that one scene which was why that even crosses a persons mind?

You mean the imaginary sex in the committee room? I found that to be one of the most creative scenes of the movie. Oppenheimer's secrets are being exposed, so he's as naked in front of these people, and his wife feels the full shame of having his cheating discussed in front of all these inquiring strangers. So it's like she sees the other woman staring at her while literally fucking her husband. You don't get much more visceral than that with a visual metaphor.",2023-07-22 06:05:57
"I felt the film was trying to tell the story of Oppenheimer the man, the scientist who was an equal to that of Einstein, a name synonymous with genius. Where America's politicians were fueled by power, Oppenheimers pursuit was scientific, and he was motivated by the idea of defending the world against the Nazis, not by bombing the Japanese. He understood that it was the threat of the bomb that would be enough. I think it was effective in reframing his motivations and perception, highlighting his integrity as a rigorous and inventive scientist while also displayinf the impact of his choices.",2023-07-22 05:48:34

Yeah, I thought the whole book 'n' fuck scene was needless and cheesy as hell, I think they could have introduced the Sanskrit line better somewhere else in the film. 

The questioning scene where he admits cheating was also strange, she's obviously gorgeous but still...just felt out of place and cheap really.

I’m still waiting.

And this is a throwaway, but the overuse of bass early in the movie destroyed the impact of the bass sequence that should have been reserved for the big explosion. How is Nolan so overfocused on film techniquery in every other aspect, yet blows this e=mc2 of sound design. I watched this in Dolby Cinema with state of the art sound and premium leather recliners outfitted with vibration technology. The repeated early particle drop-ins with ultra-bass were way better than the actual bomb. And sticking to what I presume was the actual delay from flash-to-shock wave was an awful decision. Like, yes, give a delay, but it’s a dramatic movie, the delay doesn’t have to be what it was. The flash and the long wait punctured the balloon and deflated the scene. This is arthouse filmmaking, emphasizing technique over nuance and technicality over soul. It’s Rain Man OCD brought to a big budget film.",2023-07-27 14:30:25

I thought they did a great job with the sound of the shockwave, etc., it's just that I'm sorry but a nuclear bomb does not look like a giant plume of fire. It's instantaneously violent. The way they shot it with slow burning clouds of fire looked more like napalm or diesel than even conventional explosives. 

When a nuke goes off, there's a few shocking seconds where the world goes white yet stays silent. You can feel the destruction rolling toward you, even though you can't see. I honestly would have rather they put in some old stock footage of the explosion than attempt to poorly replicate a mushroom cloud, they do the speed and violence of such a terrible bomb disservice.",2023-07-25 07:37:26

"I disagree. It wasnt a war movie and not focused on really anything but oppenheimer, even the scenes where cillian wasnt present the only convo was about oppenheimer.

Not seeing the bombs was the experience Oppenheimer had, feeling completely left out of the loop and only finding out through the wireless.

And the non-linear storytelling just didn't work for me in this situation. Mostly because it just seemed too haphazard..there wasn't a specific design behind why some things are shown at specific moments..if that makes sense.

I did think Cillian Murphy was fantastic (as he is in pretty much anything he does) and he really carries this film on his back. The rest of the cast was very good as well. I'll prob see it again just for that reason..but my first viewing thought is that it was an okay movie that could have been good/great if it wasn't held back by a director trying to be too clever for his own good.",2023-08-02 23:54:25

I have read American Prometheus and I should say I was still struggling to keep in mind who Boris Pash, William Borden, Lomanitz, etc were... That said, it took just the first 5-10 minutes for me to “lock in” to the energy and flow of the film.

Maybe this style of storytelling doesn’t work for everyone, but it works for me.",2023-07-22 07:08:41

"I have a weird fixation/anxiety about nuclear war. The concept has terrified me since I was a child even though I grew up well after the cold war. The logical part of my brain knows the odds of one day dying in a fiery holocaust are near zero. 

However, just like with the trinity test potentially igniting the atmosphere, near zero doesn't quite cut it for me. And the events of the past few years really haven't helped. Knowing it could happen at any time, at the hands of a single or small group of people, will never cease to terrify me until the day all nukes are gone, which obviously won't come. 

Because of this, I was deeply horrified by the ending.  Thinking about it after the fact though, it was a bit ham-fisted and over the top. It felt especially out of place movie that chose to be less explicit with things like Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All I really know now, is Christopher Nolan definitely shares my anxiety lol",2023-07-23 00:12:52

"Agreed with you on the third act dragging. But I think it makes sense to not show the bombs drop on Japan. We're getting the perspective of Oppenheimer and the other researchers who worked on the project. They built it, it was shipped off and then one day they heard on the radio that it was used and the war was over. They were completely removed from its impact, which left all the death and destruction that it caused to ruminate only in Oppenheimer's imagination.",2023-07-30 20:20:30
"With regard to showing the effect of the bombs… we know what the effect is. Other movies have done that. It was in a Wolverine movie fercrisake. This movie was a look at Oppenheimer’s subjective experience, not a newsreel about events that have been portrayed on film many times.

And with regards to the sex… what makes ANYTHING in a movie necessary? Does it have to be necessary in order to merit inclusion? Or does it merely have to evoke a response? The sex portrayed in the appeal scene was showing what was going through Kitty’s head - it was a fine way to show it. The only reason that this stuff is titillating is because we’re so protective about it. This was a movie for adults - most adults are comfortable with sex. It would be odd to try not to be triggering in a movie about the (still unresolved!) stakes of a nuclear arms race.",2023-07-30 10:32:21
Because neither of the female leads get any real character development in this film. Like a lot of his films the women are plot devices to develop other characters/plot. For a character study it sure lacked characterization,2023-07-22 21:35:02

"Agree that Oppenheimer felt empty, even if I was immersed as well. 

To be fair to JFK, it's rivetting and has compelling scenes where the stakes are clear: who killed the president? And there's a 'sinister' side to the government that really leaves you feeling a bit haunted by it all, even if the claims are stretched and not exactly true. If Nolan focused on the 'sinister' US government pumping out hundreds and hundreds of A-Bombs, and the silencing of Oppenheimer was to get pacifists out of the way, it would've packed a better punch. Rather than it being Strauss' revenge, which is just about someone's ego. Both narratives are true, but the former is a clearer antecedent to today's situation. 

By 1959 when the final scenes of Oppenheimer take place, there was something like 5,000+ nukes between the USSR and USA. But the state of geopolitics seemed completely left out, almost like what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was in a vacuum.",2023-07-31 16:45:35

"* It's definitely Nolan at his most self-indulgent for better and worse. Think closer to Dunkirk than Interstellar.
* You could shave a good quarter off the movie and not change anything. 
* Characters still mumble dialogue and are overpowered by music in a few scenes. 
* The female characters seem to exist for eye candy or to make an occasional quip to male characters - Nolan's assertion that this movie is his best attempt at a romance is quite a shock after seeing the film.
* The final quarter of the film (which is quite interesting admittedly) feels like an entirely different film.

The dialogue being barely audible in Nolan movies is humurously highlighted in the movie when Murphy does an attempt at speaking Dutch.
It sounded more like German and it wasnt convincing. Couldnt understand a thing.

Can be over hyped, sure. I wasn't as blown away as I was hoping, so can understand that. But I was completely surprised by how many people are going to this.

But also, it seemed like the black and white had much less to do with the timeline and more to do with the perspective. When the story was from Robert Downey Jr.’s perspective (or, at least, when he was the focus), it was black and white. When it was from Oppenheimer’s, it was in color (with the exception of the first few hearing scenes, if I recall correctly).

*He* didn't create it by himself, he was head of a project that involved 4000 people and it would have gone ahead without him. Also they were in a race to create it before the Nazis (eventually at least, though the Nazis were defeated before Trinity), which gives important context as to why he was eager to build it.

"It's up to you if you want to interpret it that way, but I think that's a really black and white view of morality. Many people worked on the bomb project, for many reasons. Those reasons and their views of the bomb changed over time. It's IMO a wrong, possibly even dangerous view to imagine that bad inhumane things must arise from inhumane people. It was not inevitable that it would be used on a civilian target - in fact, Truman assumed it would not be. He had a whole speech drafted where he boasted that the Hiroshima bombing killed no innocent people because it was a ""purely military target""!

Oppenheimer and many of his colleagues' remorse absolutely wasn't fabricated. You need to consider it in the context of the time when the US was absolutely gung-ho for the nuke. Taking that position when he did wasn't some point scoring thing, it took a lot of courage and put his reputation in the dirt. It would be much easier to just shut up and accept being a national hero.

They didn't show the 100-ton TNT shot, they didn't show Jumbo, they didn't show the aftermath at ground zero.  All in all, I was totally disappointed  with everything related to atomic bomb development in the movie.  Pretty much, the atomic bomb development was just a minor side plot to the movie.

"I agree . Especially the sound design, I don't know what he's doing in the mixing room but he's gotta stop with the inaudible dialogue. Also it felt like the entire movie was constant tension buildup e en after the bomb. I can't remember anytime in the film there was background music except after the bomb exploded. Maybe that was on purpose but seriously it isn't neccessary to have something playing in the background 100% of the time, you can still set the scene with words and environmental sounds.

Also, I'm tired of the back and forth time jumping scene chopping Nolan does. In every film it's constant forwards, backwards, current, and it's all too quick, it's jarring, it's confusing, it doesn't add weight like some people think it does. It can be used well but when it's 90% of the film it's too much. Sometimes you gotta slow it down, we had 3 hours to explore the characters and connect to the story but nothing ever stuck because as soon as you start to feel something the scene skips. I think a mixed use of linear and jumpy storytelling would do Nolan better. In another comment I suggested going linear after the bomb but idk what's best.

The fission/fusion captions established this but it culminated at the end when we see the Eistein scene in color, when we've previously seen it in monochrome. The scene is the intersection of the two perspectives, it ccrescendos into a fission/fusion reaction (depends on how you see it). It led Strauss to start to doubt Oppenheimer, which plays to the events of the ""trials"" succeeding that scene and concluded Oppie's journey of creating the atomic bomb, whch were the events leading up that scene.

i havent seen a single example of an onscreen nuke in cg that felt even remotely real (ok maybe thats going to far, the nukes froma  distance in godzilla was pretty good, and the one in wolverine was good, but your brain just knows its not real, the shockwaves are always the hardest to get right), this feels real.

Strauss won his battle against Oppenheimer by exiling him from ever having any influence in nuclear policy again. But it Karmatically rebounded against him, and his political career ended after he was rejected by the Senate. So you can't really say Strauss unambigiously ""won"" in the end. Notwithstanding the fact that the entire episode is one of the blackest marks of the entirely shameful political witch hunts that McCarthyism brought on in the 50s.

Teller testifying against Oppenheimer was seen as a betrayal by the scientific community at large, and he was largely ostracized as a result. Exiled from academia, Teller effectively took up Oppie's old position as a renowned public intellectual advising politicians on scientific policy, although in his case he made court with Republicans like Nixon and Reagan.",2023-07-21 21:24:21

His measures were half-steps until the beast was released. 

I don't think the question about whether the bombs ultimately have saved lives is an interesting one, it clearly has but that can only be said until it's used again in which case game over.

Matt Damon proved this by breaking his acting break. One of these flash-appearances is Trond Fausa, who I recognised from the marvellous Bothersome Man. It bothered me he has such a tiny role, buried beneath all those other semi big stars.

Also! Also! Just a hand full of black actors pass quickly, I really wonder if they had access to the predominantly white environments we pass during the movie. It made it feel all the more forced and fake.

The other criticism, though, I want to address. I get that the pacing was a stylistic choice for the very purpose you describe. However, I feel that it is an approach that will alienate a lot of people and obscure details that need breathing room for a full depiction of the story. For instance, the pacing makes characters' choices in the film seem to be without motivation, because there is no time to give individual perspective on any given decision. Considering the subject matter, the motivations of those involved is vital to understanding the actions taken by many of the characters, and I feel the movie failed to make those motivations clear in several instances.",2023-07-24 02:32:15

"[According to Nolan](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxjT0esGI6fggCmBvpN3h0IELKKqUjOVr1), yeah. Maybe there's some argument of hyperbole there, but I think we may need to wait for the blu-ray for better answers.

My best guess for the end is the atmosphere burning reminded me of [these kinds of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU05jvzSI5g). Play around with the scale and include different additives to effect the smoke density and it could be done I'd think.",2023-07-24 18:01:45
"1. It was his code for letting her know the test went was a success (because he couldn't say anything directly). When he calls her to say don't bring them in he's telling her that they have revoked his security clearance.
2. Iirc the spy was the british scientist who Oppenheimer very briefly spoke to. ""How long have you been british?"" ""Since Hitler told me I was no longer German"". 
The guy who's hand she refused to shake was the H-Bomb Scientist who turned on Oppenheimer in the security clearence appeal because he was mad that Oppenheimer opposed the H-Bomb project.",2023-07-27 12:02:37

"Strauss invited him to take a position at Princeton in 1947, which is when the Einstein scene takes place. Strauss had nothing to do with Berkeley, which Oppenheimer started teaching at in '28 or '29 I believe.",2023-08-06 03:37:15
"\> When Oppenheimer talked to Einstein at the pond, wasn't that supposed to be when 

\> Oppenheimer first started teaching? 

No. That was when Strauss hired Oppenheimer to teach at Princeton. Oppenheimer first started teaching in California, at Berkley and CalTech. Oppenheimer was invited to join Princeton in 1947, after the war. Right before they go out to the pond you see Strauss and Oppenheimer meet for the first time and Strauss tells him about the job at Princeton, his house etc. Einstein is out by the pond because Einstein taught and lived there at Princeton. Einstein never taught in California. 

\> There were two scenes, one in the beginning and one at the end. 

It was the same scene by the pond, revisited several times from the perspective of Straus then, finally, at the end, revealing what Einstein and Oppenheimer really talked about. They were not at different times. It was the same conversation but we see it from Strauss' perspective, until the ending revelation of what Einstein and Oppenheimer actually spoke about. 

\> The first scene, Oppenheimer started his teaching career at Berkley, and he talked to > Einstein at the pond. This was before he made the bomb. 

No, see above. It had nothing to do with Berkeley and took place in New Jersey, not California. It was after the war in 1947 when Strauss offered Oppenheimer a job at Princeton.  

\> In the second scene, we find out that Oppenheimer told Einstein that he believes the 

\> world will be destroyed, implying the pond scene was after the creation of the bomb. > Is this just a plothole?

Respectfully, you are confused. See above that it is the same scene flashed back to several times, but also, did you miss the scenes earlier in the movie about the chain reaction? Teller calculated a chance that a nuclear bomb could potentially alight the atmosphere and therefore destroy everything on Earth. He presented it to the team and Oppenheimer in the early days of the Project. Then there is a scene where Oppenheimer visits Einstein in New Jersey and shows him Teller's work and solicits his opinion. (In reality, Oppenheimer went to Arthur Compton in Chicago, but Nolan changed it to Einstein for dramatic effect). 

In that scene, Einstein suggests to Oppenheimer that Hans Bethe should run the calculations and will arrive at the correct answer, whatever that is. Oppenheimer asks what to do if Bethe confirms that the bomb would destroy the world. Einstein replies that Oppenheimer should share those calculations with the Nazis in the hopes that the data would be scary enough to stop everyone. 

That earlier scene is the one referenced in the dialogue at the end. Both men now know by the pond scene that the bombs did not set fire to the atmosphere. However, Oppenheimer's ending line indicates he believes that nuclear weapons will ultimately destroy the world. That comment caused Einstein to have a distraught look on his face as he walked away from the pond. Einstein was so disturbed that he walked past Strauss and ignored his greeting. Strauss was paranoid and concluded that Oppenheimer had said something about Strauss to Einstein to make Einstein suddenly ignore him. Strauss was paranoid and sensitive about not having a scientific/academic background, despite working in those fields, and was obsessed with having the ""respect"" of scientists. The thought that Oppenheimer and Einstein might have been belittling him or making fun of him triggered him, though the reality is they were not talking about him at all.",2023-08-06 07:09:47

"I agree that visually it wasn't fantastic. Tarantino used the large format for expanding intimidate scenes better in The Hateful Eight (I know it's not shoot on IMAX but it's a similar idea). Also the Trinity Test was very underwhelming specially for those familiar with the real footage. Liked exactly like what really was, a good old gasoline movie ""explosion"".



Disagree with the nudity, I'm frankly baffled that's this has become a thing. The nude scene of him deposing, and then having sex in front of his wife was a potent metaphor of how exposed he was at the moment and humiliating this must have been for his wife. The other one with them taking naked also feel like a narrative device to show how comfortable they are with each other.

"Is your IMAX showing it in full 70mm IMAX? If so, definitely Oppenheimer. 

If you have a 70mm (non-IMAX) showing, which is way more common than the 70mm IMAX, that's a perfectly good option too for Oppenheimer. I like the look of the film for this movie, and most of the movie is people talking so it's not like you're missing *too* much without the expanded aspect ratio.

Mission Impossible is great and has way more action, but it doesn't actually use the full IMAX ratio. You're getting 90% of the experience from something like Cinemark XD or Dolby. So while it's still a good movie to watch on a huge IMAX screen, it's not really necessary.",2023-07-21 20:19:40

Finally got around to seeing this movie today and couldn't agree with your assessment more.  Especially the parts about the incredibly fast pacing in the first half of the movie and people not being able to name any characters other than the main three or four.  The movie introduced so many characters in such a short amount of time it was nauseating.  I also found the score constantly playing was definitely distracting.

I watched the movie yesterday and as a European with barely any knowledge on the life of Oppenheimer and/or the surrounding events that proceeded the bombs it definitely was a bit confusing.

It's glossed over mostly,2023-07-21 10:30:54
"I have to disagree with the other person who said it wasn’t handled well. The film makes clear early on that there were many scientists, including some on the project that had serious ethical concerns early on. Oppenheimer eventually shared those concerns. There is a scene showing how the cities were selected that is impactful and emphasizes how trivial some people took the decision. There is a scene where Oppenheimer and other scientists see the consequences (pictures of victims) after the fact, but the viewer doesn’t see the gore. Much of the second half of the film is Oppenheimer dealing with the guilt of his actions.

"Ok rant time because this movie gets way too much hate imo. It’s intentionally confusing and there’s time where the music is mixed up so that the dialogue is unintelligible (also intentional). I saw this in a theater last week and have a decent audio set up at home, and I’ve never had an issue understanding dialogue (except occasional accents). I think a lot of the mixing complaints of Tenet and Oppenheimer mostly come down to the individual theater experience. 

Tenet is also my most rewatched Nolan movie. It took me like 2-3 watches to begin to grasp it though. I was initially just watching it over and over because the backwards footage is so cool looking. He basically just took a cool concept (like the zero g hallway fight in inception) and turned it into the whole movie. While also leaving behind the emotional core a lot of people liked in movies like Inception and Interstellar. Some people couldn’t latch onto a movie that’s almost purely concept while also being so confusing, which I totally understand. 

Big fan. I’d highly recommend it. The set pieces and music are unmatched. Just follow the direction the movie gives in the beginning, “Don’t try to understand it. Feel it.” Just intuit it until you do begin to understand. It might sound like a tall ask but it’s such a rewarding movie with so many great little details.",2023-07-24 17:38:43
"Those were all based on real people. I think it demonstrated how lost in the mess Oppenheimer was. He had the military, the government, his fellow scientists, multiple love interests, and people out to get him. So many people to answer to who had their own opinions on what he was doing. His life really was that messy. Toward the end it became clear that the hearing for Strauss happened *after* Oppe's hearing because Rami Malek's character spoke out during Strauss' hearing about his involvement in getting Oppe's security clearance revoked.

It wasn't even about the bomb, really. We watched a scientist who worked in theoretical ideas be pulled into helping the government develop a dangerous weapon. He tries to convince himself it's to stop the Nazis, even though the government can't stop talking about the threat of Communism and the Soviet Union. Then Germany surrenders... why do we still need the bomb? Is Japan still that big a threat? And while trying to smear Oppe's character, they can't stop bringing up his Communist connections. He built the damn bomb they asked for but they can't stop with the Red Scare scrap. They can't seem to grasp the idea that someone might change their mind about the use for a weapon after seeing the damage it is capable of doing. Imagine feeling like you owe it to your country to help them develop this technology, then they run your reputation through a wood chipper afterwards, and you still can't decide whether or not you did the right thing. It's less about the bomb itself and more about the emotional toll and political games.",2023-07-28 17:53:26
"One point the story makes is how all of these impoerant names in Science knew each other socially and professionally. It was a club as well as a rwaearxh project. There were egos and personalities to be managed as well as science and engineering to be achieves. The big names had families and lives outside of their work. Oppenheim missed his brother.  There were young post docs enjoying their youth while doing there part and some of them grew up to become big names themselves. 

Scientists are a tribe as well as a guild. The Q clearance was a union card as well as an access card.

This project created legends, unified Americas researchers and became a model for how the govt can serve as an engine that fosters innovation. Ot also transformed our thinking about the nature of war and the value of peace.

I was disappointed. Not because it was bad, but because it didn't meet the extreme expectations it carries due to its pedigree and being one of the most vital and interesting subjects out there.

As a long time nerd over this stuff, I felt it lacked detail, left out fascinating parts of the actual process of the building of the bomb and reduced it all down to handwavey one liners about physics. Most of the film was centered around this analogy of how much uranium has been refined so far, and then the bowl is full of marbles and the bomb just appears. Not one mention of the demon core and everything they went through and lives lost just handling the material that went into the bomb.

I'm glad people liked it, but you shouldn't discredit peoples opinions as if it's the perfect film for everyone. I'd say it's solid for mainstream audiences but doesn't do the subject justice in the way I expected it would.",2023-07-21 23:25:14

"ngl I think this movie kind of suffers from being paired with barbie and making people walk in with less serious (?) expectations. like for instance, in my theater, the line from Truman about removing Kyoto from the target list as its his vacation destination made me really upset and harrowed me. most people around me audibly smiled and laughed. -> I know it was supposed to be jarring. but to me, the most jarring part was the people around me cracking at it like it was one of the actual intended funny lines. im not really explaining myself well.",2023-07-23 07:03:20
"Boring? Definitely not. However, my knowledge of the subject basically consisted of ""I skimmed the Manhattan Project Wikipedia article at some point"", i.e. pretty damn surface-level. It felt like the writers did basically the same thing. Which is fine, it's not a documentary. But then it's wrapped up in Christopher Nolan's convoluted nonlinear storytelling style, which IMO adds nothing aside from making the movie needlessly confusing.

It was a solid movie but I didn't find it nearly as impactful or moving as those who think it was a masterpiece apparently did. The moral questions around nuclear weapons have been explored in media countless times. The film was oriented around those questions but there wasn't any kink or depth to how they were presented here that was different enough to make me think about or feel anything new.

"> Uniformative.

If you didn't like the movie fine, but *woah*, I'm gonna stop you right here.

As someone who has read multiple books on Oppenheimer, including the one this film is based on, Nolan knocked it out of the park when it came to how events actually played out. He flattens time a bit or will put two ""scenes"" together to save time, but it's honestly probably one of the most historically accurate films I've seen.

If you had to do an essay on American Prometheus and watched only this film, you would absolutely pass.

EDIT: u/notenglishwobbly responded to me and then immediately blocked me for some reason. 

There's *lots* of things Nolan left out of the film - it's a pretty fucking big book. There are a lot of things left out that maybe I would have included (the Oppenheimer's late life visit to the Chevalier's) but other things that I didn't expect him to put in whatsoever (very pleasantly surprised they included Oppie's ask of Haakon to take Peter - though it was only for 2 months and the film made it seem like 2 years).",2023-07-25 17:46:19

"I thought the conflict with Strauss was a very effective way of encapsulating the dominant struggle in Oppenheimer’s post-war life. I found the richness of the film came from seeing the story of Oppenheimer’s rise and his creation of the bomb interwoven with scenes from his later life showing his titanic battles with guilt and his attempts to assuage it by preventing further nuclear escalation. Strauss epitomised the hawkish militaristic pro-escalation faction who set out to destroy Oppenheimer as he fought to resist the development of the h-bomb and the acceleration of the arms race, and the fact that Strauss did ultimately succeed in destroying Oppenheimer’s reputation in his lifetime really worked for me in terms of the tragic themes. I liked how Oppenheimer almost welcomed his destruction and martyrdom at Strauss’s hands as punishment for having built the bomb. So I don’t see how you could say you didn’t care about the Strauss stuff, because the Strauss stuff is just the escalation of Oppenheimer’s own internal conflict which is the heart of the entire film.",2023-07-29 11:31:04

"You say it “biopic’d harder than any biopic since the mid 00s”, but then later question the decision-making surrounding why the film touched on the white men who designed the bomb rather than the Japanese victims? It’s literally a biopic based on a biography… of Oppenheimer. 

Yes, the Manhattan Project is obviously going to be a defining part of his legacy, but it isn’t his whole journey (in his life story). And I’d argue that if you’re looking to see The Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test, and then the bombings in Japan from a more objective perspective, then perhaps you’d prefer a documentary; or at least a movie not literally called Oppenheimer.

Instead,  Nolan chose to show us the project and Trinity Test largely from Oppenheimer’s perspective, and then the very rapid packing-up of his work and subsequent abandonment of him as he began to publicly advocate against the creation of even larger WMDs. I mean, the test was successful, they immediately loaded the bombs up on trucks, waved goodbye to him and then a few short weeks later killed a massive number of people with them. So, to return to the original point in which you said it was “a choice” show it from the pov of the white man, well… yeah. We had seen the rest of it from his perspective, so of course Nolan shows us Oppenheimer’s resulting internal struggle between pride for his work and the terrifying implications about the new world that mankind has just entered.

As for not comparing Hitler and Oppenheimer enough? Oppenheimer was a physicist who helped to design the bomb; Hitler was a politician systematically leading efforts to perform genocide as efficiently as possible… but sure. Let’s pretend these two people are comparable for your sake. Oppenheimer agreed to lead the Manhattan Project to completion because he was sure Heisenberg could allow Hitler the capability of using atomic weapons on many of the Allies. If Hitler is going to have atomic weapons, would it be better or worse for the Allies to also have atomic weapons? 

Finally, the film does use other characters and the kangaroo court proceedings to point out that Oppenheimer did have questionable timing when it came to his moral objections with the project, and acknowledged them in the only way a biopic can: through other people.",2023-08-05 13:46:57

Prestige - bland characters

Dunkirk - punishing historical accuracy

Dark Knight Rises - unintelligible sound mixing, over-bloated soundtrack

Oppenheimer died in the 60s, smack dab in the middle of the Cold War, so he never got to see the dissolution of the USSR and the dramatic cooldown in nuclear tensions that came with that. So he lived the rest of his days with not only the spectre of nuclear war hanging over his head (as it did with everyone else on earth) but also with the guilt and responsibility of being instrumental in its creation. So if we take it as reflecting Oppenheimer's mindset it's his imagination of what his invention could lead to. 

But Nolan is making a comment on the world WE live in as well. The Cold War ended but there are still enough nuclear weapons in the world to end human civilization several times over. Putin and other high level Russian officials have made apocalyptic nuclear threats since the invasion of Ukraine started, for example, so it's something that hangs over OUR heads in 2023 as well.",2023-07-26 19:04:43

"Certainly the contrarian opinion, not in a bad way

I think the question over whether someone should be removed from government due to their political beliefs is an important one. Oppenheimer was tangentially related to the communist movement but it’s clear he was never a solid anything, and certainly at the time hadn’t been in years. It’s definitely a slippery slope, and I think it’s clear that McCarthyism (of which this is an extension) was negative to many peoples lives. 

Plus there’s the element that Strauss wasn’t trying to have Oppy removed out of a genuine fear of his ideological ties, he was playing Machiavellian politics and removing a rival from a position of influence. Nobody cares about his political ties until they could use it to gain something themselves, at which point they all wanted a piece. 


As for the second point I think it’s more complicated. Maybe if anything it suggests that Truman hadn’t faced the weight of the decision to bomb Japan, or the risk that unleashing nuclear weapons on the world posed. 

But I also agree that being weepy about something you e done doesn’t absolve you, and definitely shouldn’t absolve Oppenheimer of his crimes. I’m not entirely sure what I think about it. 

I take it as a cautionary tale about being swept up and used by systems of power that will spit you out when done, and to be careful about contributing to said system.",2023-07-23 23:59:37

"From [Oppenheimer's Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer):

>In June 1942, the U.S. Army established the Manhattan Engineer District to handle its part in the atom bomb project, beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the Office of Scientific Research and Development to the military.[106] In September, Leslie Groves was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project.[107] He selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons laboratory. This choice surprised many, because Oppenheimer had left-wing political views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves was concerned by the fact that Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize and might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists.[108]

> Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a military engineer, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, and engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an ""overweening ambition"" that Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion. Isidor Rabi considered the appointment ""a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius.""

Long story short, Oppy wasn't the smartest guy there, but the breadth of his knowledge of all aspects of the bomb's construction, along with his enthusiasm, made him uniquely suited to run the project.  You could not simply swap him out with ""another scientist"".",2023-07-24 17:19:49

It's strange how antisemitism is a theme in the story and yet it's so blatantly crass with the holy book of Hinduism. Can someone do this with the Quran or Torah? No. Nolan would have had to publicly apologize while being cancelled by the Jewish community. He'd literally have a fatwa issued in his name, a prize on his head if it were the Quran.

That's not necessarily the case. I just arrived home from the cinema and am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and can confidently say this would be this is one of my least favorite movies of his. That's not because I didn't 'get' it. I just found the pacing to be disjointed. 

The three people I went with all checked their phones after the explosion wondering when it would end, due to the lack of enticement. (I've never experienced this in a Nolan film) and don't use the runtime as an excuse because that's been louded in many reviews and by the actors as not being noticeable. 

I found the start to be great like you mentioned, discovering the possibilities of creating the bomb and the science behind it, to moving out into the desert. But once the testing phase is carried out the movie just dries up and there's a 'twist' that is thrown in there for the sake of having one. And is completely unnecessary. I know Nolan likes to have them in there.
But it drags the movie on for another hour. I feel like this movie was just layered to much and didn't keep the viewer engaged enough to go back for previous viewings to catch all the details missed.

"Strauss was an interesting character, or at least he was portrayed to be very interesting.

His self-important, vindictive nature was evident within the movie, but he is also *completely* correct when he blows his lid to his advisors about how Oppenheimer never once admitted regret for Hiroshima and Nagasaki and that it was also *his* own self interest that made him start objecting.",2023-08-02 15:36:14
Isn’t that how Twitter and the internet works? Feels like people always read what I say in the worst possible way online when I was just chatting and they get offended or worse.,2023-07-23 00:29:11

Strauss was angry because he didn't do what he wanted,2023-07-30 11:06:15
"But you can see some nuance - there was a point in time where Oppie refers to him as a ""lowly"" shoe salesman, which offended Strauss, but is also a generally elitist and insensitive thing to say. Other characters also mention Oppie's arrogance, though I don't think it really came across on screen",2023-08-27 23:31:23
I recognized his face but didn’t put a name to it until afterwards. He was really good.,2023-07-22 08:04:43
Nolan movies always make me tear up. It’s the masterclass of his filmmaking,2023-07-23 02:36:28
I thought it was a bit too on the nose to spell it out verbally and then show it.,2023-08-06 04:14:37
I actually thought he was weakest actor in the film. But the film was filled to to the brink with amazing actors in any case,2023-07-25 17:48:40
Huh? Heel turn is a crazy statement IMHO. I wouldn't call it subtle that he was against him for at least half of the RDJ secens.,2023-07-22 23:40:54

I could have done without that character as a whole honestly,2023-07-22 12:17:39
"Yeah he shares the calculations around when he started the project. The scene at the end with Einstein occurs when oppenheimer first meets RDJ at Princeton, which takes place after the bombs are dropped. It’s a flashback scene shown a second time from a different perspective.",2023-07-24 00:35:51
"No it was the first time Strauss and Oppenheimer met, but Oppenheimer and Einstein had known each other for a long time before that. Their line of work meant they were often running into each other, all those guys knew each other.",2023-07-25 22:20:37
i think it's more like his narcissism confusing them shunning him due to his treatment of oppenheimer with oppenheimer turning them against him in order to justify his treatment of oppenheimer to himself and his aides,2023-07-28 07:00:42
There's also the fact that Nolan loves to reuse actors he's worked with before.  That 5 min role might lead to a 2 hour role in a future Nolan movie.,2023-07-21 21:07:40
"I believe actors are honored to be part of these movies. For Scorsese, Anderson, Nolan.",2023-07-23 12:32:18

Because we’re not sure if there’s a threat, it’s that tense inability to discern what to do between fight or flight.

It’s the dead cold smile. Keeping up appearances and being able to say exactly the right thing to convey both security and the potential for great violence. Every question they ask or statement they make is equally sincere and threatening. They have just enough charisma that the one being interrogated, knows they’re in a test of some sort, a test that other more gullible people have clearly fallen for given the characters titles and achievement. And you’ll notice these characters always have a reputation that precedes them.

Just fascinating to watch actors do that.",2023-08-08 21:20:38

Either way, Pash was notified, and came for the meeting the next day to hear it himself. Pash was the head of surveillance for the manhattan project and was intentionally kept away from Oppenheimer prior to this.

Oppenheimer then told as much as he felt he could to Pash but also lied to protect his friend who acted as the intermediary in asking him to share secrets with the Commies and commit treason. that meeting was recorded and was later used against oppenheimer in his security classification hearing at the end of the movie.",2023-07-29 22:16:57

"I mean, when Oppenheimer said he had blood on his hands, he was accusing Truman, who made the decision to use the bomb. I can understand why Truman took offense -- and I understand why people today have a different perspective. 

I think the movie overstated the amount of angst about using the bomb at the time. Maybe the scientific community was worried, but the politicians and military and the vast majority of the public were ecstatic.

Today, far removed from the war, and having seen the arms race that resulted, we have a very different perspective.",2023-08-12 14:43:42

"You don’t get to write your name in the history books by building a bomb and then feeling sorry that it killed people because it was used. 

The creation of the A-Bomb was inevitable, but it’s eventual manifestation doesn’t release one from the responsibility you committed to by participating in the project to bring it into existence. Oppenheimer in principle does not even get the honor of being the „father“ of the ABomb. Others thought of it and far more significant people signed of on its creation. Oppenheimer was a weapon's smith and handed people a bomb who ordered them from him, he was just the person who had been decided upon to lead the group of inventors. History remembers him, because he was charismatic enough to be likeable while also dropping a bit of translated Sanskrit that emphasizes his participation as well as a murder dropping a quote from Bohemian Rapsody. 

If you want to be really cruel to the person that was Oppenheimer, you could judge him by being just another American that killed a great bunch of other people and it hurt his feelings incredibly deep. The only redeeming quality to him was acknowledging that an arms race should be stopped.",2023-07-23 23:28:28

In depicting science and mankind’s greatest disaster, he focused deeply on the psyche at the forefront of it; whose art/science imitated his life. This was magnificent beyond compare.",2023-07-22 09:31:17
Agreed. Driving home I felt like I’d seen a horror film. Plus the brother from Hereditary was in it.,2023-08-02 00:13:49
"It felt weird to me because it seemed to have switched to Kitty’s perspective. 

In the moments before, he was naked because he felt so insecure and unprepared for these invasive questions. 

Then the angle changes and Jean is taunting Kitty by fucking her husband out in the open there. I took it as Kitty’s imagination, and that’s weird because no other part of the film is told from her perspective. 

That’s my issue with the scene and I’m hoping someone can reframe it so I like it better.",2023-07-26 19:16:55
What took me out is you could literally see Cillian was wearing shorts in the shot from the tableside.,2023-07-25 04:35:58
"It was but I thought intentionally so and I enjoyed it for that. It was far from ""sexy"". I think without that then we don't really know how awful it must have been for Kitty. Her sitting there listening to her husband openly talk about sleeping with another woman whilst married, whilst a room full of older men listen. Completely and utterly humiliating and horribly uncomfortable.

I think the way Nolan directed that scene put is in Kitty's shoes far more and really highlighted how horrible that moment was for her, and how Oppenheimer's actions regarding the appeal didn't only affect himself. I think Kitty's defiant answers later on are less impactful if we don't get that visceral display of how uncomfortable the process was for her.",2023-07-26 19:29:31
That's what I had expected Don't Worry Darling would be.,2023-08-11 23:17:21
Nolan tends to bring back actresses. I could see her starring in a future Nolan flick.,2023-07-25 05:23:08
"Nolan literally doesn't know how to write and direct women. It's a recurring problem for him to the point most of his recent movies have a cast of 95% men.

At least with his movie we had Emily Blunt as Kitty, and they easily made his best female character to date. She legit has a shot at the Oscar",2023-08-01 03:38:26

"I felt the exact same. I saw the movie with a friend and after the credits rolled, I was grappling for words and we both were speechless on our way out to the cars. I told her “We gotta dig into this movie later, but right now I feel like I just need to go cry.”",2023-07-22 19:40:54
"My partner and I definitely cried a fair bit at the end and walking home afterwards. Whole time watching there's just this immensity of emotion which is hard to describe.

I think it hit me in a very particular way, since I relate in some ways to portions of Oppenheimer's journey in rarher personal ways. I studied physics and maths, and now I'm finishing my PhD on solar geoengineering; an area that other grad students in the field have likened kinda to working on the Manhattan project (much less intense obviously), but for climate change. 

There's nothing that terrifies me more than the idea of contributing to something I feel and hope will be for the best, but may actually turn out existentially terrible for the planet.",2023-07-22 12:00:34
I did cry. So did multiple people in my showing. That ending just…breaks you.,2023-07-22 03:35:20

That's exactly how I felt! I was full of emotion yet I couldn't articulate where or why I was felling such sadness. I had such an emotional hangover the next day (saw it Sat eve) where my tears spilled, but the weight of the film hasn't left my mind.",2023-08-07 13:23:44
"Apparently Oppenheimer at one point did travel by train, meeting someone who he talked with by a lake, about his concern of igniting the atmosphere. The conversation even had the line of ""better being enslaved by Nazis than destroying humanity"". But it was not with Einstein, it was Arthur Compton.

At least if [this video](https://youtu.be/nD-Dco7xSSU) on the topic is to be believed (I have admittedly not driven into the sources).

I highly suspect the talk at the end about ""a chain reaction"" beyond ""igniting the atmosphere"" was fully made up, but I don't really care. It made one hell of an ending regardless and wonderfully tied together what the movie had set up.",2023-07-24 01:36:14

"Something I agreed with Kitty about and couldn’t quite piece together is why Oppenheimer let them roll over him in the hearing.

All he said when asked was, “I have my reasons”

Why didn’t he fight like Kitty asked him to? There are some times where he gets somewhat stirred, but he mostly takes the blows and lies on the chin and asks, “is anyone going to hear the truth of what’s happening here?” 

If it was me, I’d definitely be emotional and animated if I was faced with lies and slander. Was it really that he wanted to be a martyr out of his guilt?",2023-07-22 19:48:20
"I love that that’s how history will remember her too. She put up with the faults of her husband because she realized it was for the greater good, and then she absolutely slayed it on the metaphorical grand stage during that hearing.

Janet was such a large piece of First Man because it focuses on each of them mourning both individually and as a family. Both performances were stellar though and I think a lot of women who have lost children or have had to suffer for their husband’s success saw a glimpse of their own experiences in them.,2023-07-24 18:43:47
"I think there are valid points to be had that in a 3 hour movie we could’ve had more depth to them sure but I also think Nolan has a lot of respect for both Tatlock and Kitty and he shows them as almost victims of Oppenheimer’s ego and personality and that he doesn’t care for them like he should. 

There’s a great sympathy to their characters. He mourned them as human beings who had so much to give and deserved so much better than Oppenheimer; Tatlock in her death and Kitty in the life she could have lived if her fire and her fight hadn’t been so overshadowed by Oppenheimer. 

Nolan shows the horror of Tatlock’s suicide through the directing and editing of the bathtub flashback whilst he also gives Kitty these moments to say unequivocally what he thinks of Oppenheimer and damn him for how he treats these women. 

“You don’t get to commits the sin and then ask us all to feel sorry for you when there are consequences.”",2023-07-27 01:34:05

I think he is incredibly underrated - he's so identifiable and yet can disappear into a role as long as it's nothing like his typical persona.",2023-07-24 01:07:24
I lol'd when Josh from Drake and Josh had his first line. So unexpected.,2023-07-28 03:16:59
I think it's cause like outside of the Bourne series which came out ages ago he hasn't really played any super defining characters or characters in long running franchises. He's always just like a guy.,2023-07-23 21:36:51
I feel this way about josh peck,2023-07-24 03:24:04

And that’s not a criticism. He always shows up in good movies.",2023-07-26 02:00:06

Except Deadpool 2!,2023-07-22 03:33:07
"> Like every time he's in any scene in any movie by brain won't stop saying ""Hey look it's Matt Damon lol!""

I feel this way about several actors. I think sometimes their 'star' overshadows their acting presence in a way that they're no longer able to truly disappear into a role anymore.",2023-07-22 14:56:36

Same...I thought he was about to sign Jordan or tell Treadstone he's watching them or solve a math problem in angst. His best role ... True Grit.,2023-08-02 04:32:23
I have that problem pretty much with any famous actor. I always convince myself that the role I'm watching is what their life is actually like.,2023-08-20 22:44:47
That's most films tbh. Look at Blunt compared to the real Kitty.,2023-07-23 02:25:53

I also loved how Nolan didn’t even show Casey’s face cause he knew how recognizable his voice is. Second I heard it I said “Casey Affleck” . Love his voice,2023-07-21 13:15:47
"\>> Damon was right: it's the best movie he's ever been in.

RDJ said that, not Damon.",2023-08-21 23:02:41
Yes the scene where he said it was the most important thing in the fucking world should have been put on a gag reel.,2023-07-31 07:10:11
He had retired by then,2023-07-25 13:38:46
For multiple reasons. Alden Ehrinreich’s last line to Strauss was jaw-dropping as well.,2023-07-22 07:53:20
"Or it could be argued that nuclear deterrence did work. For example the USSR at the time had the largest land army in the world, they may have been able to role past Central Europe and maybe onto Western Europe. Nuclear bombs were eventually going to be developed by the most powerful nations. Without seeing the devastating effects it had on Japan, who knows when and where it would’ve eventually been dropped.",2023-07-22 11:07:57
"The bomb would have always existed. The physics didn't change because that particular place and time were where it was first used on humans. Seeing the horror of the bomb when there were only a few in existence and we couldn't destroy the world may be what has so far kept humanity from burning.

If the Soviets and the US had both had time to build hundreds before everyone saw how terrible they were somebody may have decided to use them. We wouldn't be here in that case.",2023-07-23 00:28:47
"We manufactured Purple Hearts before the potential invasion of Japan. We are still using those same Purple Hearts today even after the Korean War, Vietnam, gulf war, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. That should give you some perspective on how deadly that war would have been.",2023-07-22 20:33:26
"Well, the bomb and its threat to the world would've existed regardless. Arguably using the bombs in Japan showcased how powerful and horrible they were, decreasing the risk of nuclear escalation. This is in the movie too, at some point Oppenheimer says that the bomb needs to be used for real at least once so people know its power.",2023-07-27 14:41:52
"They absolutely consider this, because it's one of the primary counter arguments. The counter to that counter is the nuclear bomb was likely to be created anyway because science finds a way. 

Why not then put it in the hands of someone like the United States and its allies and build international treaties and alliances around safeguarding and counter proliferation?

The second half of the 1900s was historically one of the most peaceful periods in history between major nation states. It just happened a sword of Damocles was hanging over humanity with the policy of mutually assured destruction.",2023-07-25 02:05:47
"One thing the movie didn't get into is that Japan was going to surrender soon anyway. They even offered to, but the US didn't like the terms. Then the US set their own terms, Japan agreed, thus surrending, and then the US only enforced the terms Japan had originally set out.

I think Truman hated communism so much he spun the ""Japan will never surrender"" lie to keep the scientists working so that the US would have the bomb first.",2023-07-22 13:35:46
"The chance is smaller because of the atomic bombings of Japan. Nuclear weapons were always going to be made at some point. Imagine if the world had gone into the Korean war with nuclear weapons but no real proof of the devastation they caused. And instead of 2 of them, there were hundreds.",2023-07-27 00:51:10
The lesser or two evils is still evil. A trolley problem with hundreds of thousands on either side is still a mass tragedy the likes humanity should hope to never replicate. Choosing the most violent possible end for hundreds of thousands of confused civilians over giving hundreds of thousands of soldiers the choice to fight or flee is certainly a choice.,2023-08-13 05:18:42
"There is another layer. Those are soldiers dying. They are choosing to fight. But the bombs killed innocent people, children. That makes it much worse. You can’t equate soldiers with them",2023-07-24 22:49:25
Or that Japan would've probably surrendered without the bomb anyway,2023-07-22 16:03:43

"‘I think we did’
In reference to the original question of will we destroy the world - whether the trinity test will result in uncontrolled chain reaction setting the atmosphere on fire.",2023-07-21 13:49:31
"Kinda? At the end of the film it's being used to allude to the idea that the invention and dropping of the bomb by the US lead to a chain reaction of cause and effect that has brought us to where we are today (thousands of nuclear weapons in silos all around the world) and that that chain reaction is still ongoing and may yet lead to the destruction of the world.

Whether that makes it a metaphor or not I'm not sure, but it's certainly not being used in the same sense it was used in the rest of the film.",2023-07-22 20:56:02
"Yep. Originally, they theorized that the bomb would set a literal chain reaction of elements that will set the atmosphere on fire, thus destroying the world

But in the end, Oppie implied that while the literal chain reaction of elements did not occur, the bomb created a chain reaction of events that will ultimately lead to us destroying the world (like the nations racing to make their own super bombs).",2023-07-23 11:35:08
That must have been a hell of a marathon for Murphy. He's in damn near every scene with constant dialogue.,2023-07-26 06:41:01
Literally the thing that I disliked most about the movie.,2023-07-31 11:19:22
Having Rami Malek as the side character everyone brushed off til the end of the movie shows the strength of this casting,2023-07-22 09:12:43
A week late here also. Her flask falls out when she’s upset with oppie after he talked about piggy character in his questioning. Now the affair is officially written down in history. Not something she can pretend to ignore. That wasn’t after her interview.,2023-08-06 13:43:14
Her questioning scene was amazing,2023-07-22 17:55:23
"They tie to the themes of flawed decision-making, guilt, consequences, and responsibility. Emily Blunt's line about not getting to sin and have people for sorry for you is a direct tie to his conversation with Truman where Truman responds the same way to Oppenheimer's feelings of guilt.",2023-07-23 21:06:33

"She may have been killed as Oppenheimer didn’t gave the name and she must have been first on their suspect list, the officer also mentions he had used extensive resources to find who that is.",2023-07-27 20:34:00
"Ooh that makes sense, I thought the hands represented Roberts guilt, that he saw himself killing her in the tub.",2023-07-23 11:54:18
But she left a suicide note? I think it was Oppenheimer symbolically feeling like he did it to her,2023-07-28 07:02:59
We did see a gloved hand. She was prob compromised after he visited her.,2023-07-27 00:26:03
Matt Damon describing how Casey Affleck’s character was a cold killer felt to me like an implication that her death was orchestrated,2023-07-21 19:32:29

MAD only works until it doesn’t. No guarantee that humanity wont destroy itself with nuclear weapons,2023-07-21 04:30:58

"I think the point of that is that watching it today, as a modern audience, it is still something that could be the case. Ever since the arms race began we have had nuclear annihilation hanging over our heads, and it's not a totally wild position to believe that it *will* happen at some point, even if that's not soon. MAD isn't really super  relevant, that effects the probability only.",2023-07-22 00:51:28

There was a non zero chance detonateing the bomb would cause a chain reaction igniteing the atmosphere and ending the world so when he says detonateing the bomb csused a chain reaction that would end the world hes talking about the cold war.,2023-07-21 09:13:50

Ludwig has incredible range. He really complements the directors’ visions well.,2023-07-24 12:18:28

"Of all the currently acclaimed film composers, his score for Oppenheimer is definitely closest to Zimmer, people often “criticize” or describe his work as much more flat, long and sound-designy compared to other composers. I’m not saying this, just saying Zimmer is described this way often. Long, heavy notes. His score is just as hummable.",2023-07-22 04:49:32
Black Panther and Mandalorian's themes would both fit that category,2023-07-22 12:43:44
"You completely nailed it. Goransson to ME is very different from Zimmer. That difference is songs that become such earworms that by the end of the movie it’s what you associate almost the most with! With all of the movies score by Hans if you just gave me the title of the movie I with confidence could hum a tune, even if it’s been years since my last view. 

Goransson adds the the movie, creates great tone, but I’ve yet to see that Zimmer moment with his Nolan movies. Mando and Creed films are a completely different story. Which makes me wonder if Nolan has wanted to change how scores fit into his movies.",2023-07-29 00:42:23
I love Ludwig’s work and he has made many Hans-level themes but I agree with you in regards to his Nolan work. The score is great but Tenet and Oppenheimer don’t have any memorable themes like Interstellar/Inception/TDK do which is a bummer.,2023-07-22 13:19:20
"agreed. Parts of it were really good,  but the music led the viewer a little too much for my liking emotionally.",2023-07-24 01:32:15
"Yep, I consciously noticed the score too much. For me that isn't a good sign.",2023-07-25 05:50:09
Thank you! I’m reading these comments in disbelief. It was so distracting at times. Like trust in the actors ability to deliver the lines without the Nolan suspense music pulsing.,2023-07-24 06:41:32
Great for a movie like Tenant. Absolutely unnecessary for this style of film.,2023-07-29 00:47:27

"Zimmer was probably working for dune 2, plus ludwig did such a good job for tenet it would be a shame to not have him score Oppenheimer as well",2023-07-23 23:00:36
How'd the figure that out?,2023-07-25 04:39:05
"I think the footage at the beginning of the movie may have been from an actual nuclear test, or at least something rendered from one. It looks a lot like some of the videos of megaton yield fusion bombs and those are a lot scarier looking than the early devices.",2023-07-22 03:20:06
Interesting. I fucking felt it. It almost made me cry seeing how intense and white the fire was knowing that after that they still dropped it on cities of people. The slow mo as it pans up and you see all the layers was absolutely jaw dropping for me.,2023-07-23 14:48:23
"I think what Nolan did was far more effective and greater act of cinema. 

We are focalizing from Oppenheimer and the rest, they felt anxious up to the bombing (so did we) but they were in awe when they saw the bomb from that distance (as did we) 

It was fantastic way to pull us into the minds of the characters and their perspective. Damn shame it didn’t work for you",2023-07-21 21:57:41
Guessing you didn't get IMAX,2023-08-14 00:03:02
I feel like the movie was just lacking some scale. In truth the explosion was massive but from 5 miles away in a flat desert it’s not going to look like that. If we could see the fireball next to an object on the ground it would make a difference. But also the trinity test was quite small compared to later bombs and if course the hydrogen bombs.,2023-07-23 07:06:32
"I think Nolan went for how it would feel to be at the test site, not how some imaginary version would be portrayed.

Also the footage we have is taken closer to the explosion than where Oppenheimer was, and he was 5 miles away.

The scale and impact was taken from witness reports.",2023-07-21 10:45:59
"I don't know anything about twin peaks, why the fuck is there a bomb test haha.

Don't spoil it pls, I'll get to watch it, eventually...",2023-07-21 23:56:32

Isn’t he the one who was sitting in the car saying the glass protects against UV?,2023-07-25 23:42:40
"Feynman, arguably one of the greatest American physicists, was known to be quite a character. He had a very large personality not only among people in general, but especially among physicists who tend to be more reserved leading him to stand out. There are many really funny stories about him. A classic one being that he was notorious for having a set of bongos lying around and would play them frequently. In the movie, it’s funny how he barely had any dialogue but had a presence in the background of many scenes, often with his bongos (see the video linked below of him playing).

https://youtu.be/qWabhnt91Uc",2023-07-21 15:04:35
"If you read his books, i forget which, he talks about how he didn't want to just be a physicist.  So he taught himself to be charming to hit on women, dance, play instruments (bongos) and paint.  When he was in las alamos he got in trouble a lot fucking with everyone and picking (where he taught himself that, too) classified cabinets and safes. Honestly Nolan should do a movie about him because he's just as important as Oppybombs.",2023-07-24 00:07:50
"Yeah, but Feynman was decent at the bongos. Quaid seemed like he’d just picked them up for the first time the day they shot that scene.",2023-07-26 09:38:51
I was thinking this too! I knew he was Feinman but I couldn’t help but see Boimler playing the bongos lol,2023-07-27 22:53:19
"Oh I think it totally works thematically and how the characters got there. 

But if we knew he literally calls himself the destroyer of worlds in the scene everyone was memeing he would hang dong in, the internet would’ve went *wild*.",2023-07-21 03:38:53
"Didn’t see this in the moment but it tracks

Good point",2023-07-21 04:56:41
"She was murdered in the film, right? In the scene showing her suicide, while it was only a single shot that was maybe a second long, I believe I saw a hand wearing a black glove behind her head.",2023-07-22 01:57:39
I just am not sure it’s really true to character or understanding to have him read religious Hindu scripture during a sex scene. My understanding is that oppenheimer had a lot of respect for Hindu scripture,2023-07-21 06:14:33
Thank you! And she was also his undoing in a way.,2023-07-22 18:53:28

Same in India! They covered her in a black dress and cropped the shots during the love scenes.,2023-07-22 11:13:45
"That's amazing, Nolan *lied* about the CGI. Did the audience laugh?",2023-07-21 20:37:36
they cut the whole section here in nepal. Fucking prudish morality police.,2023-07-22 06:10:11
WHAT. That's fucking absurd lol.,2023-07-23 00:29:19

In india too lol. But it was fine. I don’t know why she would’ve had to be nude for that.,2023-07-25 19:14:30
Same here in Indonesia,2023-07-23 02:51:26
Yes same here in South East Asia,2023-07-23 19:15:36

Apparently she loves being naked. She even signed a contract that forced them to show her naked for at least 15 seconds",2023-07-21 19:34:04
It hit different though after she killed herself and it affected him greatly being ‘death’ and the ‘destroyer’ of Jean’s world,2023-07-21 15:57:23
I think it was a great swerve from what people expected.,2023-07-22 13:37:40
agreed. I feel there was a bit of studio hand in many scenes that being one of them. It felt soapy for the purpose of making the movie more approachable for the masses.,2023-07-21 16:03:31
I thought Kitty was handled quite well.,2023-07-24 02:57:00

He handled it in a wink wink way for sure, honestly this film’s portrayal of the US government was for sure not positive anyhow though not to conspiracy levels.",2023-07-22 18:45:06
That sounds like a great analysis tbh. I haven’t even thought of looking at it that way!,2023-07-24 02:30:59
"Other way around. The ""a bomb"" is a fission bomb. The ""h bomb"" is a fusion bomb.

That being said, I had the same question about why they did the 1/2 numbering thing and your explanation is helpful.",2023-07-22 03:08:00
other way around,2023-07-22 03:03:16
"fission was a bomb color, fusion was h bomb black and white",2023-07-22 03:04:07
"I thought it had something to do with Oppenheimer was fine with the A bomb since it was to help stop the nazis, but the H Bomb was when he was against with what was happening helping illustrate the 2 storylines.

But i also feel like maybe that is not a strong enough connection and maybe there’s a better explanation out there",2023-07-22 02:45:17
Wondered what the fission bit was about and yeah I also missed the fusion part. Not that I would have understood what it meant anyway lol,2023-09-06 17:10:52

"If you read first hand reports from survivors in Japan, that was exactly what happened, a silent expolosion. My girlfriend held my hand in expectation of a big bang at that point, but knew it was gonna play out in silence.",2023-07-21 22:44:45
Nolan used that bit in the Interstellar docking scene too and it was also extremely effective,2023-07-22 23:53:24
"Yeah everyone expected the bomb to make a big bang, and then you're like ""Oh right, it takes time for sound to travel that far"".",2023-07-21 13:08:28
The whole movie was blasting soundtracks almost from start to finish.,2023-07-21 15:32:58
dont forget how it was silence with slow panting. truly chilling,2023-07-24 23:18:20
"god you're a dumbass lol, go study some physics kiddo, speed of sound does not equal speed of light",2023-08-01 22:14:02
It was not an artistic decision. That is how it is in real life,2023-08-03 00:31:33
"I was fucking HORRIFIED in the theater at this. My god. What a classic scene. I started getting this random, insane creeping dread when the countdown started when I realized that I absolutely did not want to see this happen, even though I knew it was a test and not even the devastating event that follows in history. I plugged my ears and opened them repeatedly in the last 30 seconds, not sure if I wanted to brave it. I kept my ears unplugged and was shocked to hear nothing",2023-07-23 02:55:09
"It would have been in silence. 

They were in a desert and sound travels slower than light. 

Your comment does not deserve 30 upvotes and you are likely a studio shill.",2023-07-21 04:58:45
Me too. That’s what I really like about that scene.,2023-07-22 23:12:54
Followed by only the sound of breathing. Very well done.,2023-08-09 04:06:09
"Seeing in it in 70mm IMAX was totally worth it and immersive visually, aurally and tactilely.  When the sound of the blast finally kicked it, not only was it overwhelmingly loud, but the violent shaking could be felt.  It was as if Nolan made a 4D movie but without the cheesy rumble seats.",2023-08-14 16:54:24
"Nolan was getting slick with this because yeah in retrospect, it makes total sense why he chose to drown out any sounds because any bomb that goes off is automatically loud that's a given. Nolan just needed the visuals to depict one of the greatest powers ever invented by man, just the sheer power of it and its terrifying implications. Just a brilliant scene all in all.",2023-11-15 08:28:18
"We could hear the film rolling with how quiet the audience was during this scene, absolutely amazing",2023-07-22 12:04:57
Just came out of a 70mm screening. The movie is absolutely beautiful.,2023-07-21 05:26:18

edit: once the explosion sound hit i jumped in my seat. i was expecting it, but i didn’t expect it",2023-07-25 03:04:58

Watching this shows me just how much Cillian encapsulated the real Oppenheimer.,2023-07-22 00:56:38
"This famous footage was from an NBC interview taken in 1965, two years before his death.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm ordered that the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance be vacated *on December 16, 2022*. According to her order, the Atomic Energy Commission failed to follow its own rules and those failures were material to the fairness of the proceeding.",2023-07-23 23:23:20

I’m pretty sure they gave his words to a different guy in the bunker because if I remember the only thing he actually said after the bomb went off was just “it worked”.,2023-07-30 07:25:46
"what a pretentious cunt, really",2023-07-21 04:14:54
I honestly thought it was my friend breathing cause of how quiet it was.,2023-07-21 03:49:32

"Yes. 
The scene is dead silent and visually stunning but it’s let up to in such a brilliant way (in part through the audio score) that the entire theatre was in tense silent anticipation, my companion keep edging forward until they were on the literal edge of their seat.",2023-07-21 04:50:25
"Thankful that mine was the same. I did hear a few gasps though, which was cool. Love cinema.",2023-07-23 02:54:01

"Paid £12 for a big screen showing when a standard showing would cost £5… and the people right next to me talked all the way through it (including going “boom” during the bomb silence).

Yup!,2023-07-22 03:22:07
"I thought I was going crazy!  Major flicker at our 70mm screening.  I got used to it mostly, but not entirely, and it distracted me off and on the whole film.

Honestly, I couldn't tell it was 70mm.  There are no true IMAX screens in my state, so I thought 70mm would be the next best thing, but it didn't seem much different than anything else, imo.",2023-07-30 21:15:41
I heard this happened in NY.,2023-07-30 05:07:02
"I think that was done on purpose

"Did the same lol. Surprised that was the trailer they decided to pay right before the movie, once everyone is sitting down ready for the movie",2023-07-23 07:21:09
Yeah in my opinion I wish they'd keep horror movie trailers out of movies like this.  I don't like horror movies and don't like jump scares so  I really don't like seeing that stuff especially at such a high intensity.  Like damn man,2023-07-21 06:05:11
Lol my wife did the same. She is VERY close to being due with our first kid and she already hates horror movies so seeing the kids go missing then become satanfied did not make her happy,2023-07-26 04:01:29

"Yep. No idea why you're being downvoted when you are absolutely correct.


Robert Downey Jr. did a fantastic playing a character that has pretty much nothing to do with the most important part of the film. The entire story arc was a footnote in the life of Oppenheimer, who will be remembered forever solely for creating the atomic bomb.",2023-07-22 22:03:49

It didn’t help the AC was out in my theatre, but I think I would appreciate the movie much more in a second viewing. But I don’t know when I’d be ready to dive into a movie like that again.",2023-07-22 04:09:26
"Definitely fooled me. I was expecting it to be a lot faster paced and more “action” but what we got is miles better than that.

"As someone who loves movies and the communal experience of watching a great movie in a theater, yeah, it was emotional. Especially while watching a movie that on paper would not draw that kind of crowd. I fully believe that this movie alone is going to open so many eyes to wide swaths of cinema that are rarely looked at by the general public. And I’ll give it to you, the theater experience has MASSIVELY declined these past few years. Run by corporations that couldn’t give two shits about cinema as long as it makes them money. Leading to crowded and dirty lobbies, out of focus projectors, broken speakers, and ungodly amounts of ads and trailers. We have also become an extremely selfish culture leading to any number of rude behaviors by other patrons. But by some miracle, on Thursday night I experienced almost none of that. And on top of it the movie we were watching was unlike anything else that typically would pack a theater like that. So yes, I felt deep emotions and I’m not ashamed of it. Cheers.

Edit: downvote but no rebuttal. Classy.",2023-07-22 20:31:32
What’s baffling though is how low Oppenheimer’s budget is compared to most Hollywood movies. He literally made it for 100 mil versus something like Quantumania that was 200 mil. Or The Flash which was 220 mil. Or Fast X which was a mind numbing 340 mil. And all of those bombed big time. So in actuality he’s working with a much lower budget than many other less established directors. And I know those are all sequels but they are sucking up the dollars studios can spend. I hope studios learn from this and start seriously looking at these absurd budgets they’ve been handing out like candy for projects that don’t require or even deserve that kind of money.,2023-07-24 19:19:36
I definitely think it’s that caliber of a film even if I can’t say the same. As a film fan though I’m very interested to know what it knocked off the perch of number one for you.,2023-07-24 19:25:26

It's my one complaint with the movie -- we know developing the bomb was this near impossible task, and we know they were racing against the Germans to get it done, but we never really are shown much about the actual discoveries at Los Alamos that got it there. So the whole thing felt more inevitable in the movie than it probably did in real life.",2023-07-21 20:33:44
That and the slow construction of the demon core and the last part being put on mere hours before testing was so good.,2023-07-21 17:30:34
I liked that they changed size/intensity depending on the moment. Just really basic but brilliant movie making,2023-07-21 12:11:24
I feel like it’s also meant to serve as visualization of Oppenheimer trying to understand the wavelike form of particles. Note that much of quantum physics (or at least one branch of it that I’ve learned of) is based on crystallography and I suspect the scene where he was breaking glasses and listening to the smashing was him trying to gain some knowledge of the release of energy by listening to the sound. It’s why in the scene directly preceding the glass smashing Oppenheimer gets asked if he hears the music.,2023-07-21 22:22:06

There’s a scene in Los Alamos where these little things on the window Oppenheimer is looking through have a mushroom shape. Another scene has curtains in the window in front of the sink where Oppenheimer is washing his hands/dishes, the plant design looks like a mushroom cloud.

"I’m missing a couple of Nolan films in my repertoire, but I feel like this is the only time I’ve seen him use purely emotion to inform heightened reality. Like there have been some trippy scenes in the past, but there’s always an in-world explanation (space-time wormhole, drugs, dreams). Otherwise it’s more straightforward

So many scenes in the back half of this one have these effects that are based in the emotions of the protagonist, his anxiety, his guilt. I think it was extremely effective",2023-07-22 06:54:49
"He kept staving off the guilt until that moment. He knew the bomb wasn’t necessary to end the war, but he kept telling himself that it was necessary to let the public know what power it wielded. He couldn’t keep lying to himself during the speech. His ego abandoned him.",2023-07-22 07:53:14

Then of course he tries to fight against it and never really gets far.",2023-07-22 13:00:54

"I think it has to do with Einstein being one of the few widely recognizable people that the movie shows. Not a lot of famous movies or shows portraying Einstein so despite his being a household name we don’t have a saturation of Einstein performances. So when he appears on screen it gave the same feeling as seeing a crossover superhero movie. 

I think the other really famous person depicted was Harry Truman but that’s about it. The rest are somewhat known in academic/historical circles but you go to any random household in America and they won’t know majority of the real life people being portrayed.",2023-07-21 07:49:34

The final images is no longer the world being destroyed by a burning atmosphere but devastated by nuclear missiles. So the bomb did started a chain reaction.,2023-07-21 05:51:45
"Actual answer? Hyperbole can be useful to convey emotion, to convey the context and depths of a given statement, to emphasize a given point. 

It’s not meant to be taken literally, like OP isn’t literally going to have a ghost going around him going “OooOoooOo that scene in Nolan’s 2023 film Oppenheimer OoOoOooOooooOoOo” 

It means that OP is going to think about the scene, it’s meanings and the themes of death, destruction, ego, and humankind’s innate ability to kill… for a long time.

"Basically that Oppenheimer and atomic science really did start a chain reaction of destruction: not a literal burning of the atmosphere, but the nuclear arms race that defined politics for the rest of the Cold War and beyond.

I also think because WW2 quite literally was a sliding doors type moment. The world would be fundamentally different if the Nazis or the Soviets got the bombs first.

In terms of physics, we’ve also had the discovery of various new subatomic particles like the higgs boson, the first observation of gravitational waves, the recent nobel prize about the universe not being locally “real”.

Science is everywhere, and as a result, many people are deadened to the wonder of such discoveries. Science is also much more widespread, not confined to an exclusive group of (largely) white male geniuses who then become celebrity because pop stars don’t yet exist.",2023-07-31 20:10:02

The fact that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both got authorized around the same time means that it's hard to point to a single scientist responsible for the vaccine.

"That's putting it lightly. Truman called Oppenheimer a pussy who he never wanted to hear from again, lol.",2023-07-21 03:37:33

Well this is the whole thing I struggle with as a historian. I think it was the best option to drop the bombs. It was also horrible. Did Truman truly feel guilt? Did oppenheimer? Or were they both such megalomaniacs that they felt they had to feel bad but didn't actually.  We can never be sure.,2023-07-21 03:13:30

I think what's amazing about the movie is how it discusses theory versus reality. I'm a history teacher and I talk to my students about theory all the time. But people can be wicked (like hitler). Scientists and historians and theorists in general simply don't know how to deal with these people. Of course we don't want to destroy our species.

I agree. He would be surprised that we have survived this long with the bomb. It does make one wonder if we can survive long enough to make it to a future were atomic weapons Can't destroy us bc were too spread out. That's the hope and for me its where I think nuclear energy will eventually lead but we just don't know.,2023-07-25 02:14:08

"One great one is The Making of the Aromic Bomb by Richard Rhodes. It won a Pulitzer and its 800 pages but it feels like historical fiction. He starts by discussing the discover of the atom, then the atomic atom, Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, Lawrence's atomic collisions, and keeps going. It covers some 75 years of physics and chemistry before it even gets to the bomb. It's an amazing book. 

Hiroshima by John Hersey talks about Hiroshima and its bombing from the perspective of survivors. 

It's not a book but if you're an audio fan I'd recommend Dan Carlins hard-core history blitz called ""destroyer of worlds."" It comes with a million book recommendations and it discusses the years after ww2 and why this stuff is so complicated and what it was like to be alive in those years which does a lot to explain why the bombs were so terrifying and why America felt it had to use them. 

I'd also recommend Downfall by Richard B Frank which shows Japan was not going to surrender and how the bombs were morally horrible but necessary in a war like that. 

Personally I think Americans should come away from all this recognizing yes we did it, yes we should feel bad, yes Japan in that era had to bestopped, and no, there were no options that would have led to an outcome with few more deaths, and yes we spent the Cold War trying to ensure the bombs were never used again, both for selfish and unselfish reasons.",2023-07-24 01:07:31
"I'd also infer this thread on Twitter by someone who put together a historiography of thre various books that have argued different perspectives on using the bomb.

I do think they serve a purpose. It highlights just how much of a frontier of science they were on. Particularly the use of Einstein (the one guy everyone in the theater will know). At one point Oppenheimer is asked why Einstein wasn’t part of the project. He responds something like his ideas were outdated. The basic message being the universally know smartest guy to ever live didn’t understand what these guys were doing. I think as you go down the list there are probably some people included just as a bit of an Easter egg to the bigger nerds in the audience. And lastly they are included because they were actually there. These guys have Nobel prizes for a reason and the Manhattan project did assemble the smartest if’s they had access to at the time.,2023-07-23 03:06:42

"I do get what you’re saying but in that scene he IS seeing the outcome, and I’m not sure if it would’ve been more powerful to show at least a glimpse of that as well. You shouldn’t need to pander and show the guts to get across that nuclear bombs have a bad outcome but I do wonder if people have perhaps forgotten (if they ever really processed it to begin with).

"Seemed pretty clear to me dude. The story is almost ‘narrated’ from the ‘definitely not a trial’ by Oppenheimer and RDJ in his similar situation. The movie distinguishes this by using the black and white scenes for the recollections of Strauss (RDJ), and the colour scenes for Oppenheimer. It doesn’t need to be directly stated to you for this to be obvious. To call this “all over the place” is straight up lunacy, each placement of the RDJ scenes against the Oppenheimer scenes were absolutely purposeful and worked to compliment each other perfectly. 

Even the first act, where the movie moves at lightning pace, jumping from one scene to the next without giving you a chance to rest or even contemplate what you just saw, is all by design. These scenes are being told by Oppenheimer, while he is sat in that conference room watching these people tear down his character and credibility at that same lightning pace that the movie drags you through with. 

If you are by chance referring to the dialogue when  you say you were confused, this is somewhat be design to. There are plenty of times where the dialogue is difficult to make out, I point again to the first act, but this is done for the same reason as I said in my last paragraph. You’d notice that when the dialogue is really imperative to understanding a scene, it is much easier to hear it. In all the most important moments, the film slows itself down to allow you to soak it in, before accelerating again to the blinding pace Oppenheimer’s very life is changing. 

So, you may be confused because the movie wanted you to be, or, you could have just not paid enough attention to it. It was definitely not all over the place, this movie without a doubt, is a cinematic masterpiece.",2023-07-21 20:05:55
How can you get confused by this?,2023-07-21 20:27:33

As to your last point, I think you're right, I only wish you were more right. I myself am not Jewish, but I wish there was more to fight for the marginalised and oppressed, whoever they may be.

edit: I also want to thank you for providing more context to my remarks about the Bhagavad-Gita. If you would be so kind as to teach me more, I'm all ears.

The movie does a great job covering Oppenheimer’s life but barely touches on the other incredible stories surrounding the the actual bomb program.  Fermi probably gets the shortest straw of the film, relegated to a single scene and an offhand “well I guess you did it”.

In reality Chicago Pile #1 was the greatest science experiment ever conducted up to that time, and Fermi did it with college kids and almost no resources.  After he built that he went to Hanford and ran the Plutonium separation team which was an incredible accomplishment.  They build a factory to separate kilograms of plutonium at a time when separating plutonium had only been done in a lab and in Micrograms.  The factory was entirely built to be remotely operated and it worked.

There we’re probably only two people who could have run the Bomb program other than Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence and Enrico Fermi.",2023-07-24 01:25:51

To the point, they even removed the team that helped Hawking come up with Hawking Radiation. They changed it so he was looking into a fire and had a eureka! moment, which was definitely not how it happened. 

If they were to make a parallel attempt in this film, it wouldn't be about the Manhattan Project but instead about his leading the team who explored the idea of a ""dark star"" aka a black hole. As we saw this took up maybe 3 minutes of runtime in this movie, so to extrapolate on that would be really tiresome.  Now consider doing that with all the concepts that were introduced throughout the film: dark stars, splitting the atom, superpositions, collision cascades, etc. I just don't think you can do that successfully in this film that already spends the first 2 hours running full speed through the story.",2023-08-02 14:11:44

But still he gloats about getting credit for the mass killing of civilians and is confident the Russians won't be able to build a bomb at any point.

If I recall correctly it was mostly done on frames and scenes with Oppenheimer and Strauss.",2023-07-24 21:18:12
Do you think the general audience would come anywhere close to understanding how an a-bomb is made in 3 hours?,2023-07-24 19:46:06
"The basic principles of how the original A-Bombs worked is both very public, and not particularly difficult to understand.

Fission reactions work when you have a mass of fissile material of sufficient mass and density to start a chain reaction; this is called a critical mass.  (This is what they did under the bleachers in Chicago.)  If go from sub-critical, to well-beyond-critical, very quickly, you've made a fission bomb.  (If you do it very slowly, in a controlled fashion, you have a nuclear reactor.  If you do it slowly, but in an uncontrolled fashion, you have a nuclear meltdown.)

Liitle boy (the Hiroshima weapon) worked by firing using a single-use cannon to fire a slug of U-235 fired into the side of a sphere of U-235 with a hole in it for the slug; the completed sphere being a critical mass, while each separate part is (relatively) inert. Fat Man (the style of weapon used for the Trinity test) used shaped charges to implode a sphere of plutonium so it is of sufficient density to start an explosive chain reaction.

There, you now know how to create a Fission bomb.  I haven't told you anything classified, or indeed anything not routinely taught in undergrad-level physics classes, or detailed in books and articles about the Manhattan project.  Of course, you can't actually build anything based on a few paragraphs, because there's a lot of complicated math to actually build something that will explode when you want it to, and not turn your bomb factory into a pile of glowing slag.

The thing is, explaining basic principles is simple enough, but it triggers a lot of other questions with a general audience... what's Plutonium?  what's uranium?  why is a chain reaction important?  what exactly is reacting here?  And really, in the end, the science isn't really that important to the story; it's a biopic, not the history of atomic energy (which would have encompassed a lot more people, and many more decades, than would fit in a 3-hour movie.)

If you'd like to know more, I can highly recommend the book ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" by Richard Rhodes; it's my single favorite non-fiction book.",2023-07-24 20:26:23
"Yeah, the trailer was very misleading then. Also in filmmaking there is a a common saying, ""what is the most interesting moment of a character's life and why aren't you showing the audience that?"" Strauss was not the most interesting element of his story. It should have been relegated to a side element.",2023-07-24 20:21:26
"More explosions, no. To do the film's single explosion – one that was built up over the source of 2+ hours – justice? That would have been nice.",2023-07-24 20:53:25
"If you have a story about a man with two conflicts, one about a personal quarrel and one that literally changed the world forever, why would you focus on the less important conflict?",2023-07-24 21:50:34
The film isn’t primarily about the atomic bomb. It’s about Oppenheimer. I think that’s what people are forgetting. Strauss was the man who used Oppenheimer’s guilt to destroy his reputation while simultaneously destroying his own. It’s a symbolic mutually assured destruction scenario. His part in the movie is to play apart of the eternal torment granted to the American Prometheus,2023-07-23 06:16:57
"The book the film is based on has three parts: how Oppenheimer became Oppenheimer the brilliant scientist, Oppenheimer and The Manhattan Project, and Strauss' confirmation hearing.

Strauss v Oppenheimer mirrors Oppenheimer's worst fear of ever-increasing escalation of might and the Strauss confirmation hearings were a big moment for the cultural understanding of Oppenheimer given some distance from the war.",2023-07-23 06:16:22

"Doubtful, as you get a digital feed from the cameras too. The out of focus shots were strange, there was no obvious artistic merit to justify it. They were using a very narrow depth of field, and I guess the sheer amount of shots meant a few clangers slipped through.",2023-07-26 05:19:47
"They do many takes, and the focus pullers can never be 100% accurate on all of them, especially with actors moving back and forth. Between a perfectly focused take and a perfectly executed acting performance, editors would usually go with the latter.",2023-07-26 06:04:40

"also b/c every person who died invading/blockading Japan could be saved, and that's 20K (or more) letters that won't have to be sent to grieving parents.  

Also: if they waited a few more weeks, Russia was obliged to enter the Pacific Theater to help us, and they would have lost even more people in the effort.",2023-07-29 18:50:24
"You do realize the die-hards launched an actual coup attempt to stop the surrender? There were soldiers running around the Japanese Imperial palace trying to find the surrender recording so they could destroy it.


The Japanese were not going to surrender. It was atomic bombs, a genocidal starvation, or an invasion with tens of millions dead.

And the Russians declaring war was more the Japanese loosing the last chance of a mediator than an actual military threat.",2023-07-30 03:12:37
Exactly. Agree 100%. I hate studios as much as the next movie fan but Nolan having final cut left too much unnecessary filler the last hour,2023-07-21 20:41:09

"I can usually get past Nolan's poor sound mixing since his other recent movies were more action/set piece heavy, but this was a character drama with tons of important dialogue, and I couldn't hear about 20% of it so the non-linear plot was a struggle to follow.

You don't have to be demeaning with the claim that people just wanted kabooms. C'mon. The 3rd act was painfully monotonous and not set up enough to make us care about Strauss at all. It could have been cut down to a half hour at least but it wasn't sadly. It definitely brought the film down for many.,2023-07-22 20:14:43

"I mean granted at the time Feynman himself said he was doing grunt work for other scientists (and for a movie about Oppenheimer they generously also showed his classic bongo drumming and also him not using eye protection and instead looking through a glass car window)

Fermi and his work during the time was mentioned and shown a few times

The big wig of the era was the likes of Bohr 

At the end of the day the movie isnt “The Manhattan Project” or “Scientists who changed the 20th century”, rather a character study of Oppenheimer (including the people be interacted with or managed during the Manhattan Project, however all revolving around Oppenheimer). The biography its based off is similar - its a biography of the man, his controversies, his views and regrets, not of the Atomic Age. There’s other books for that",2023-07-29 04:29:57
...well the movie's about Oppenheimer. Feynman could have a show all to himself (and in fact did produce a lot of interesting shows he hosted),2023-07-29 07:26:23
"They shouldn't have shown that, I almost cried during the testing. Showing a literal tragedy on screen would've been disrespectful.",2023-07-22 02:59:27
"Critiquing the lack of clarity as to why Oppie decides to suddenly tie his life to this woman and she to him, and the lack of on-screen justification for him being labeled a womanizer are direct critiques of the screenwriting that are perfectly reasonable specifically because this is based on a true story, not the other way around.

Critiquing the explosion after the amount of build up around it from the marketing and the movie itself is a perfectly reasonable critique and ""hurr durr sorry he couldn't blow up an actual nuclear bomb"" is a ludicrous strawman that couldn't even be called a counterargument as a joke.

\>Your negatives concern me, friendo. You need to re-tune your ""critique"" brain a bit.

Pay more attention to the movie",2023-07-23 21:54:47
"I think the issue with the focus on the security clearance was it never really focused on why it was so important. The film literally jumped from Trinity, to the tail end of the questioning. We never got much scenes, if at all, in between the 2 events of what Oppie would use his clearance for. And the little we got, it was sprinkled in between with non-linear story telling, and with how fast paced the film is, it's easy to miss a ton of info like that.",2023-07-24 18:31:47

If they didn't drop the bombs, the Americans expected that the war would continue into the spring of the following year and they would lose more than a million troops.

This does not justify either bomb, just explaining why 2 bombs were dropped.",2023-08-08 01:51:32

Pretty much none of this is accurate. There's a Wikipedia page that goes into more detail. Both of them had legitimate targets for war, visibility, etc. They had no intention of dropping a nuke on the Emperor, which proved prescient as it was necessary for him to quit RPing a member of the House of Windsor long enough to push the war council from voting to continue the war after the 2nd bombing.",2023-07-23 13:58:33

He didn't want ethical stain but thought he was doing the right thing only to end up with ethical stain at the end nonetheless. His opinion is asked again and again by scientists, friends and his wife about what he feels but he keeps avoiding stating it for the ""right thing"".

Feynman was present at the first detonation of an atomic bomb. The achievement excited him at first, but he ultimately expressed concerns about the implications of the technology.

"For sure! That is what I was referring to with ""subtle references"". They do some smaller artistic nods towards the horror of it, like at the gymnasium.

And there were so many other good stories to tell. Maybe give Feynman more room, or tell more about the war. Or about other things in his life.

"I mean, I don’t really know how to respond to that other than you’re just all around incorrect. People complain about the character study cop out when they WISH what they were watching was narrative driven instead of the narrative being a framework for character exploration. 

Succession may be the worst example you could give because that’s another piece of media that is, at its core, a character study. Yeah the business dealings and moves and drama were there and interesting, but at its heart they only existed to serve the primary purpose of the show which was to explore the Roys as people and as a family. I promise you that if you could be a fly on the wall of the writer’s room, nobody actually gave a shit about the business minutia of the Gojo deal. They only cared about it as far as it let them explore the nature of the characters. Listen to literally any interview with any of the show creators/runners if you think I’m wrong. 

Same is true for Oppenheimer. “Make no mistake this was a narrative driven movie.” Based on what? Your own expectations? Because it worked beautifully as a character study. Maybe it, in your eyes, failed as a narrative driven movie because that isn’t what it was intended to be and you viewed it through the lens of your own anticipation.",2023-07-28 05:28:41

For example 12 angry man sidney lumet such a class movie dialog drive smart and sharp but also deep dialog s its serves well .the movie nature explains in the  start and the viewer into   that naturally also feels like real peoples .

schindler's list - drama that uses all area of its genre each interactions feels like natural

For oppenheimer - drama section turn into thriller  fast paced no time to feel emotions, one dialog to another  i know here chris uses that on  purpose he change the genre into fast pace drama. instead of fast drama the events should be faster .

"I feel much the same way. I found absolutely zero issues with the acting. A lot of great performances throughout the whole movie. But man, everything else was some degree of an issue for me. I didn't enjoy it overall despite it having some really fantastic moments. Worse than anything I ultimately ended up finding it pretty boring. The constant assault of tension ended up taking away any tension for me and then the cuts between the storylines kept me from really investing in any of them. I found he used a very similar filmmaking style as Dunkirk but I loved it's use there and it also made so much more sense to have these 3 separate timelines as they all coalesced on one moment.

"As far as marketing I think what you mention was sort of inevitable with this movie. First, like you say it's kind of hard to market a biopic, especially with Christopher Nolan's name on it and all the expectations that comes with. Second, it's Oppenheimer so naturally the specter of the bomb looms large, you can't exactly market the film without that. Once that's out and it's ""Nolan's made an atomic bomb movie in IMAX with practical effects"" it's hard to reel those expectations back in.

Having said that, I'm still just a little surprised that someone could sit through the 3 hours of this film and come away unimpressed because the visuals didn't match up with what they expected. I get the other criticisms even if I don't share them; didn't care about the Strauss character, couldn't follow what was happening because of the confusing structure, didn't care much about the events post trinity test etc. But the ""the nuke in this movie looked better, needed some cg to beef it up"" comments are strange to me.",2023-07-25 10:18:57

"I have never seen that trailer before, I can see a reasonable argument that it was misleading to people not interested in the biopic part. I wouldn't be surprised if they spun it that way on purpose to get the views. To be honest I wanted to watch it once I heard the title, then hearing the director just made more amped.

I think Nolan intended the 'how?' to be implied by the mood shift once the test was over. Despite the rest of Los Alamos being excited and Oppenheimer shaking hands, the mood changes to the feeling that something is wrong. Part of it, I think, was to show that Oppenheimer, and other scientists, didn't \*need\* to see the affects of the bomb to know what its capable of. This is hinted at when he discusses when they discuss that every Physicist already knew they were building a bomb once the message got out the the Germans split the atom. Also Oppie is shut down each time he tries to voice his concerns, his rally speeches and his discussion with Groves on the train already show his ideas. We can't know anything else that might've happened because his main story ends (irl and in the movie) when Strauss successfully revokes his clearance. The discussion of whether or not he is a communist literally decides his ending. The biopic cares if he was a communist because it's a biopic, not a discussion on the cold war or WW2.",2023-07-25 16:00:41

"It can get overwhelming at times for sure, but the Veritasium video had it’s own faults too. It focused much too on the science portion of the bomb, by the middle and end of the video, rather than discussing Strauss and Oppenheimer’s conflict and all the hearing details about other main scientist’s testimonies and how some people hated Oppenheimer and planned alongside Strauss to degrade his reputation, after what he had done for the country, just to satisfy their egos. Those portions however long and exhausting, were depicted in the movie.
And Social Network doesn’t stand a leg compared to this movie, this one was a thorough character study to an extent of the knowledge available with insights on Strauss’s views revealed why he ratted out Oppenheimer to FBI.",2023-07-25 18:03:34

There is another war (the Cold War) coming, there is a lot of communist hunts. 

The movie doesn't feel like a story. It feels like we're watching a real human's life unfold.

It just follows a certain portion of his life.",2023-07-26 00:24:34

"Framing ""Oppenheimer's"" life around two separate hearings running along three timelines was the issue. 

Giving two minutes of screen time to the antagonist for the first 130 minutes of the movie, then having him dominate the third act to reveal some hollow twists and get his comeuppance from an assistant telling him he's not important was ridiculous.

We could have gotten a great exploration of ""Oppenheimer"" and his struggle had Nolan made different narrative choices or found a way to condense his choices artfully.

Given the last two minutes of the movie, Nolan really seems to think the bomb itself and the ripples it created in history are pretty important and what we should walk away thinking about. He just decided to take an hour detour, frantically jumping around timelines before abruptly tying things back together.",2023-08-07 13:03:38

Not about changing plot but the decision to tell the story that way. Did it need to be a political intrigue plot with that level of intensity? I felt the way they were handling the clearance and hearing was good enough but then Nolan decided to amp up the drama post trinity. It works within the movie but a bit silly outside it.,2023-08-24 07:39:25
"I feel like his switch in mentality is fairly understandable, especially with the notion that he felt that seeing the bomb in action would deter the world from ever using it again, just to see the biggest nations of the time fervently pursuing making even stronger bombs. I also think it's valid to stop thinking differently about your invention immediately after it's actually been utilized to kill 100s of thousands of people.

">I didn't sign up to watch a 3-hour film lamenting the construction of the nuclear bomb for the to white-wash the actual victims during his Lucid Dream Sequence while giving the Bleacher Speech.

The movie wasn't about the bomb though, it was about Oppenheimer and how he dealt with the fallout (pun not intended) from what he created. Everyone knows those bombs caused incredible damage, but one of the bigger points of this movie was to show how Oppenheimer went from having this goal that consumed him, to almost hating being associated with it. Showing the audience a bunch of people burning and melting doesn't do a whole lot to add to his inner turmoil.

I thought the dialogue was on the nose in the first half a bit as they’re establishing his background (like the scene with his brother), but as it gets past the bomb I thought the movie just really excelled. 

Nolan obviously isn’t a guy that does subtlety well, so he went as big as possible and I thought for what the movie deals with it worked perfect.

It's that whenever a woman is on screen it's in service to the male character.

Interstellar. Yeah there we go with some emotion, and Inception has it too. In Batman movies I cared about Joker, Bane, Alfred, Gordon - but not the main character.

The stakes were what was going to happen to the world now that nations had access to power that could wipe civilizations off the world. Oppe hoped the atomic bomb would lead to world wide peace not a version 1 (version 2 being the hydrogen bomb). Ultimately the 'personal vendetta' between Strauss and Oppe was the idea of military secrecy and power VS worldwide knowledge and mutually assured destruction (MAD). This set the stage for the cold war and the US vs USSR struggle moving forward. It was much bigger than egos,2023-07-28 16:08:24
"That doesn't track. The movie was full of exposition for politics and geopolitics. Russia, Japan the White House. Why jump back that far for this. Why the apple, even.

I know it's a biopic, but artistic license exists. We knew the story was framed around some sort of trial, but the stakes were not communicated until the last quarter. You don't see a problem with that?

Oh Nolan's great with writing obsession. But with the rest of the human emotions, not so much. Not to the extent of M. Night Shyamalan of course, but by a difference of degrees, not type. Thankfully it had fantastic actors and a great score to make up for it.",2023-07-28 16:12:45

"Hi, found the scene underwhelming here because it did not look like an atomic explosion, not because I was expecting a crazy action movie. Everything about the scene and leading up to the explosion was great, and I was holding my breath on the edge of my seat during the countdown. The visuals themselves is what was disappointing to me and I am far from the only one with this opinion. Not being contrarian, that's just how I felt as the scene played out. Might seem like a nitpick to you, but a lot of us were expecting more. 

Your criticism of others not being impressed and how they all must be uneducated teenagers comes off as pretty condescending, not going to lie. I was decently educated on the events of this film prior to seeing the movie, and quantum physics and theory has always been a strong interest of mine so it's not like I don't appreciate the subject matter. In fact, I was hoping the movie would focus more on these aspects rather than the controversies of Oppie's ties to communism.",2023-07-26 19:18:27
"I mean he's clearly shown in the movie to have done some important work — several characters say ""oh I read your paper about molecules"" so his reputation precedes him.

"Oh my, that makes so much sense, thank you ! However, they did meet during that one meeting about the project right ? They were talking about how the bomb was leaked and that there were proof that the german started creating the same bomb as them or something like that. Strauss talked to Oppenheimer as if he knew him well, and then after Rabi ask him if he's sure he want to talk instead of Strauss because what he say will be considered absolute and there Will be no place to any error while Strauss can afford to make a mistake (something around that). It was in the middle of the project, they didn't finish the bomb yet and were scared that the german would finish it first, and the way Strauss acted and talked to Oppenheimer really did seem like acquaintance, he even put his hand on Oppenheimer's shoulder and told him something. I clearly remember Oppenheimer specifically telling Groves that he would absolutely go to the Manhattan meeting even if they wouldn't let him, when they were in Los Almos, so before the bombing. Or did I also get the chronology of this scene wrong ? Was it actually after the bombing, after meeting with Strauss ? Were they talking about the Russian and not the German like I thought I remembered it ? 😵 thank you so much for your answer btw, I really appreciate it",2023-08-20 05:26:13
"Sort of agreed, but Dune IMAX was better in terms of delivery and utilization of the big screen. 

Also",2023-08-30 05:12:54
"Yes but it is such a strange thing to focus on what felt like the larger half of then movie to me. It felt like it tried to juggle remorse and weltschmerz, with Oppie's career dreams and reputation. And maybe there is a point that is attempted here on Strauss being right in that Oppie ""would do it all over if he could"". But it's a weird dynamic to give the viewer who is simultaneously watching Oppie imagine he's stepping into the charred remains of a human body. In any case it doesn't come off very clear what it wants to say.

The final moments of the movie is getting the reveal his security clearance isn't being renewed and he calls his wife to tell her to not take in the sheets implying that was as important to him as the Trinity test. Then at the same time we're told Strauss thought too much about himself thinking Einstein was talking about him, that ""there might be bigger things at hand here"", but it's so frustrating because that is what I want to tell the whole movie. I understand the security clearance was important for his credibility and gives leverage to making a court drama, the world's most loved-hated genre. But I think it was a poor choice for being about the person who spearheaded the atom bomb. That it focuses on his career and affair rather than just how much the invention changed the world, the victims and him personally. It goes a little into that but far too little to feel like it knows what it wants to say, in my opinion anyway.",2023-07-28 09:12:32
"I get that, it just feels so insignificant, like a formality. I realized during the movie that it has an impact on Oppenheimer‘s career and reputation, but I didn’t care much about his character either. 

That might be a major point in the movie. I didn’t care about trinity being successful because I knew the outcome before I entered the cinema. I didn’t care about the main character because he doesn’t seem to struggle at any point, the early university scenes (cyanide apple era) felt so artificial and fabricated - no, you’re not the antihero i root for just because you’re laughed at in class once. I subsequently didn’t care about his q clearance, actually I was puzzled why it was even an option to keep it after the project, shouldn’t it be on a need to know basis, shouldn’t he be happy to be able to return to university?

I also didn‘t care much about the McCarthy era thing because… I don’t know why I didn’t care. 

The main thing I cared about in the movie was the marble glass filling up because I believed the glass being full would mean trinity and/or hiroshima and the end of my suffering, but I was wrong.",2023-07-28 10:16:10
"> The security clearance gave him credibility and knowledge of what was going on with bomb development.

Not really. Keep in mind that one of the main reasons Strauss tried to undermine Oppenheimer was because of their ideological differences on the H-bomb. So the issue of his security clearance was a manifestation of the more important conflict, not an independent conflict. And one man's opinion about the H-bomb, even if that one man was Oppenheimer, hardly made a difference. The drama over the security clearance seems to have had much bigger implications for ego than for geopolitics.",2023-07-28 16:21:46

As it says in the book, Luis Alvarez (the very character in the movie), was sitting in a barber chair reading the paper when he read a blurb about the Hahn/Strassmann experiment. And then he went next door to Oppie in the Radiation Lab and recreated the experiment.

edit: the source they attribute for this story is Alvarez's autobiography, and they put the date as Jan 29th, 1939. That will have been the timescale it took for information to cross the continent (via letters) so it's not really out of line with the Columbia experiment.",2023-07-23 19:20:24

I disagree that the film was hard to follow. The films visual cues clearly illustrated when it was a different time period either through the costumes or the usage of black and white. I think way too many people are confusing this for a four quadrant movie when it definitely has an intended audience. It's not Endgame or Missioon Impossible, where you can just turn off your brain and view it. Nolan, as a filmmaker, makes most of his films require multiple viewings.

Reply to your edit: Totally disagree. Here’s another video with the Empire State Building as reference (first 20 seconds) — https://youtu.be/SgspnpDDfJU.

Then a again, with all the Nolan time skips, Oppenheimer sees the aftermath pictures. Then he is able to fully visualizes how awful it was. 

With the sequence, Everyone cheering and then sudden silence and that Scream, I really got startled. Scared even with what I was about to see. Not into gore but do wish he would have gone brutal. 

Concerning Jean, what ruins it is the flow. Kitty is reminded about the affair at the hearing. The way Oppenheimer mentioned it was the last time, it alludes to suicide. Then we get a whole other plot sequence before coming back to Jean. Suicide or assassination?

Even something as simple as keeping 2-3 actors within the frame and just slowly push the camera in would've been... *something*, I don't know.


I can understand if on a conceptual basis you want to make it appear fast and snappy so the audience doesn't feel the 3h runtime, but I have to be honest, when I was seeing the film, said editing in my eyes was hurting the actors' performances.


They are absolutely great throughout, Cillian Murphy especially/obviously, but I really felt like the editing was holding everyone back, when in certain sequences the camera should've stayed focus a little longer on their face, reaction, and so on...

"He orchestrated the entire smear campaign against Oppenheimer to keep him from getting his Q clearance renewed. This is what the entire hearing was about. If denied renewal, Oppenheimer would not be able to be a part of nuclear weapons regulations going forward.

Strauss sent the military guy to interrogate Oppenheimer while the room was bugged, he used the communist leaning friends in his life against him, he made his questionable choices in his love life public etc.

Strauss also wanted to pursue the more destructive hydrogen bomb that Oppenheimer didn't want to pursue. Oppenheimer wanted heavy regulations on nuclear weapons, Strauss wanted them for military might, more political power and to further the military industrial complex.

The whole dynamic is highlighted by the discussion between Oppenheimer and Einstein near the pond at the college. Strauss thinks that Einstein and Oppie are plotting against him and this is what eventually sets Strauss over the edge and begins his campaign to destroy Oppie's life. In reality its revealed they were discussing the calculations that would determine if a nuclear detonation would destroy the world. This entire scene is shown multiple times to highlight the differences in motivations between Oppenheimer and Strauss.  


The entire movie is revolving around the hearing regarding Oppenheimer's security clearance renewal. That is truly the central point in the film, not the bomb. It focuses more on the future implications for the world after the detonation.",2023-07-28 01:01:01
"Just so I understood that exchange: >!Oppenheimer is referring to the fact that developing the A-Bomb has created a ""chain reaction"" in the meta sense of the world pushing to build larger and larger bombs and thus inevitably destroying itself?!<",2023-07-31 13:28:51
"I know it was likely Nolan taking creative license because that scene played a central part of the anger that Krauss drove him to be bitter of Oppenheimer, but I am curious how Einstein would have reacted in real life.",2023-07-31 13:30:48
"I didn’t like the movie. I generally like Nolan and am reasonably familiar with Oppenheimer and the Manhattan project. I was really keen on watching it on IMAX and bought the recommended middle seats. 

The movie was - blah. It was pretentious, self important and superficial. Other than acting and a few great shots, the rest of the movie was mediocre. The amount of importance given to Strauss and the two hearings is an odd and jarring narrative choice especially when the subject matter was as heavy as the creation of the atomic bomb. This was a mediocre movie and if I was watching it at home I wouldn’t have finished it. We were at the theatre stuck in middle seats so we felt compelled to see it through. There was also a glimmer of hope that watching it through may salvage the movie. It didn’t.",2023-08-07 05:18:13

"I think it's a good movie if you you temper your expectations a bit. It is not perfect. It is unfortunately not only about the Manhattan Project, which is its strongest part. There's an hour devoted to what I think was irrelevant nonsense, but some people apparently enjoyed.


The parts I enjoyed were very good. It was cool seeing the big, loud parts on a big screen. The rest of the film is...meh.",2023-07-22 23:15:32

"So basically we have to be OK with their relation not being explored at all, not showing why they actually cared for each other, then being shown that he is devastated by her dead, although we only know that they hooked up once and she rejected him but not really, and then we forget about her, because her only purpose is to be one of the hundred examples of his martyr complex. Their relation sounds interesting and maybe it could have been developed and actually amount to something. Putting so much importance on their relation without actually telling us anything about it is just lazy writing.",2023-07-26 23:01:50

I think it had a really interesting effect by using IMAX for court scenes and close ups. It made the audience feel *surrounded*. I felt like I had no escape, no where to turn, no where to go. I felt suffocated by the screen a lot of the times (especially the trial since the room is so small).

"Lmao you're not alone. I've seen so many 'it was so chilling that it stayed with me and I couldn't forget it' comments.. I was really confused. But for me script is everything.The movie's script,compared to how tight Nolan's previous ones were, is average to just good at best. It's not comparable to his greatest hits.. Probably cause there's not much liberty he could take story or graphics wise. He excels at that. Making original set pieces. The speech scene here is a testament to that. With everything else there wasnt much he could do since it's basically just a lot of two and fro.",2023-07-21 23:07:14

I saw it recently at home and I'm not a Top Gun type of film fan at all and I found it a very good movie. Maybe not a 10/10 but for sure 9/10. It knows what it wants to do and it nails it. The only reason why I don't give it 10/10 is because that movie is not trying to be a masterpiece. Compared to Oppenheimer it is better in pretty much every single way.

"I disagree, but a lot of that has come from listening to 6 hours of the last podcast on the left deep dive on the manhatten project they've been doing over the last month and a half leading up to it.

The point of this movie is ""Oppenheimer was a genius who was loyal to his country who was ostracized for his political beliefs disagreeing with the military industrial conmplex.""

LPOL paints a picture more akin to ""Yeah he wasn't a fucking spy, that's fucking stupid, but he *was* amazingly high on himself, a womanizer, and spent years trying to 'debunk' radiation poisoning both for national propaganda and the sake of his own conscience. So I dunno, fuck him, probably.""

I'm also in the opinion that any movie ""about"" the atomic bomb that doesn't include accounts or details from Hiroshima and Nagaski is at best, dishonest, and at worst, propaganda.",2023-07-24 00:56:23
"Is perfectly reasonable to compare one movie to another if it's done by the same director. Saying that I'm ""tone-deaf"" is just more or less telling me that I'm right because you're being defensive and don't want me comparing the two.

Oppenheimer and The Dark Knight are both based off pre-existing source materials. Both of which he adapted for film. One was a graphic novel, the other a piece of literature. How the hell is it ""tone-deaf"" to compare the two?

I think you're just pissed because I think Oppenheimer isn't a 10/10 UTTER AND COMPLETE MASTERPIECE like others are saying. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong. But the soundstage overpowers the dialogue in several scenes, the opening act moves at break-neck speed, much to the detriment of setting up a foundation of characters other than  Oppenheimer, and much of the film relies on visual and audio grandiosity to entice it's audience through the monotonous scenes of Oppenheimer and his quest for security clearance.

It's a 7/10 at best.",2023-07-24 01:27:48

"Memento is peak Nolan at his most artistic in my opinion. The opening scene where he's shaking the Polaroid picture, only to have the photo **decrease** with exposure fade over time with that melancholic score... Man, I knew I was in for a treat. What a great fucking movie, and it also did time-skips VASTLY better than Oppenheimer.",2023-07-24 01:37:24
"I think the best moment he's put on film is the docking scene in interstellar.  I just saw Oppenheimer, so I'll need time to process it, but it's definitely an achievement.  There's nothing as exciting in it as the highway chase in Dark Knight, or the hotel fight in Inception, but it's a different kind of movie.  As a wwii/mid-century era biopic, it's incredibly kinetic and cinematic.  The score and sound design alone are worth experiencing in a theater.  Compare it to Theory of Everything or The Imitation Game (other movies about scientists of the time).  I like both of those movies, but they aren't on the scale of Oppenheimer.",2023-07-24 01:45:26

Losing the clearance is framed mostly as a superficial political stunt to help in the whole neutering his political power initiative from rdj.

"The movies have very different plots and themes, this is true. And the choice to make only light use of music in no country for old men was to make the movie feel more life-like, I agree there as well. 

However, the nuclear bomb was invented in real life too. There is no orchestra when bombs go off. It shouldn’t have been necessary for the director to scream “this is a high tension scene, hear the violins??” when the nuke is fired.

I think we just have different tastes to a degree. I have grown to detest the over reliance on music in movies, it reveals the invisible hand of the director and breaks the illusion of immersion in the film for me now. But to each his own.",2023-08-04 10:17:35
I must say this did make me crave a movie that is a historical drama about the making of the bomb. I’d love to see someone like Ridley or Spielberg do that. I miss big historical movies done in a classical style.,2023-08-04 11:19:08
"The thing I take issue with here is that the opposite stance on what Oppenheimer and his scientists did was portrayed through the eyes of selfish, egotistical politicians with an axe to grind, which greatly de-legitimizes their point of view. And perhaps their point of view is indeed worthless and everyone SHOULD be fully in favor of what Oppenheimer and his scientists achieved, which is honestly a fair way to judge it, but it becomes incredibly UNfair when one side of this discussion is being pedaled by the worst kinds of people for the exact wrong reasons. It was a way of making the audience think ""poor Oppenheimer"" when it would have been more interesting to see him be pressured by people with unbiased reasons to be skeptical about the use of nuclear weapons and the development of them, which should be treated as a completely valid point of view. IMO it really took away from the complexity of the issue by taking this angle.

At the very least, it sure wasn't worth an entire hour of the movie tacked on after the execution of the Trinity Test to explore this. Maybe a half hour tops.",2023-08-03 12:05:41
"I get that the movie is about Oppenheimer and not just the bomb. However, it doesn’t matter. The plot they chose to zoom in on for the last third of the movie wasn’t interesting to me.

"Of course, I didn't mean that a lot of dialogue is bad, my problem is that they way it's presented makes it impossible to understand. 

They wouldn't allow any beats between lines. In most movies, editors allow a brief moment of silence between lines, so that you have time to process what's being said. Also, the rhythm feels more natural, because it's the way we talk in real life.

In Oppenheimer, it feels like the editor was on a quest to shave off as many tenths of seconds as possible, so you end up with cuts JUST as the soundwave for the last word has ended. It's a 3 hour dialogue sprint. It hurt my ears and my brain.",2023-07-22 16:48:18

The point was that he was being rebuked by the very government he had helped usher into the atomic age. He was using his position to try to positively influence the course of history and they shut him out.

"Oppenheimer's ousting from the AEC informs scientists' opinions on working for and informing the gov't on issues of policy to this day. Given that Oppenheimer is the subject of the film and not just the Manhattan Project, seems like a sound decision to me.",2023-07-21 15:00:32
I shouldn’t have to read a Wikipedia page to enjoy a movie. I get that the movie was based on real events but I thought the story arc of his moral dilemma of building the bomb should have been the main focus. I felt like the trial took away from that.

"He killed that role. The character was polite in the interview/interrogation with Oppenheimer, but you could almost feel there was a menace behind it.",2023-07-29 17:58:31
"The unfortunate thing is it really wasn't how it would look- Trinity was one of the most scientifically documented things in human history at the time it went off, we have plenty of reference of how it and many later single-stage nuclear devices look when they went off and they really don't resemble what he did. What he did was still great, but it was one real lacking point in the film for me.

The more artistic representational stuff was perfectly fine and did a good job of communicating feeling, but because human brains are really good at pattern recognition, it was super *super* obvious that the actual fire in the explosions they set off practically was a thousandth the size of the real trinity blast. (Very much the opposite of the bigger-than-reality fire that old supermarionation stuff like Thunderbirds had)

Like, it looked good, and it served the point, but for a movie that had been trying to limit it's use of CG and enhancement, it would have probably served the message better to go absolutely as hard as possible in recreating the most visually accurate explosion in that scene, as well as the most visually accurate gore in the ""hallucination"" scenes (as that would have looked better IMO than latex-mask-flaps-in-the-wind), and would have massively helped service the message of this-is-power-of-the-gods-level-shit better.",2023-07-22 10:49:50

"I actually appreciated the pacing in the first half. I think it helped convey a sense of things just happening one after another, with little pause for reflection, which I think reflects Oppenheimer’s involvement with the project. If he had taken time to reflect, he may have had second thoughts, but he just kept going, even after the original moral justification for his participation (fighting the Nazis) became moot. He was just kind of carried along by the flow of events, which I think is a pretty realistic depiction of how people sometimes end up doing and being involved in things that they regret.",2023-08-06 05:44:01

"I think the scale coulda been shown better to if we got a good *physical* look at where everyone was in relation to the bomb?

I’ve read two books about The Manhattan Project, one of which was more about the dropping of the bomb itself and one of which was much more heavily focused on Oppenheimer. I have two degrees in mathematics and understand the physics as well as anyone who isn’t actually a nuclear physicist. I do not need context to understand this film.

I also thought that it was bloated, slow, and was not at all the movie that was advertised. Half of it took place in the 50s and was centered around a security clearance meeting that I just couldn’t care about.",2023-07-25 11:13:15

That said, I never said I expected them to take up 50% of screentime. But I did hope that if there were going to be women portrayed, they might have a little more substance than fantasy sex object and nagging wife.

I'll also reinforce my original points that this is a trend for Nolan and not all of his movies are historical.",2023-07-26 05:34:57
"They didn't mean that at all and you know it. It's just really noticeable that the women in this film barely have any substance. 

Take Jean for an instance. Oppenheimer apparently loved her a lot, but what do we learn about her other than that she looks good naked and seems mentally unstable? 

Kitty's backbone and integrity imo only comes through due to Emily Blunt acting her ass off. 

Nolan gave us a few tiny crumbs hinting that there's more to these women, but crumbs aren't character development.",2023-07-26 10:54:41
"Fair enough. Women aren't a monolith and I don't expect every woman to agree with me. 

Imo, Emily Blunt was only on screen to nag and Florence Pugh only existed to be his Tragic Pixie Dream Girl and fulfilled largely the same role women have in a lot of Nolan's films. I wouldn't see it as such an issue if it wasn't a trend in his movies now. Like I said, I just don't think his work is for me anymore",2023-07-26 03:16:01
"Of course I understood the film. It was a very simple film. I just did not like the choices the screenplay made. The film “talks” about politics but is not political. No main character in the film is really a political figure. Oppenheimer himself seems political in some scenes but acts completely apolitical in others. So he seemed like he was political until the room requires him not to be. He seems to be upset about Hiroshima until he’s not.

So he seemed to be an ordinary phsicist, who did not have any strong opinions about making the bomb one way or another. That’s what makes him uninteresting.",2023-07-26 16:56:22

"> Oppenheimer is the one that seems incapable and unwilling to shoulder up and really fight against his opposition. 

My take on Oppie's unwillingness to fight back against Strauss and AEC inquisition is this: he thought that the entire ordeal was the necessary penance, the suffering he would need to go through to receive absolution for the sin of unleashing nuclear weapons upon the world. When Kitty tells him ""You really think by letting them tar and feather you that they would forgive you?"" - Oppie was seeking forgiveness, but not from Strauss and his AEC lackeys... he was looking for it from the rest of us, from future generations.

It's an ironically Catholic interpretation given he was a secular Jew, but (not covered in the film) Oppenheimer also did say at a postwar lecture that ""physicists have known sin"" as a result of the creation of the A-bomb.",2023-07-25 02:07:37
"Oo I love that take from this scene!! I can see how that would be presented too, especially with the close up screen time they gave her.

I’m really torn because I think everyone’s performances were basically perfect, and the direction was great, incredible cinematography. It was just the editing that really fucked it up for me.

Everything from the start of the countdown, masterful, the build up, 10/10. The actual drop? Ehhhhh.  


It's not much different with the criticism that Doctor Strange 2 had where the ""Multiverse of Madness"" really only has like one 15 second sequence of going through different universes.

And what do you mean by these dumb nitpicks? I’m not looking to pick apart films in order to dislike them, I went in to this film being a fan of Christopher Nolan and excited to watch it, thinking that I would enjoy it.

And less focus on titties.

The trials and hearings took like half the movie, it just felt dragged.

Don't get me wrong, its not like I didn't like the movie, I fucking loved it, I just expected a little more in some aspects.

The scene with Florence Pugh grinding the guy while he read ""The Bhagavad Gita"" felt so unnecessary and cheap, it was a huge Netflix vibe. 

Her fucking him in front of like eight men was just... dude wtf.

Movies like Interstelar, Contact, Imitation game etc had this kind of focus.

But its just personal opinion, thats all.",2023-08-10 00:30:39
"I'm not the one who posted this comment, but from context, I would say he probably found it offensive that this movie, which was marketed just as heavily as being about the creation of the atomic bomb as about Oppenheimer himself, chose to not explore its role in the wholesale killing of whole populations of people, but instead focused on McCarthy era Communist witch hunts, implying that that is somehow more important than Oppenheimer's role in the death of innocents. His comment also could be read to suggest that the Oscar bait tactic of having so many big names to play such small roles could have cheapened the impact of the real story. But again, I didn't write the initial comment, so these are just guesses",2023-08-27 15:09:20
Watch the test footage. It looks more powerful than what we saw in Oppenheimer. Honestly a letdown.,2023-07-22 06:13:12
"Well yes, but I just feel that as a consumer of a product, 20 seconds of a bomb is a little bit too little, seeing as they basically marketed the whole movie as ""we're working on a top-secret project of building a bomb"", and the bomb is shown for about 20 seconds. I do understand that the movie was intended to be a biopic of Oppenheimer's life, but going into the movie, I was under the impression that it would just be about making the bomb.",2023-07-22 15:31:20

I can’t remember the last time I walked out of a movie, if ever. But when I look at my watch and there was almost 90mins left I couldn’t cope!

"The sex scene in the hearing made perfect sense to me. He was facing consequences for going to meet his communist mistress, both personal in regards to his relationship with his wife and for his career in the hearing.

"You focus on the most important parts of the person’s life though.

They could’ve spent a lot less time on the communism stuff pre Los Alamos, or made it better. He’s a communist, but it felt like it was never really explained *why* and was just the actor saying “I am a communist” into the camera.

Could’ve spent more time on Los Alamos and upped the tension. It felt very languid and low stakes somehow. Most of the famous physicists felt underutilized. Einstein looked like a homeless person, like some kind of caricature. I didn’t even realize that Quaid played Feynman until after the movie - what an astronomical waste. Feynman plays the bongos.

Bomb’s explosion could’ve been the climax, with the resolution being mostly the same *without* the trial. Having another act with lower stakes felt really weird. Keep the sad falling action a la The Irishman and save a ton of runtime. This also allows you to cut out a lot of the communism content.

Idk exactly what it needed, but it had too much squandered potential.",2023-07-22 15:51:12

"I'm not trying to tear it down, it's a movie made by one of our contemporary masters, and certainly a *sincere* film, just not worth the massive praise it's getting imo. If this wasn't a Nolan film, as heavily marketed as it was, it wouldn't be the phenomenon it is today.

It's great that Nolan can, on his name only, trick general audiences into seeing a dry and demanding drama like this. But I can't help but smile while browsing YT and seeing all these ""critics"" who mainly review capeshit suddenly entranced by Oppenheimer. It's like hey, where are your PTA reviews, your Almodovar reviews, Terrence Malick, Haneke reviews? Or does a director need to make a superhero movie to get your attention? 

Oppenheimer is a proper introduction to cinema for many younger movie bros who never ventured this far before into movies where the only effects are lighting, framing, editing and acting. Nolan took them by the hand and told them ""look : there's an ocean of movies for you to fall in love with"". Sadly I think many of them won't explore further and think THIS IS IT.

It's very reminiscent of the Joker movie phenomenon, when people called it a masterpiece, when it was just a good drama with an insanely popular character. And people went on to wait for the next superhero film instead of watching the classics it's inspired from like Network or Taxi Driver.",2023-08-23 10:35:26

The Soviets declaring war on Japan and invading Manchuria would have been more than enough on its own, as the deaths of civilians meant basically nothing to the Japanese government at the time.

"I have the right to view things the way I view them. However, I didn’t say they were monsters. But they knew what they were doing. I’d rather the film show them owning up the that fact and not have them play both sides.  

Plus, even though I think the scene tried to humanize the A-bomb building scientist more, the woman leading the discussion made a good point: Hitler was dead. There was no need (by the military’s standards) for the bombs urgency, or to drop it. They mainly did it to show Russia what they could do.",2023-07-21 13:44:34

"Yeah, the polarized opinions are interesting on this one. I haven't seen Tenet because I read so many negatives about it (plus the premise didn't seem that interesting) but I definitely think it's my least favorite of his films.

I didn't even mind the dialogue heavy scenes, but as usual there are parts where its hard to grasp what is being said..plus the first hour of the film is just too frenetic jumping from one scene to another. Felt like a bunch of trailers about his early life instead of a movie. 

Didn't find the non-linear storytelling a positive with this one either. I think if they had a less talented actor than Cillian Murphy as the lead this would be so uninteresting. He was really, really good and kept me engaged..but otherwise it felt like a disjointed, oddly put together movie.

The fact he says the ""I am become destroyer of worlds"" line while having sex just automatically disqualifies this as being talked about as the best of anything. The score was also unbearable at times..someone should tell Nolan we don't need music blaring to realize this is a heavy/consequential scene. You can build up that tension more organically.

EDIT: Oh and the JFK line just made me laugh so much..the fact it was RDJ involved in the scene + the way it's said reminded me too much of Marvel's character introductions. Are we getting a Cold War cinematic universe?!",2023-08-04 15:11:30

The bomb should engulf you, it's 20000 tonnes of TNT exploding with a mushroom cloud with an height of 10000 metres.

"It's not as much about whether the scene works well with it but it's more about whether having the nudity in the scene adds anything. Both of the real life Pugh scenes basically accomplish nothing by having explicit nudity and could easily have been shot without it and accomplished the same thing narratively.

The scene that did need to be shot the way it was (but ironically without explicit nudity) was the vision scene in the hearing where while Oppenheimer's affair is being discussed Kitty sees Pugh and Robert naked in the chair.

Nolan instead chose an uncanny valley of neither, I just don't buy his explosion, it's a bunch of TNT detonated in the middle of the desert and it painfully looks as such. There's just so much wrong in this.

A nuclear explosion that close to the first bunker Oppie only had a view of the tower of debri not the mushroom cloud, that's one of the key aspects of a nuke being so overwhelming in it's show of force. The mushroom cloud would have been like a sun standing over Oppenheimer's bunker. If you've ever seen that test footage of the nuke tested close to soldiers in trenches you would get an idea of the sheer might and scale of this horror.

Instead this feels like somebody trying to explain to me the power of an artillery shell with a firecracker.

You make a good point that nobody yet has really *nailed it*. Well of all people I think Nolan and his budged had that chance.",2023-07-27 23:46:42

"Yes. Its his least crowd pleasing, heavy on drama and less on spectacle film (cinematography is still great though).",2023-07-21 11:53:03
"The film would've really benefitted from being called Trinity rather than Oppenheimer. At least personally, I would've loved for there to be a deep dive into the physics and complications of the actual Manhattan Project rather than just a biopic of Oppenheimer's life. I really could've done without the last third of the movie turning into a political courtroom drama. Call me lame but it turned a story that involved tens of thousands of people, billions of dollars and some of the coolest, most innovative science this world has ever seen into a cold-war hit-piece courtroom drama. 

As far as telling Oppenheimer's story it did a great job because you really can't separate what happened to him after the war from his story before the war. It was interesting but fell flat in terms of what I was really hoping to get out of this movie. 

Also that Trinity bomb was not a good representation. I admire how Nolan would rather not use CGI for such an important part of the movie but you cannot replicate the magnitude and aesthetic of a nuclear bomb with conventional explosives. It really didn't look realistic and was a bit of a letdown imo. 

Overall I'd give it a 3/5. It was definitely interesting but not something I'd go back to watch for at least a few years. As far as Nolan movies go it was pretty average imo.",2023-09-25 14:27:57

Well duh it is obvious that atom bombs are dangerous but the glorification of nukes in media has downplayed what these divine weapons truly are. But showing the real side of how the bombs very own creator felt is way heavier and more impactful than just simply showing a explosion scene in a movie. It requires critical thinking and despite the few who were bored the vast majority enjoyed the movie.,2023-07-22 21:06:29

Strauss to set out to destroy Oppenheimer and shift blame onto others saying the same things. I don't remember seeing the homicidal maniac Curtis Lemay in this film. Many people had personal and professional beef that Oppenhimer was nervous about building a truly horrific weapon. 

I don't think many people realize the difference in size of the bombs built in Las Alamos, and the fusion devices that Teller later built. It's the whole message of the third act. 

Einstein knows that Strauss led the effort to develop the hydrogen bomb and he was vehemently opposed to it.

It definitely *was* meant to be funny, from the filmmaker, not from the character. The character was being very serious, but what he's saying presents cognitive dissonance, it's humorous.

He takes Kyōto off the list for a personal reason, because the city holds sentimental value to *him*. Of course, this completely ignores the fact that many, *many* people have sentiments towards Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

It's a brief moment of dark humour that I think Nolan absolutely intended. You're laughing *at* him, not with him, for presenting such a ridiculous and obviously biased reason to take Kyōto off the list.",2023-07-23 07:24:57

"I think that is more valid about Nolan fans, who will just mindlessly call the movie a masterpiece without accepting any critique of it.",2023-07-23 09:01:05
"In my personal opinion the part that's meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering, but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes. A crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb. The movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction. So when he sees people drunk on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of drunk on power. Oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime, but when Truman blew him off and basically said I'm God, oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end. Probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 

Why the ending scene with Einstein should haunt you, is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here. We are the chain reaction. That's when Einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics. So the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away. Makes you think about who you are voting for, how much tech you use, and how we use AI

The movie was a 10/10. But as an engineer that studied nuclear energy I am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved (it was like the art rennisance but for science, the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex. quantum computing in the age of AI)  I already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man. Maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace. Brilliant character study of one of the world's most interesting people. He felt the music, he truly felt like a vessel of science and had higher Devine purpose.",2023-07-22 15:34:23
"Same here, lots of people saying they were shaken to their core by something that I thought was understood by everyone aware of the power of the weapon from the start, makes me wonder what I'm missing",2023-07-22 14:50:00
"The film goes to great lengths to convey the whirlwind nature of the project, with everyone feeling the pressure of an existential crisis due to the Nazis, the thrill of discovery and overcoming scientific obstacles. It's easy to deceive oneself in that environment, to mentally put off the inevitable, which comes crashing down on Oppenheimer as soon as the bomb is dropped. With no more project, there's no more distraction, he has to face reality.",2023-07-22 14:47:00
"For me it was when he said it, the reveal of what he said to Einstein, was just what he was saying the ENTIRE time. Oppenheimer set out to stop the nazis, what he (and his colleagues) accomplished was giving nuclear weapons to the nation that would eventually destroy his life, he didn’t stop the nazis, he didn’t see Hiroshima and Nagasaki as completely justified (if justified at all), and he didn’t succeed in tempering the development of nuclear weapons going into the future. What really got me though, was Strauss’ meltdown at the end, juxtaposed with Oppenheimer’s calm, dark, quip. One had his world taken away, the other may have destroyed everyone else’s, and the way they reacted was completely different.",2023-07-22 14:52:10
Exactly what I felt. Not able to understand people who say the ending shook them to their core,2023-07-22 14:47:45
"So I get the argument that it’s just regurgitating the same point.

But for me, it comes down to the way it’s shot, edited, then Cillian Murphy selling it with that haunting look!

To directly follow the scene where Strauss is convinced that Oppenheimer was conspiring against him from the beginning, to even turning Einstein against him, to being told “Maybe they were talking about something more important”, having us hang from the conversation earlier in the movie, to finally finding out what they were really talking about and the weight of it, shows the importance of it, and how it reflects on modern society and is as relevant as ever.

Then the music building, getting louder, tenser, while it zooms in on the haunting look Oppenheimers face to just then cut to black, it just lingered long enough to give me a sense of dread about modern society, and how we are never truly going to be safe from nuclear threat.",2023-07-22 20:07:06

That doesn’t work for me. Movies have dealt with atrocities before whether it be the holocaust or slavery so for me not showing the nuclear disaster or the silhouettes of the Japanese burnt into buildings doesn’t make the audience or Oppenheimer confront that dark reality in American history.,2023-08-08 22:28:21

Bro for me the first hour was boring cause I couldn’t even understand what they were saying. It was way to dialogue heavy,2023-07-22 22:50:41
You know the negotiation scene in Bohemian Rhapsody that has so many jump cuts it actually becomes jarring? The first hour felt like an extended version of that. The editing made what should've been a slow burn character study feel like a blockbuster action movie. It felt like I was watching a recap of an Oppenheimer TV show instead of a movie.,2023-07-22 22:53:08

I usually hate the quick cuts in films and it’s my biggest negative with Nolan films but here I think it actually works as a way to create this feeling of constant ascension and anxiety. The whole film feels like a three hour long panic attack. Even more so then Beau is Afraid. Reminds me of Uncut Gems and Requiem for a Dream and how quick the cuts in those films are.,2023-07-23 01:51:22

"Wrong. The ending was depicting what Fermi had predicted. Robert's last words to Einstien, in relation to the atmosphere igniting, was ""I believed it""

I love how Nolan’s finales always leave us with a thousand possible meanings. Like the end of Inception. Every single one of us interprets it differently and that’s beautiful.

I don't fault the audience for this. Honestly, it would have been nice if some, if not all, of the scenes could have had time to breathe to make sure everyone can follow it.

"General Groves said he wouldn’t have granted him clearance if the rules that were made were in place at the time of Oppenheimer’s hire.

The authors of American Prometheus said he was never red, but firmly placed him in the “pink” category.

Which is understandable, considering the Great Depression led many to believe capatlism was failing, and the political climate.

He remained a patriot, and it’s disgraceful how he was treated. Your last sentence is spot on. 

It is a slippery slope, but I can understand a Nation’s commitment to ensuring parties involved with its most sensitive national security secrets are the staunchly patriotic.

"My man you need a history lesson. The Japanese were actively discussing and pursuing peace talks, but Truman didn’t want to hear it and wanted to use the bomb to intimidate the Russians. That’s literally all in the movie as well. 

Racing the Enemy by Tsuyoshi Hasegawa is a definitive text that examines primary sources from the Japanese and Russian governments that proves this. 

The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb by Gar Alperovitz looks at Truman and his cabinet and shows that they considered other options, but ultimately decided that an actual quick peace was not as important as a pissing contest with the USSR.

"It’s part of the story, there was a scene where it was discussed how many died and how people’s skin melted together. Any book written about him would describe it in detail. He had moral questions about the event. And the filmmaking choices weren’t always realistic (such as him being naked at the hearing and his feet once being on ashes) so it could have been shown even if he wasn’t there.

"I thought the scene when he was giving the speech in the gymnasium was just as effective. Especially since he didn't witness the carnage, so instead he had visions of it happening to the people he knew.",2023-07-25 18:07:08
"They did talk about the firebombings. The scene where they discuss the targets opens with it. It's 2 sentences blink-and-you'll-miss-it but ot is discussed.

I think the not showing of the bombings mostly has to do with the movie being about Oppenheimer's journey ultimately, not atomic bombs. 

The movie starts as conversations between scientists in small indoor spaces with some outdoor scenes that prime Oppenheimer (and the audience) with themes of an existential nature and the relation between the intimate and the cosmic. Then this escalates into wide open spaces in the desert - visually communicating the grandeur of this part of Oppenheimer's life. He's huge, bigger than life at this point. Then this reaches its obvious climax and the existential, cosmic and intimate themes all erupt into a fiery chaos in the dreamlike darkness of the night (almost all the rest of the movie is during the day outside the intimate scenes). This fantastical fever dream bleeds into his nightmarish speech scene.

And then during the subsequent days the shots are very brightly lit initially. The cosmic dream/nightmare is over. The daylight is harsh, almost like when one has a hangover or wakes up after a ONS. And then the movie quickly draws oppenheimer back into small rooms.

That's Oppenheimers life. An academic, a god, an outcast. Small rooms, wide open spaces, small rooms.

Showing scenes of the bomb dropping (from airplanes or whatever) would completely ruin the flow of these themes/oppenheimers life. Because this movie is not about the horror of what we did with atomic bombs, it is about exploribg Oppenheimer's relation to his decision to create them - the build-up, the succes, and the impact it had on his life.",2023-07-26 00:06:12

"I was surprised to see Josh Hartnett having a pretty big role in the movie. I was wondering why and how just because he hasn't been around much. I guess he was one of the candidates for The Dark Knight, but declined. Nolan definitely saw something in him then and put him to good use now. 

Also read somewhere that Matt Damon was supposed to take a break from acting for a while, as a promise to his wife. The only thing that would bring him out of the break would be a Christopher Nolan movie. Guess he never took that break...",2023-07-22 15:23:22

The scene itself was stirring but it felt a bit weird that he of all people was the one giving it. He appeared in two scenes prior (without any dialogue) and both times he was just told off by Oppenheimer.

"In a movie full of people being naive about the Bomb, Truman's line about the Soviets never getting it (which he actually said) was the most naive statement of the film.

The moment they dropped it on Japan the Soviets were certain to develop one. They would have done it without Fuchs or any other spy. Knowing that the bomb could work beyond theory was enough to make the pursuit worth it.",2023-07-24 05:20:18
President hadn't seen the bomb go out live. He's aware of its scale only in the papers. Oppenheimer and the other scientists know the sheer scale of destruction caused by the bomb. There was at least one other scientist who was puking after the speech.,2023-07-23 23:08:32
"That’s not what he was even sorry about, how do people miss this? The “blood on his hands” wasn’t referring to the Japanese people, but the HUMAN RACE. Hell, the movie ends on that exact scenario! Oppenheimer knew what Truman didn’t, that these bombs could inevitably lead to the extinction of humans and that building a bigger bomb in order to “deys ex machina” our problems away was never gone work!",2023-07-26 11:32:04
A quick google suggests that scene is actually very close to how it actually played out.,2023-07-24 06:35:49
"IIRC, the line in the movie is close to what he actually said in real life too.",2023-07-24 07:22:11
"Oppenheimer still has to live with it, but this scene is important in showing the consequences he created for himself. He created something incredibly destructive and now the patrons he built it for are telling him to take his opinions and fuck off.",2023-07-28 08:05:54
">  The President is the one who actually had to make the call to drop the bomb and live with the decision. 

The extent to which it bothers you to have to live with the decision depends on how much you open yourself up to the guilt and the enormity of it. If you dismiss it or easily rationalise it, then it's not much. Truman might have been more directly responsible than Oppenheimer, but I'm sure he felt less guilty about it.",2023-07-29 14:12:04
"> I know the movie was trying to portray Truman as a dick in this scene but I was on his side.

One thing I loved about this movie is that it *is* kind of like a fusion/fission bomb with layers that set it off to make it be both very watchable/entertaining *and* complex. It’s structurally quite complicated (non-linear, multiple perspectives, multiple narrative arcs), on a scene-by-scene basis it’s pretty straightforward with fairly easy-to-parse character motivations and story goals (“Truman is a dick” “Oppie and Jean have a messed up relationship”), but the actors are able to bring complexity to this simplicity as are the beautiful visuals.

So for this scene we’ve got it fitting nicely with the themes of people who wield power being inherently undeserving of it, but we also see in Oldman’s performance the extent to which this decision *does* weigh on Truman, and he is largely correct that this blood was not on Oppenheimer’s hands. He says some very foolish and thoughtless things that reflect his character, but it’s also clear that his character goes far beyond those foolish thoughtless things.",2023-08-17 20:03:06
"Well, except for the Nagasaki bomb. Truman was never told the military was gonna drop it because they treated it like any other weapon in the arsenal, and you don’t inform the president every time you launch an artillery strike. Truman didn’t find out about Nagasaki until well after it was dropped, hence why now today the use of any nuclear weapon requires the president’s approval.",2023-07-30 07:47:23

He has never understood the scientific community and clearly he's never really wanted to, because he THINKS he does. I don't remember who said to Robert that he isn't like so many others thinking he's self important; he's ACTUALLY important. Strauss is one who's only self important and I think Robert knows that given enough time, it's going to come back around. What the movie shows is that he's right. What it doesn't show is that he goes on to still have major roles as a speaker and scientist, but it's kind of implied that his life was pretty great afterwards anyway as you see him being given his medal and accolades.",2023-07-23 17:09:07

"Alden's performance is going to be overshadowed by a cast full of amazing performances, but he was such an excellent audience surrogate for the Strauss side of the story. Most of his arc is conveyed through his facial reactions, and it just perfectly captures the evolving perception the audience has of Strauss. Really great character.

EDIT: Upon reflection, I see a lot of similarities between Alden's character and the character of Rev. Hale from The Crucible. Both are introduced as by-the-numbers pencil pushers who are on the antagonistic side more out of circumstance than anything else, but they're gradually disillusioned by the system over the course of the story and land as one of the few morally agreeable characters. It may just be the strong presence of McCarthyism in both stories, but I see a lot of similarities between the two works.",2023-07-22 19:51:35

It can just as easily turn out that because the horro of nuclear weapons were immediately unleashed, the trauma will fade just in time for them to destroy the world. 

Again, it's the same problem where we say ""maybe they prevented nukes to be used before now"" when we still don't know what the long term cost could be. Maybe they won't be used because they were used then, maybe they would have been used on a more horrific scale and that would have been the only effect.

There was a like about that in the movie. I can’t remember it verbatim but it was effectively “should we be bombing a country that’s effectively surrendering?” or something similar.

What would have happened had we held the bomb back is far more complicated than “Japan would have just surrendered still.”  And the Japanese Government had a part to play in that the same the Germans did when Hitler refused to surrender until they had fully bombed Berlin into the ground and got within a mile of him.

"> we never really are shown much about the actual discoveries at Los Alamos that got it there

**I think** Oppenheimer himself (maybe not in the movie) said that no actual new discoveries were needed to build the bomb. But I get what you’re saying: I thought there would be more exposition scenes about the building of the bomb—which is really a surprising thing to say for a Nolan film!

For example, I don’t think they talked that much in detail about U-238 and U-235, critical mass, etc. This film is not what I expected, which is saying something because I’ve been a Nolan fan for more than a decade.",2023-07-22 05:11:20

A Megaton is a thousand times larger than a Kiloton so using the lower end estimate of 18 Megatons, one warhead is *two thousand two hundred fifty* times the size of Hardtack.  And that single ICBM can carry **10** warheads that can each bomb a different target over a 150-200 miles range.

Through the whole movie there was a bit of a changing of the guard feeling when talking about the first generation of quantum physicists (Bohr/Einstein) and the new ones (Oppenheimer, Fermi).

"A lot of historians would say that Truman never made a ""decision"" to drop the bomb; no one did. Its use was assumed through the entirety of its development, and the actual decision-making with respect to its targeting, deployment, etc. did not involve Truman (whose only contribution was to tell Stimson to make sure the targets were military in nature; Stimson then removed Kyoto from the target list).

However after Nagasaki Truman decided to take unilateral control of the final decision making for any future bombs. He never recorded any of his personal feelings at the time, but Henry Wallace (secretary of commerce) wrote in his diary on August 10th:

>Truman said he had given orders to stop atomic bombing. He said the thought of wiping out another 100,000 people was too horrible. He didn't like the idea of killing, as he said, 'all those kids'.",2023-07-21 13:50:26

"I’m interested that so many people’s takeaway from that scene is ego. 

Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist, which is said explicitly several times throughout the movie. He worked in theories. His life’s work to this point was theoretical calculations on the deaths of stars, when he didn’t even know whether or not stars died. 

He throws himself into the work of making a bomb nobody realised was possible, it escalates, he achieves this giant goal after years of work - and suddenly it hits him that his work is not theoretical any more. His work had consequences, and that consequence was the death of 200,000 people  - a fact that seems to hit him at the gymnasium, where everyone is celebrating his wonderful achievement. 

He then spends the rest of his life knowing the genie cannot be put back into the bottle, so fighting for the next best thing - sharing intelligence so the result is MAD, not one country developing the biggest possible bomb that they *will* end up using if there isn’t a big enough deterrent. And his final act of genius is fighting a losing battle to get his clearance back, in order to get all of this on official record. 

I really didn’t see it as ego at all, but almost the opposite - that he finally snapped out of the ‘work towards this big goal and you’ll be a hero!’, and understood what consequences his actions really had. 

And remember the full quote:

> A few people laughed; a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; **Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him. takes on his multiarmed form and says, ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’** I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.”

I just love how people are pretending this movie is sooo deep. Like, there was audible confusion in my theater when Strauss was revealed as the “big bad”, because Nolan did almost nothing to introduce us to him as a person, or set up his original motivations. 

I watched this movie and saw what Nolan was *trying* to do, but he just can’t quite get there as a director. 

If you had fun, that’s great. But I will never not laugh at the pretentiousness of Nolan fans who refuse to show any critical thought for his works, and try to paint people who do as uNiTiLlEcTuAl",2023-07-22 15:12:00

True,2023-07-23 21:45:37

"Strauss wanted to stop Isotopes from being sent to other countries. Oppenheimer kinda humiliated him by showing how meaningless the isotopes really were.

More clear explanation from another comment:

From what I've gathered Strauss wanted to stop export of isotopes but didn't truly understand what he was asking for and got very publicly humiliated with Oppenheimer treating it as a complete joke and you would have to be stupid to support the idea (because the Isotopes have no use for nuclear weapons even though they are radioactive) Pointing out that Strauss has no idea what's going on and making mocking him very publicly.

As the man is a political operator he expects this would only happen between bitter rival. However I believe the movie tries to point out that Oppenheimer didn't care one bit about Strauss's games and would have done the same thing to anyone. Focusing on only 2 things trying to stop nuclear holocaust and trying to get everyone else involved to project their guilt onto him so only he has to suffer.",2023-07-27 07:11:49
"Agreed. I know RDJ turned in a good performance and it was satisfying in a petty way to see him humiliated but in the grand scope of the film, I didn't care about him at all. Felt like the Big Bad should have been higher-ups in the govt (the hearing, Truman, Groves turning distant) or the moral fallout (the clapping scene, how he knew the victim numbers, trying to stave off the H-bomb).",2023-07-23 21:33:56

Wars will keep happening, that much is evident today. The invention of nuclear weapons has just made it so that the casualties are relegated to other parts of the world.

The only reason why I get to where I'm at with the interpretation is that I just don't have the same emotional drainage after watching other movies with odd sound mixing. 

Oppenheimer seemed to be edited in a strange way. 1-2 minute scenes, particularly in the first 30 minutes, that feel like they're trying to invoke an emotional response, not convey important information for later on in the film.

"I get it but his dialogue is usually unremarkable as it is anyway and I feel like no one is actually missing out, it’s not substandard, it’s just pretty unimportant. This isn’t Tarantino level dialogue, it’s a lot of exposition, some sensical, some not, and a lot that pales in comparison to the visual storytelling. I’m not a Nolan fanatic, I love his films but none of them are perfect, but he’s not necessarily a dialogue person.

for me personally, all the pieces in the movie are amazing, it's just too much of it.

It was difficult to start forming a timeline of when each events take place.  After the project began they stopped doing that, and the movie was much easier to follow from then on.

I didn't really see the point of having any of the interrogation scenes in the beginning, I don't recall them giving any information in those scenes that the viewer needed to see at that time.

At the final scene where we find out what Oppenheimer said to Einstein at the pond I was confused because I thought the earlier pond scene was when Oppenheimer met Strauss and what he told Einstein was obviously after the bomb. I guess the original pond scene was a fast forward in time.  They just didn't make those jumps very clear in my opinion.

That's overstating it a lot. Especially when considering that a big reason why he lost the clearance was because he was opposed to the H-bomb. Even if he was a part of the conversations, the same ideology that vilified him would have driven people to ignore him.

He opposed the H bomb because of its massive destructive power, and Strauss made him pay for his opposition (and also because he's a narcissist who thinks Oppie humiliated him).

"That’s a valid point. But does Einstein not serve a similar function in far less screentime (particularly at the very end) instead of an hour with RDJ that’s largely disconnected from the “main” story/characters?

After all, it isn’t Oppenheimer who destroys Strauss, he does it to himself. And our Prometheus, like the mythological one, isn’t, in the end, “destroyed”…he’s tormented. Oppenheimer’s image largely recovers, he spends his last decades as a speaker, activist, and American icon…but he’s tormented to the end of his days because, just as he flippantly says of Einstein earlier in the film and is repeated back to him by the very same legendary predecessor, the knowledge he’s unleashed on the world has simply passed him by and is being built upon by those who’ll come after him. Oppenheimer, like Einstein, does not get to play gatekeeper to “his” findings. He doesn’t get to ensure that only the righteous wield the fire he’s given mankind. Like Prometheus, he’s propelled man forward…and given us the means to our own destruction in the same moment. His greatest achievement, the act that secures his place in history, is also his great sin and the cause of him having to endure the everlasting torture of knowing what he’s unleashed. Oppenheimer ends the film exactly where Einstein began it, being paraded around and given awards by the people who’ll use his gifts for their own ends, good or ill.

This.

I'm not saying the bombs are ""good."" War is hell (people also like to point to the atomic bombs yet don't know anything/don't care about the fire bombings that took place).

You know how many American's died taking the Japanese mainland? 0. It could have thousands upon thousands upon thousands. 

Hindsight is 20/20 - we have context and can look back and all angels. At the time, Truman was - more or less - presented with a choice the end the war with 0 American casualties. Why would he not make the choice he did?",2023-07-30 03:53:13
"> You do realize the die-hards launched an actual coup attempt to stop the surrender? 

Yes. But nobody outside the coup-actors was buying the ""depose Hirohito"" concept. The coup failed under its own design. 

For that reason, the Emperor as person and as symbol was the thing around which the end coalesced. 

He'd made the recording already so the bombs perhaps figured into the impulse to make the recording. 

> There were soldiers running around the Japanese Imperial palace trying to find the surrender recording so they could destroy it.

Indeed. 

> The Japanese were not going to surrender. It was atomic bombs, a genocidal starvation, or an invasion with tens of millions dead.

""It's complicated. Bit of a rabbit hole. "" People note a lack of evidence of a reaction to the bombs. That leaves a degree of freedom in any explanations. It's an only-partially decidable proposition.

"I guess so, but I didn't have any reason to think Oppenheimer didn't have integrity? Obviously he was extremely instrumental in creating the atomic bomb, but it wasn't his choice to bomb major Japanese cities (as Oldman-as-Truman very rudely points out lol), and it was pretty clear that he was only for creating the bomb to beat/defeat the Nazis in pursuing the same goal. I suppose it's noble to put yourself through a very difficult hearing where your name is kind of dragged through the mud just to lose a clearance level it didn't seem like he was incredibly interested in keeping, but I was kind of with Kitty when she said something like (I'm going off memory/paraphrasing so hopefully this is right haha), ""Why do this? Who cares if you lose that clearance level?""

And, just to be clear, I would estimate that it was \~1.5 hours for 1954 private hearing *and* the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing. While I felt like there were too many 1954 private hearing scenes that went on for a long time, at least they were directly pertinent to the character of Oppenheimer, so I take less issue with them. It's more all of the scenes involving Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing that I struggled to care about at all. Why do I care if he gets a cabinet seat or not? He's nobody in the story of Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb.

But I definitely respect your thoughts, and the political world vs. the academic world dichotomy definitely has some merit. I guess I'm glad Strauss lost, but, besides that, I struggle to care about his plotline. The framing devices were differentiated by black-and-white vs. color and Oppenheimer's appearance changed in early days vs. Los Alamos vs. his 1954 private hearing, but I also was confused in my first watch on the exact time periods and what was going on. It took a 2nd watch (with subtitles, 1st one was in theaters) for me to piece together the entire story well. I honestly kind of tuned out slightly my first watch and struggled to pay attention to some of the more minor scenes. My 2nd watch made me appreciate the film much more.

The last thing that occurs to me just now is that I don't have any inherent issues with intercutting between different scenes in different time periods/from different plotlines, but there should be a reason to intercut between them that adds extra meaning to the film or lets us see deeper insights into it. I don't feel that going from early Oppenheimer traveling the world to 1954 to 1959 to Los Alamos and then back to the other 2 1950's scenes added anything. Did we glean anything we wouldn't have gotten from telling the film in a completely linear fashion?

Which can be beautiful and it was an aspect I enjoyed on the big screen, but the fire was a different energy than an atomic bomb produced and it was disappointing that a movie that had a lot of visions of energy in the beginning got that part wrong.

I agree. I mean the movie was marketed as flames and being in ultimate IMAX. I think it's only fair for one to assume some spectacular visuals and existential suspense.

That movie had just about as much dialog and even more complexity because there wasn't a clear ""villain"" so to speak but it still managed to keep people a lot more engaged simply from filmmaking techniques - better timing of cuts, better points where new characters were introduced, better jumping back and forth between timelines.

"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the show and watched it 3 times, and while the majority of the inaccuracies were clearly made for understandable reasons (to make the show more functional), There were a fair few that were *really* bad and easily avoidable and really annoyed me for some reason.

**-A very poor explanation of the difference between radiation** ***exposure*** **and radiation** ***contamination.*** The show seems to give the notion that standing near a source of radiation for too long turns you into an emitter of it, when in fact it's the **ingesting** of radioactive materials that does this, and part of why the disaster was so uniquely dangerous.

**-The womans baby absorbing the radiation to save her life.** This was so stupid I couldn't believe it made it into the show. Absolutely nothing about it makes sense at any level. it was simply added to add drama and so that woman could say the line ""we live in a world where sons must die to save their mothers"" or whatever. Absolutely stupid.

**-The Cherenkov effect does not cause a Blue lightsaber to shoot up into the sky**. It's a mild blue glow that didn't extend beyond the reactor hall.

**-RBMK reactors specifically aren't the problem,** and I don't know why they were constantly mentioned. The problem is the parent category: Boiling Water Reactors.

**-RBMK control rods are not** ***tipped*** **in graphite.** This might be nitpicky but the entire bottom half of the rods is graphite. ""Tips"" to me implies just the very end like an eraser on a pencil.

**-The control room scene, while exciting, was loaded with BS.** I understand they need to make things dramatic for the finale but there's absolutely no evidence that arguing about raising the power took place. AZ-5 was not pressed in response to a power surge but simply as a routine planned shutdown, it's very unlikely Xenon poisoning played *any* role whatsoever in the stall, and all the plant operators were well aware of the test. All nonsense to add drama.

**-Dyatlov is made to be a villain which is unnecessary.**   
He stayed onsite for hours helping with the evacuation and was very cooperative with the investigators. He acted just as admirably as any of the others in the event but we can't have a TV show without a villain can we?

"Sure he had nothing to do with it personally, but his life story pretty much revolved around those events.. So there must have been a change in tactics or planning based on these very important events..

It just seems weird to ignore major events and solely focusing on Oppenheimer, when he was only tasked with creating the bomb because of such global events.. 

We don't need to watch another 3ish hour movie for each of these events when we could get 15ish minutes worth of scenes revolving around these that help paint the complete picture..

Whenever a movie is made around real life people and real life events, the director/writer is always tasked with the toughest job of deciding what to keep and what not to.. And while Nolan did a good job mostly, he missed out on certain key parts..

Showing a random professor for 5ish minutes isn't going to make me feel their importance without the movie telling me about why they are so important.. most of the characters aren't fleshed out enough and just act like background characters to maintain a complete focus on Oppenheimer, but this leads to most of the movie feeling like Oppie doing random talks with random people..",2023-12-28 11:43:33

Oppie before the Manhattan project (hasn’t met Strauss) studying in Europe, visiting Germany, returning to USA to teach physics

Oppie teaching (still not met Strauss), attempting to organise a union.

Oppie being asked to direct the Manhattan project (still no Strauss), talking to Einstein (who he already knew) about igniting the atmosphere. 

Oppie finishing the Manhattan project (almost at Strauss), meeting the president etc.

Strauss meeting Oppie, offering him a faculty position, seeing him talk to Einstein.

The entire movie and the book it's based on compares Oppenheimer to Prometheus. The man who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Oppenheimer gave the US government the power of the greatest weapon built at the time.

It was like bucket of popcorn that just got drenched in so much butter that it starts to ruin the snack. I like butter, but there's a limit, and Oppenheimer blasted right past that limit.

"Film is as much about the road towards building the bomb as much as his guilt over it. Having said that, here's the things I like and don't like.

Like: Nolan didn't show a pornographic, over-exaggerated sequence of death and mayhem. In fact, the few subtle scenes he shows of charred bodies, hysterical crying,  radiation poisoning, etc are very effective at getting the message across.

Don't like: The film is about Oppenheimer, sure. But his name is forever married to the invention of the nuclear bomb. And his guilt over that invention is a big theme of the film. It's only natural that if you want the audience to understand the gravitas of such an invention you show the actual devastation it causes.

The scene could've been carefully and respectfully crafted without being pornographic. A good example is the HBO series Chernobyl. They showed the terrible effects of the plant meltdown without exaggerating its already terrible effects. I feel Oppenheimer would've a stronger film had Nolan shown that.",2023-07-22 12:50:40

"\> But the ""the nuke in this movie looked better, needed some cg to beef it up"" comments are strange to me.  


hmm I don't personally think it needed CG in particular, it just needed *something* to elevate it? The the abstract shots in the opening felt really cool, the parts where Nolan tries to visualize Opps imagination felt 10/10, the effects/shots for the bomb itself? Felt like 7-8/10? I was sitting smack dab in the middle of an IMAX screen too but I just really didn't feel like I was seeing an explosion of an atom bomb in particular.   


I think it suffers the same issue that even Dead Reckoning did this time around. They advertised the hell out of the bike jump off a cliff which is cool in theory but it ultimately just felt lackluster overall for '*THE'* big stunt of the film. Especially compared to its predecessors. Granted I think MI has much more of a safety net compared to Oppenheimer cause it had 2-3 other action sequences to make up for it.  


I liked what Nolan was trying to do in theory for the bomb scene, trying to give the more *human* approach to it but I'd be lying if I said I would have wanted a bit more given how well executed everything before it was. The tension building was great but I feel like the aftershock was just, *there*. I just don't think Nolan successfully conveyed the *scale* of a nuclear bomb. I think he could have tried to physically show how far everyone actually was from the test site physically instead of just on the map for instance. That would've helped people like me actually go ""oh shit ya'll are really far away for this"".",2023-07-25 10:33:43

Don’t listen to them. I completely agree with you. This film was a sleep fest. My friend literally laid down across three movie seats and took a nap (we were the only ones in the theater except for like two or three other people).,2023-10-17 16:54:33
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way, I was like WTF is this? Looks like he threw some gas into a bonfire and filmed it close up. I thought he was going to create the inside of the bomb during the chain reaction using some crazy film technique but we got nothing",2023-07-21 12:36:36
"That is true. Nolan is too proud to use CGI even when it would have improved that scene manifold.

Another problem I have with the bomb test is that the mathematics doesn't work out. The sound travels at 343 m/s, and assuming they were sitting some 9 miles away, the sound should have been heard in 20-25 seconds, and not more than a minute later. It was very gimmicky.",2023-07-21 11:49:15
"Completely disagree. They do not give a good indication of how much time is passing, they don't really explain who everybody is and what they do, 30% of the dialogue is hard to hear because of the score that gets absurdly loud compared to the vocal levels, and its moving so damn fast that it's hard to digest. Not to mention the absolutely needless non linear story telling that adds nothing to movie except another way to push the pace forward and add confusion.

Like yeah, broadly speaking it's never hard to understand what is going on, but on a scene by scene basis Nolan doesn't seem to give a single fuck about conveying what it's supposed to mean. The movie is the epitome of ""Thing happens, thing happens, thing happens, Jean dies here's one scene of grief that's 10 seconds long, thing happens, end""

The movie is extremely boring due to the singular pace. The trinity test is pretty much the only point in the movie that doesn't move at a 100 miles an hour (and it looks really lame. I'm anti CGI, but when it's the centerpiece of the movie he can probably stretch that a tadbit). Fast pace doesn't mean the movie is good and somehow Nolan has convinced himself otherwise in these last two movie.

This movie is only above Tenet. It's nowhere near anything else, much less the best he's done. Maybe if the movie cut out the student section at the beginning and used that time to slow the movie down it might be alongside TDKR. Comparing this to Prestige/Inception/Interstellar is quite frankly insulting to good movie making.

I'm also really sick of Nolan having a ""puzzle piece"" in every movie to end it on. He's been doing it since what, the Prestige?",2023-07-22 21:41:45

"Social Network was not a character study movie, which showed Mark Zuckerberg’s personal issues or his conflicts. It just told how Facebook was born, with some elements of fiction incorporated in it. Comparison would’ve been fair if that movie was called “Zuckerberg” and explored further on to what happened with Mark’s life afterwards. Oppenheimer had it’s own set of problems with off pacing for 20-40 minutes at start of film and at times with sound mixing and scenes after scenes of what happened told through characters relentlessly talking, but whatever happened to him, really can’t be dumbed down. It would’ve worked better  as a TV series, to give the story some breathing room in between for audiences to not run around in their minds in between the scenes to get a grasp on everything that’s being said, but still it was a good film.",2023-07-25 18:17:12

"Totally - I loved the immediate silence, and the gym scene which really delved into the human horror of a nuclear attack, but the actual explosion itself, it seemed compressed and minuscule while all other aspects of the film felt so large; the performances, the sets, the frame, even the quanta felt massive.

I think the practical explosion to mimic the nuke was either a misstep or not performed to the best it could have been. Nothing about it felt more powerful than the ship full of explosives briefly shown exploding much earlier in the film.

Damn shame, but it’s my only real nit to pick with this one, and I could easily re-edit it myself with some other nuclear bomb footage - so no sweat!",2023-07-21 20:44:10

The scene where they were planning the attacks on Japan had a lot of impact for example, just as the speech from oppie after the bombings, it made me have chills all over my body and made me have a very unsettling feeling.",2023-07-24 10:50:28

First part showcased that a person is not useless just because they have some trouble.

Third part showcases how he was being lied to and being manipulated as the Nazi's were never close to building a bomb and wanted to focus on fission energy reactors and the Japanese were super close to surrendering, but they nuked them anyways.

> He just decided to take an hour detour, frantically jumping around timelines before abruptly tying things back together.

And it's completely unrealistic to think that one man's security clearance had any implications at all on the game theoretics of nuclear strategy between the US and USSR.

I honestly think this is the reason it has such a high rating; Nolan and his fanboys have built this mythology that questioning the movie equates to being stupid, or lacking in some kind of advanced literary analysis skills. I genuinely think people don’t understand movies like Tenet (because they are nonsensical), and rather than say, I didn’t get it or I couldn’t follow it, they use that as some weird evidence of Nolan’s superior genius.

"Thank you again for sharing the link. I did see the video, it's just I want to get more from their writing advice, but I'll read the article later.

I agree with you about Nolan's writing. I read long ago that someone describes his writing as ""checklist writing."" They said that his writings leave no room for breathing and that everything the characters do and say contributes to the plot. They don't do anything else besides moving the plot forward. In the end, you have very one-dimensional characters because the plot is more important.

"I do. Or more accurately, I disagree with how you’re applying it.

It’s a useful guideline for writing a story, just like the three act structure, Save the Cat, or the Hero’s Journey are. But if you use that guideline - or any guideline - as an inflexible lens for critically evaluating a story, then you might miss the “point” of why and how the story is being told.

It’s a bit like hearing George Orwell’s writing rules where he strongly advocates for terse, disciplined language, and then using that to dismiss J R R Tolkien as a bad writer.

I am US born and raised also. At this very moment I am less than a mile away from The World Trade Center. I actually didn’t feel that this movie directly countered what you were saying but I do think it speaks to that point to a degree. It seemed to me it was more about how Oppenheimer ushered in the nuclear age and the realizations about what comes with that. Which is why he kept speaking on creating regulations after. To me the biggest take away was the personal grief Oppy felt but it didnt scream “nukes are bad” imo. I can definitely see how you or anyone else could take it another way though.

That line is actually said during sex???? I assumed that was a funny joke. Wow,2023-07-21 13:56:25
">It’s insensitive to have that document in a sex scene to begin with but from a movie perspective I just don’t think it’s really true to the character who had alot of respect for Hinduism.

I think it was very intentional on Nolan's part because he's using the scene to establish a key part of Oppenheimer's character in it. A lot of the early film is dedicated to Oppenheimer wanting to put everything into context, like his initial statement to the oversight board or the way his understanding of communism was shaped by reading *Das Kapital* in German rather than English. But at the same time, he shows no comprehension of things like history and politics, and that's really what gets him into trouble. It never occurs to him that Strauss might hold a grudge because of the way Oppenheimer undermined him or how Kitty's association with the Communist Party could come back to haunt him two decades later. To him, Strauss is a natural ally because they work for the same organisation and their disagreement is purely intellectual, while Kitty's communist leanings do not matter because they happened so far back in the past.

The sex scene is important because Oppenheimer -- who is still quite young here -- is looking at the text as an object of intellectual curiosity. He sees reading something in Sanskrit as a challenge to be mastered first and foremost and doesn't see the religious undertones. If anything, he probably views it as poetry -- the *Baghavad Gita* is part of the *Mahabharata*, an epic poem not unlike the *Iliad* or *Odyssey* \-- considering that he is briefly seen with a copy of *The Hollow Men* early in the film. The point is that the scene is foreshadowing Oppenheimer's biggest flaw: he assumes everyone shares his ideals and so underestimates how their personal context influences their behaviour. He doesn't understand the more esoteric aspects of humanity that put that person into context.",2023-07-21 14:16:41

"I didn’t call the critics uneducated teenagers. I said that I wouldn’t expect an uneducated teenager to be very impacted.

I’m just explaining some of the dissent for anybody who may be put off by the “it’s just three hours of men in suits being mad at eachother and then a shitty explosion” bullshit",2023-07-26 19:27:02
To add to this we are also introduced to the idea Oppenheimer is incredibly smart.  He learns Dutch and gives a talk in the language in 6 weeks.  He is later shown as fluent in several other languages.,2023-07-27 02:05:17
[deleted],2023-07-29 02:24:31
That meeting was the AEC. One of Strauss's arguments for pursuing the hydrogen bomb was that Russia had all our Intel anyway because there was a spy at Los Alamos. Oppenheimer clings to the notion there was no spy because he's consumed with so much guilt he doesn't want nuclear warfare to advance any further. Every scene with Strauss is after the Manhattan Project,2023-08-20 07:10:46
"Oh yea, I feel like Oppenheimer's sound design was really the only thing that felt remotely IMAX or DA ""worthy"". Dune, just like Bladerunner has so many screenshot-worthy frames with a ""scale"" that'd be very hard to feel on a TV, much less so on a tablet or a phone.   


But I can see why some people may like Oppenheimer over Dune, Dune's presentation is much less ""energetic"" than a movie like Oppenheimer where there's music playing constantly in pretty much every scene, there's the ""puzzle piece"" aspect of it, the sound design and editing feels much more kinetic(?) compared to Dune where it feels like you're following Paul's slow journey into Arrakis.",2023-08-30 07:26:32
"My interpretation of the movie is that, during the whole film you feel like a bomb is going to explode, you just don't know when, and you're scared because you know it's going to be loud.  


Now imagine what people lived through during the cold war, knowing that it was just a matter of time a bomb would drop, and cause a chain reaction of bigger bombs, knowing it could end life as we know it.  


So, taking his security clearance away I think it's the point of it, it's important that the H bomb doesn't see light, because it can cause more destruction. We don't need it, war is over, then why are we arguing about making bigger bombs?  
The point of the movie is phlosophical

"I stand corrected. This is an actual source, which I didn't have for the time when the Berkeley scientists got the news.

I had read so much about the rapid dissemination by word of mouth—along the eastern seaboard—that I assumed it spread across the country the same way. I guess I overestimated the social connectivity across the continent at that time. (Weren't there long-distance phone calls? This is after telephone repeaters were common, though they were based on vacuum tubes.)

Meitner and Frish's conversation was on Christmas 1938. I also overestimated the time Bohr spent crossing the Atlantic: in that time, it would have taken about 4 days, not a month. It makes sense that it would be in a newspaper by Jan 29.

I'm still surprised they didn't get a phone call from a colleague earlier, but maybe the west coast scientists were more socially isolated by their geographic distance.",2023-07-25 02:00:02

"This is the most pretentious answer I can imagine, holy hell.  


The movie should be easy to follow whether you have a political science degree or not. It fails to be so and not because people turned off their brains or expected something with action. The movie does not put in the leg work to make any of the other scientist characters actual characters besides Teller/Strauss. 

And when I say easy to follow I don't mean ""I need simple english at all times and a pen through a folded piece of paper"". I mean ""I want to know who these people are and what they contributed and how much time is passing instead of just flying through literally every scene of the movie with reckless abandon giving the least amount of information as possible"".

I'm not talking about the different periods in Oppenheimers life, I'm saying that the first two acts did not properly show the passage of time during the Manhattan Project. There is no care and no sense of urgency given by the story because until Matt Damon says ""It's been 4 years"" they don't actually give you a frame of reference. The bowl with the marbles means nothing because we have no sense of time when it comes to the intervals between them.

This movie requiring multiple viewings is more of a flaw. It's based on the movies complete disinterest in informing the viewer on what is happening while having the fastest pace I have ever seen. It makes pure action movies like the Raid 2 blush. What makes repeat viewings great is seeing new layers based on revelations made near the end of the movie, not the movie failing to care to tell the audience even the bare minimum.",2023-07-22 23:06:47
You're right. Next time around I hope Nolan sends out a public service message before his movie releases. This movie is only to be viewed by people who can appreciate the art of history and cinema.

However I would argue that it is in fact an action movie. It's one of the most fast paced movies I've ever seen, and the soundtrack does not ever stop from being very loud and very intense.

Between the audio literally rumbling the seats and the massive screen that suffocated you with every atomic blast, I felt it brought a level of immersion worthy of seeing it in the theater. Certainly one that elevated it beyond the standard biopic and lended gravitas to the horrors resulting from his work. 

But in terms of screenplay, I could definitely see that. They covered many decades of his life in three hours, using the overlapping timelines to juggle it all, but it would probably be pretty effective conveyed more traditionally in a well produced show.",2023-07-30 09:17:17

Love him or hate him as a director, I see this complaint levied against most Nolan films and I couldn't find it further from the truth. Yes he loves parallel action and parallel timelines in his films, but he always frames them in easily digestible ways.",2023-07-22 16:53:23

"How often do we see things from anyone's perspective except Oppie? Any other movie would have just shown Kitty recoiling in some way. The idea of him being laid bare makes sense so I agree there, I just think it lingered too long and the way the actress.. performed just felt weird and disrespectful.",2023-07-22 03:41:10

"He was open to all kinds of ideas, not just communism. But communism was so derisive during that time period, everyone focused on that part of him. I'd say a lot of the movie showcased that.",2023-07-24 13:18:46
"There's the scene where Niels Bohr implores him to ""hear the music"" rather than just read the sheet as a metaphor for his approach to physics. It's after this that he becomes interested in modernist literature and art (Eliot and Picasso), the cause of the Spanish Civil War, etc. I think he needed to understand the revolutions happening in the worlds of art and politics in order to revolutionise physics in the same way.

His flirtations with the Communist Party before the war mainly came out of his sympathy for the Spanish Republic, and it's not hard to understand his aversion to fascism as a Jew who studied in Germany in the 1920s.",2023-07-24 14:53:18
"He only slept with 2 women in the movie, is that enough to call someone a womanizer ?",2023-07-24 12:05:32
"Agreed. We still have no idea what his motivations and drives were, we also didn't see the true emotional impact of the nukes on Japan that it has on Oppenheimer, we're just supposed to accept that he feels bad about his involvement, which changed his mind about developing the H Bomb.

The movie says and shows so much but at the end only about 5-10% of the scenes stay with you,",2023-07-24 08:44:13

"His dialogue is also one of the biggest problems I've been having with Nolan films. Not every line from a character's mouth needs to be some kind of a profound proverb, words of wisdom, or thinly veiled foreshadowing. Often characters in his films just don't feel real or personally relatable.",2023-07-24 22:04:42
"The movie already is way too much talking, constant talking of expositions of information upon information, often with no context given.

What the movie needs is more showing. Show me the actual result of the nuclear bombs dropped in Japan, show me how this directly affected Oppenheimer, show me why Oppenheimer is so driven, show me why the loss of his security clearance was such a blow to him, etc. 90% of the movie is literally the audience being told through conversations what went on and what's going on.

Nolan seems to have forgotten the fundamental rule of ""Show, don't tell"" of filmmaking.",2023-07-24 09:44:43
"Yeah. That moment took me a second. Teller's subtle indication that he wasn't quitting, then loudly asking to leave the conversation didn't immediately track with me.",2023-08-14 16:06:32
"I think that part is kind of lost by not ever stating what the Atomic Energy Commission was and how it ""influenced"" policy. I agree that the significance of the third act is about the country turning on a patriot because of communist ideals, but I don't think it was properly executed and the tension was broken because of the editing between the Strauss scenes and the Oppenheimer trial. I kind of found the whole film a bit confused in its pacing and I think it undercuts the theme of the film. Honestly hard to articulate on a first viewing but I just left feeling a bit meh to the whole thing",2023-07-21 04:52:08

"I hear you. I really wanted to see both a visual and audio culmination of that scene to capture the magnitude of the nature of the bomb though. Got a hint of that in the trailer and I think it built that expectation with me.

"It’s called “Oppenheimer” not “Trinity”. And the trailers clearly show RDJ saying “Truman wants to know what’s next”, the last trailer opened with them meeting about the Soviets nuclear test, and also Branagh chastising Oppenheimer saying “you gave the world the power to destroy itself”.",2023-07-22 07:30:55

"It was very clear they were seeing each other consistently; she kept booty calling him and despite not wanting to make it happen her kept turning up 'I'll also reply'

Then he knocked up Kitty accidentally, so had to get married with her, thus the heart to heart sat at the bed; doors opening/closing; he shows his philosophical outlook and within that is an attitude of wanting his cake and eating it, the selfishness

She calls him again in an hour of need, he goes to her, gets in trouble

He ignores her, she 'kills herself', he's distraught because he didn't help, he is accused of acting like a martyr by kitty because he left that door open, he brought it upon himself.

Theres a tidy parallel there with the A / H bomb story

Her story was complete, we didn't need anymore that we got out of their relationship.",2023-07-26 23:27:48

"The problem I had with this movie was that Nolan would introduce creative ideas, and then wouldn’t follow through with them. 

The scene with him and his communist mistress on the chair at the inquiry? Brilliant. He should have done more of that. “Did you have communist contacts?” That would have been the ideal time to have the images of all the communist friends he turned from in his past in the room behind him! 

But no, instead we get blurred shaky cam and a close up of Oppenheimer’s face.

And this lack of consistency is all over this film. It was a decent enough biopic. I just wish people would think about it a little more critically before pulling this “OMG GIVE NOLAN THE OSCAR NOW!!!!” talk.",2023-07-22 01:29:35
"The movie was very fast paced, switching perspectives rapidly and building suspense. It was about an event that we have now agreed defined a new moment in the Earth's history in a relatable way about the human impacts of that moment. Personal preferences based on personal lack of interest is one thing, but this film is far from ""boring"" in any objective sense.",2023-07-22 14:50:56

Also it could be a deliberate choice to show it even though Oppenheimer did not witness it. That would've had carried so much weight and be very meaningful.",2023-07-30 06:52:14
"Who gives a shit about Oppenheimer. We all assumed this would be a movie about the development of the bomb at Los Alimos and oak ridge and the bombing in Japan. Fuck Oppenheimer and fuck biopics. 

The history channel had a 1 hour documentary they made in the 90s about this that has so much more content this this dogshit. 

They could have included more about the development of the physics. The letter to FDR. Oak ridge. The fact that we used 10% of the power in America at oak ridge to make the material. The technical issues of making the fuel. The scientists that died in accidents. The Enola gay pilots and their prep. The bombs being transported on the Indianapolis. The actual bombings and the surrender of the Japanese. Truman being briefed on the project post fdr death.. I could go on an on. This movie should have written itself. Instead we got some film about a whiney bitch and some bad sex scenes and a bunch of boring meetings about communists. Like who gives a shit. Movie was about as exciting as my Monday morning meetings.",2023-07-30 09:20:30
I don’t think you could capture the nuances of all the decisions and emotions of the people in Oppenheimer’s life after the bombing in 10 minutes. Those instances shown where the most important/consequential people in Oppenheimer’s life had to decide or had already decided whether to defend or attack his character were enthralling.,2023-07-22 02:31:17

Also, this is a biopic of Oppenheimer and the removal of his security clearance was a pivotal moment in his life.  We were also able to see his change of views on nuclear weaponry and their use against people in conflicts. The whole third act is Oppenheimer dealing with the consequences of his creation.",2023-07-22 02:15:02

"That's literally how it happened in real life. The timing and success of the bombing were treated as classified info so Groves, who was in Washington, refused to inform Oppenheimer about the attack. Oppenheimer learned via the radio.",2023-07-23 15:54:19
"Well said, the movie felt so overwhelming after the bomb sequence. Too many dialogues and a trial that didn’t create any interest in me.",2023-07-23 08:12:25
"Nolan’s timelines are often not linear. It’s not for everyone as some people can have trouble following it, but it’s not entirely unexpected from him.

How thrilling do you think building the atomic bomb can be? The Trinity test scene as the climax of all the theory, now I thought that was thrilling. Other than the test scene, it’s all physics, math, science, theory. What more can they add to make it “thrilling”? Things that didn’t happen? Again, I think people were expecting the avengers because they heard a bomb might be involved, when it was a period piece, biopic about a politically divisive scientist no less. I don’t blame the movie or the trailers. Agree to disagree!",2023-07-23 08:21:50
"Since you asked before your edit... I honestly have no idea where the movie began, it was so disjointed. My guess is it began with a black and white scene of RDJ in a courtroom after the Windows 95 screensaver graphics of stars and atoms. Why did they start with what appeared to be a bunch of men in their 30s in college who were into science? No idea. Bad directing maybe?",2023-07-23 16:55:33

"She picks up the book because she is fascinated by the idea that Oppenheimer can read Sanskrit and idolizes him.  She does open it to a random page but the movie takes convenient artistic license in having it be the very page with the famous quote. It’s an important scene that shapes Oppenheimer’s view of himself through the perceived influence he felt he had on those around him. Oppenheimer secretly desires to be viewed as a great historic martyr. The man who can destroy the world but is sad about the weight placed on him. And he relishes the notion of Pugh’s character perceiving him in this grand and tragic light.

And of course the scene has some on the nose foreshadowing of Oppenheimer eventually destroying Pugh’s character’s world.",2023-08-03 12:30:31

Well I haven't read the book it's based off so I can't say for certain but not including the horrors of who the atomic bomb ACTUALLY affected regardless of the source material is not only dishonest but also disingenuous.

We always criticize other countries when they don't own up to their horrors like China with the Tiananmen Square incident and Germany with the Holocaust. Yet here we are, letting our directors save face with the bombs we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by barely acknowledging the incident in a film that's going to be seen by hundreds of millions of people.

It shows Oppenheimer as a conflicted, confused, contradictory, shiftless person who isn’t able to keep his moral compass aligned with his desire to have a place in history. But neither does it downplay the magnitude or importance of what he and his team achieved. If you came away thinking the film wants us to think “poor Oppenheimer” then I think you deeply misunderstand the film.

I think the third act was the movie’s most important. It shows how complex an individual Oppenheimer was through the eyes of those who knew him best, whether friend or adversary. And it shows that Oppenheimer himself struggled to define and defend his own worldviews.",2023-08-03 12:23:13

All of the plot’s various thematic elements are resolved in the third act. It’s vital to the movie’s themes and message.

"It still needs to work in a movie. I got the feeling Nolan was torn between creating a drama and a documentary. The volume of content he was trying to capture (college, traveling, Manhattan project, post-WWII world, trial, political life, love life, etc.) was just too much for a drama. But he also added too much to each scene for it to be a documentary. Similar to Tenet, it became a movie of pieces. Each piece was given a soaring orchestra moment, or a quippy line of dialogue, or a surprising reveal (""I acutally hated Oppenheimer!""). And when every moment is big in itself, the whole thing becomes stale. 

Nolan did well during the bomb test. The music swelled. There was a big build up. This moment was treated with respect. Everyone in the theater paid attention. Well done to that scene. The rest of the movie, especially the end, not so much",2023-07-22 18:43:39

I don't think nudity was strictly necessary, but there's nothing more silly to me than watching sex scenes where women are wearing bras. If the actress isn't willing to do a nude scene, then film it creatively so the passion is conveyed and no nudity is shown. That would have been fine also.

"Yes! Agree with a lot of what you’re saying 

What annoyed me most about the non-linear story telling is they often didn’t reveal character motivations until the end so it hard to get invested when it’s not clear why things are happening. Yes that worked amazingly in Memento but the whole movie is about memory loss so that was a fantastic device in that context. When they’d repeat scenes like Einstein at the lake or Oppenheimer talking about isotopes at a hearing I think you’re supposed to have a big AHA moment in a cool way like in The Prestige when the entire movie changes once you know the twist. But in Oppenheimer it falls flat for me. The Prestige is already great even without that twist and then finding it out takes the movie to a whole other level. In Oppenheimer not knowing certain character motivations until the last 30 minutes or so makes it all very confusing.

The sex scene with the famous quote was so cringe worthy I couldn’t believe it was happening. It’s one of my favourite quotes of all time in the context of Oppenheimer saying it and there are so many cooler ways it could have been used. 

Tenet has got better with me on multiple viewings as once you understand what’s happening there is some great action. It’s let down though by some weird lines for the main female character (another Nolan weakness) and John David Washingtons character is never that compelling. Robert Pattinson is excellent. It felt like there was a top tier 5 star movie there if it had been edited better with a tighter script. 

What will be interesting for me with Oppenheimer on rewatch is if I can watch the whole thing or if as I suspect I’ll skip some parts.",2023-08-04 15:36:58

Maybe you didn't need a loud bang but I would have loved something also creeping along like the sound of flames burning, have a couple of seconds of silence before the shockwave because the sound design was master class up to that point. The parts whenever something was being visualized, the thuds of pieces of a machine shooting out, all great. The bomb itself while I can see working for many others felt kinda underwhelming even after the shockwave when the rest of the movie's sound design and editing prior was already a 10/10.

"My interpretation was that he wanted to be in a position to help guide and influence the future of bombs and its use in our society.  Losing his clearance kept him isolated from the scientific community, which trickled into scientists in general being kept out of politics and key decision-making, and more easily allowed for bigger and more destructive bombs to be created.",2023-07-24 22:38:35

"My interpretation (at least from the film) is the hearing on his security clearance, while seemingly fairly basic at first, in effect becomes a criminal trial on Oppenheimer and his links to communist associates. Stauss wants him labelled as a traitor in the press. He was a celebrity figure after the war, and the result of the hearing, in effect, completely tarnishes his reputation. The hearing was national news after all, and this is represented in the film by the second TIME magazine cover. 

The film points out that links to communism results in you having difficulty gaining trust and finding work, as displayed by his Communist brother now labouring in railway construction.

IIRC there are actually very few scenes with Oppenheimer after that timeline after the security clearance appeal is denied. The timeline has a heavy focus on Strauss at this point onwards, with the exception of the final scene with Oppo and Einstein, which is set some years earlier. Maybe that’s also representing a momentary fall from the limelight. The next timeline we see from Oppo, he is in the far future accepting awards.",2023-07-24 23:56:03

"Well, let's see. He was originally trying to stop the Nazis from committing genocide on Jews. So right off the bat, you can see why he'd want to put a stop to that, seeing as how Oppenheimer was Jewish.


When that ended up being a moot point with Hitler's suicide, his efforts led to Japan's surrender and probably saved millions of lives. Not to mention that Japan committed some of the worst atrocities in the war and killed far more innocent civilians than the atomic bombs. Oh, plus they did murder 2,400 Americans without provocation to kick the whole thing off.


All that being said, I think they downplayed his heroism quite a bit.",2023-07-22 22:45:47

"i know this is supposed to be more of a movie about oppenheimer and not just about ""an explosion"" (as some people have said in this thread), but the trinity test is one of the biggest aspects of oppenheimer's life.  yet, the movie made the actual bomb test sequence kind of feel like an after thought.  

the movie was paced / edited in kind of a jumbled way, so what could have been a better anxious / emotional build up was lost.  by the time you get to the actual test, you feel like you've just been spun around a couple times and are kind of disoriented because everything is moving at a breakneck pace.  i genuinely feel like they tried to fit way too much into a 3 hour movie.  they could have *just* focused on los alamos (with some flashbacks prior) to give a greater sense of build up to the trinity explosion.  

also, from a purely spectacle standpoint - you could tell practical effects were used to emulate the test bomb.  it was underwhelming.  i prefer practical effects for the most part, but in this case, it felt like i was watching some rednecks throw a flare onto a bonfire that was doused with gasoline as compared to the first test of the most destructive weapon man has ever created.  it really took the wind out of the sails in terms of making it impactful.  and i don't even care if that was a more ""realistic"" depiction - i'm at the movies to be fucking entertained.  go nuts. or at least, more nuts than that.  

that said, i did like the delayed audio arrangement.",2023-07-22 16:45:32

"We got only two quick scenes post-bomb of Oppenheimer experiencing this surreal guilt. I sort of...wanted more than that. For as tortured as he see him, we only have those two moments (during the address in Los Alamos where he envisions the face melting and the charred body and then once in the boardroom where the nuclear light begins to bleed into the room) where we *feel* that guilt instead of just seeing him feeling guilty. We also keep cutting to Strauss and his attempting to gain a Cabinet position as if he's a main character despite his arc not having much affect on the rest of the story. Sure, he set the dominoes in motion for Oppenheimer to be trialed for being a communist, but I don't really care about *how/why* he was investigated. The mere fact that he was investigated and we see how he feels about that is plenty enough. It's one thing to see someone be sad in a room. It's another to be placed in his POV and see what he's envisioning, and that's so much more impactful.

I'm reminded of the Barbie movie where they outright tell you, ""Don't think about it too hard"" when they talk about how to get to Barbieland because in the end, the how doesn't really matter, it's the effects and events afterwards that matter. Similarly, I don't care that RDJ's character had Oppenheimer investigated, so it just bugged me that we spent so much time on a plotline that ultimately went nowhere, especially for someone we see interact with Oppenheimer all of twice. Even if that's the point that some random moment sealed his fate, it's still not entertaining or interesting.",2023-07-24 21:10:47

"But the “personal statements” you see actually happened. A lot of the dialogue is from transcripts or quotes. 

The only fiction I can recall is Oppenheimer imagining the audience as victims of the bombings. Everything else is spot on.

The point of the movie isn’t for him to be redeemed. It’s to show how Strauss went after him due to a personal vendetta. 

The only “redemption” I can think of is Oppenheimer realizing the atomic bomb was a tragedy and not wanting the h-bomb to be made. Both of which are historically accurate.",2023-07-21 16:24:07
"I really don’t believe you’re correct here - A. In the hearings they straight up call him out on the fact that his “morality” came into play only after he’d created the bomb - which he clearly realizes is correct after the scene B. Kitty tells him he will not be absolved just because of his guilt C. Strauss goes on a full monologue about how Oppenheimer would’ve done it all again if he could - due to his egotism. The last act of the movie presents a very clear case that despite Oppenheimers crisis of conscience, and there’s nuance here, but despite it all - he did this and he can’t put the genie back in the bottle just because he feels bad about it in retrospect. It shows a man reconciling with who he truly is and what he’s done due to his hubris, which is a development that may doom the entirety of humanity.

Strauss (RDJ’s character) wanted to end Oppenheimer after his talk with Einstein and when Oppenheimer humiliated him after the hearing on isotopes. Also the movie was titled “Oppenheimer” not nuclear bombs. It was a biopic on his life and what happened. Strauss was instrumental in Oppenheimers demise and it was said after he got his clearance removed that Oppenheimer was never the same. Also Strauss was never a random person bro he was a prominent politician who rose through the ranks in Washington even during the times when the city was pretty anti Semitic and was only the eight cabinet nominee to be rejected at that time.,2023-07-25 00:15:44

"Not the person who replied to you, but while he was hardly a paragon of moral clarity, he wasn’t spineless either. First, though you could argue this was partially ego driven, he did take moral responsibility for the bomb (arguably even too much moral responsibility, given that he was ultimately a cog in the national security machine. An important cog, but a cog nonetheless). This shows at least some willingness to own what he did, whereas a thoroughgoing coward would have disclaimed responsibility (“just following orders” etc.). Second, he did do a number of things in service of his beliefs despite the fact that it exposed him to a great deal of personal and professional risk: associating with communists, covering for friends, advocating for non-proliferation. Again, not really the behavior of a thoroughgoing coward.

Third, him not standing up for himself is I think better interpreted as self-punishment for his guilt over creating the bomb—in fact this is the interpretation explicitly stated by his wife. It’s not so much cowardice as a misguided attempt at penitence.",2023-08-06 05:27:59

Lewis Strauss was upset that Oppenheimer was opposed to the hydrogen bomb/had made a fool out of him in the earlier hearing, so he and Nichols conspired to damage Oppenheimer's credibility so that he wouldn't have any ability to influence policy. They are quite clear about making this a closed door hearing so that Oppenheimer doesn't have a platform. They also mention that it's basically a kangaroo court and the deck is stacked against him no matter what he does. Only Kitty manages to effectively stand up to Robb.

They were both on the same page, fully aware that the use of the bomb would kill tens if not hundreds of thousands of people.

It seems monstrous and I’m sure we’d all like to believe we were better people than that, but how could you possibly know for sure without being in that situation. It’s terrifying.

A visual effects shot is one that just contains effects that are not practical. Gollum is a CG character, so a shot with Gollum and Frodo is a VFX shot.  A fully CG shot of Gollum falling into lava is also a VFX shot.",2023-07-22 03:47:52

"I think part of the point was that these people were so wrapped up in their own drama that they viewed much of it through the lens of their own lives and what could happen to them/the things that matter to them, while ignoring the actual victims. Like how Kyoto gets saved purely because one powerful guy had a good vacation there. That’s one of the chilling things about this part of history. The hypocrisy of Oppenheimer himself and his waffling about his “moral concerns” was at the heart of one of the most intense scenes in the film.

Tbh, I don’t think having a bunch of Japanese characters showing up for a single scene and essentially serving as a visual device would have necessarily been the most respectful thing either. There can be (and already are) movies that actually show the real human effects of the war and the various bombings, and what makes those (like for example grave of the fireflies, though it’s about the firebombings of Tokyo and not Hiroshima/Nagasaki) so haunting is that the characters are actually deep and humanized, not just glorified extras added into one sequence to heighten emotional impact. And I think Nolan probably realized that it would take a whole movie of its own to do the bombings themselves justice.

I think the scene with Oppenheimer and his wife after he found out that Jean had killed herself was a perfect encapsulation of the whole thing. Something along the lines of “You don’t get to sin and expect everyone else to pity you when there are consequences”",2023-07-26 02:50:17
"The thing is you're asking for more visualisation than there already was. We saw the effect it had on them in a truly haunting scene but you want the audience to be desensitized with a whole scene of them suffering?

I loved Ludwig's Mando score and he definitely did Oppenheimer justice and then some, fantastic score. Knowing now that it wasn't Zimmer composing, I can already remember a few unique moments that stuck out to me as not as Zimmer-esque but the vibe was perfect.

I've not been crazy about political readings of Nolan's work in the past, more so because I think his films, though they do present situations, leave more up to the viewer so it's hard to say ""Oh this movie is saying this!"" But for sure this film's depiction of the USA was pretty cynical and I think it brought to light both the injustice of Oppenheimer's persecution and also the negative consequences of WW2 of which Oppenheimer's bomb was one of the biggest.

I think that's exactly why we don't see any of the problem-solving that happened during Manhattan Project.

"Discussions of the Manhattan Project tend to focus on a few scientists and theoretical work rather than the actual engineering, either of the plants that were used to get the material that made the weapons possible or the weapons themselves (explosive lens designs for implosion etc.)

This is arguably due in large part to intentional moves by the US government from the beginning of the project going public - the scientific/theoretical aspects were more available, and they didn't want to discuss technical details of, say, uranium enrichment at all to avoid the soviets (and later Iran, North Korea, etc.) learning lessons it took billions of dollars to learn - the Smyth Report which was the immediate postwar public account of the project had next to no technical detail other than a single reference to xenon poisoning in reactors which was edited out after the first few printings (source: https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/08/01/what-bohr-told-beria/ ), instead focusing entirely on general theories in physics which were already public knowledge.

Hmm. That's interesting. I used to see that effect in older films. Mainly from the 80s and 90s. It was an effect that could be done without CG so it was done to simulate thunder and stuff. So I just thought Chris was using that effect since it was a good practical effect that's also effective. Definitely could be interpreted as the representation of an atomic bomb going off.,2023-08-19 06:15:00

"Haha pretty much his vibe. He was excellent in the show Mr Robot, where he plays a social anxiety filled, depressed, paranoid computer hacker (there's more but that would go into spoilers). He also won an Oscar portraying (some would say badly) Freddie Mercury, and his most recent biggest role of note was the villain in No Time to Die, the last Bond movie. I dig him as an actor but it's interesting he took a role with such limited screen time (although he obviously gets a huge scene in the last 20 minutes).",2023-07-22 23:20:04

I agree with you. There should have been 15-20 minutes more to let the information heavy dialogue and incessant character namedropping breathe. One should read up some stuff before watching for better enjoyment. 9/10,2023-07-21 09:06:26

"Einstein was renowned for his development of special and general relativity, as well as other developments in statistical mechanics and the photoelectric effect. While his paper on the photoelectric effect was important to the development of quantum mechanics, it took him awhile to accept the conclusions of later developments in QM as the theory became more developed. Thus for awhile in the 30's and 40's he was seen as being behind the times.

It's also perhaps worth mentioning that his political views and in particular his critique of capitalism did not endear him to the US government, so some of his diminished reputation may have been retaliatory.",2023-07-24 15:07:24
"Look up the Einstein-Bohr debates: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03793-2

Basically, Einstein heavily criticized what has come to be known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physicists that Neil Bohr and most physicists took as the conclusive interpretation of reality. This was taken by the younger scientists as a sign that Einstein himself had become outdated and out of touch with their modern sensibilities and CI became the leading theory for the next sixty or so years. 

In the last twenty or so years however there has been a lot more criticism of the CI now that the original young scientists of that era are now old men and dying off, and a new appreciation for Einstein's criticism. It also helps that several additional theories of Einstein which were non-provable with the technology of the time have now proven correct, especially regarding black holes and gravity waves.",2023-07-24 18:52:26

"When you contextualize this with the fact that Truman only became president after FDR died, it makes the scene even more interesting. I think Truman's reaction has more to do with free will and determinism as it does personal responsibility and duty.

Truman wasn't ""supposed"" to be president but when FDR died he was called up and ended up being the one to have to make the choice about dropping the atomic bomb. I get the sense that he thought of this as him assuming his duty — even if it came with a tremendous amount of guilt.

Oppenheimer also assumed his duty and was initially passionate about serving his country and beating the Nazis. When the target changed, Oppenheimer began to change.

Truman and Oppenheimer are kind of similar in this way, only Truman reacted as a ""man,"" whilst Oppenheimer reacted as a ""cry baby."" I think that's what annoyed Truman so much about him and why he cut the meeting short.

Perhaps he was hoping to meet with someone who he could share his sense of masculinity and duty with, but instead he got someone who was riddled with guilt and shame, something with which Truman could not relate to.",2023-07-24 18:43:30
It’s borderline narcissistic for Oppenheimer to have felt the responsibility fell solely on him.,2023-07-21 13:49:39
"Does it? It could be that Truman wanted to bury his own guilt deep down and Oppenheimer put a mirror up to Truman's feelings in a public setting. So Truman reacted with anger and immediately ended the meeting so he didn't have to reveal his true emotions about it. We're talking about my grandpa's generation here. Men back then did not often reveal their emotional vulnerability publicly. Scratch that, they still don't.",2023-07-22 04:31:58
That's one of the parts of the movie that sticks with you. Once the process is in motion it takes on the feel of a slowly moving freight train. No one is really making decisions. Oppie says to Ravi that they have no choice and it's literally true. You 100% have to stop the nazis from getting the bomb first. There is no choice to be made.,2023-07-21 14:59:04
"I mean, I think that makes a lot of sense. We have decades of discussion about nuclear weapons, their morality, an entire arms race, concerns about radiation poisoning, etc, but back then it was just a new type of weapon. Cities were already being leveled by air raids during the war - what difference did it make if it takes a thousand bombs or a single one?",2023-07-21 20:57:56
"as opposed to the alternative, which was an invasion of japan, I think he preferred the bomb.",2023-07-21 09:09:48
"Nobody in America knew what the Japanese were thinking or what the Soviets were thinking. A lot of this is just benefit of hindsight. All Truman knew was that the Japanese fought tooth and nail on every island in the Pacific so far. They didn't surrender after tens of thousands of civilians perished in Tokyo, so they likely wouldn't surrender if tens of thousands more died in a last ditch defense of the home islands. And that if the invasion of Japan was just as bloody as Okinawa, it would be a slaughter on both sides. The atomic bomb was an attempt at shocking the Japanese into surrender. They didn't scrap the plans for a land invasion if it came to that, and there was no guarantee that the Japanese would surrender even after two atom bombs.

Even with modern social media, Twitter, Telegram, and more, we still struggle to understand what Putin and the decision makers in Russia are really thinking.",2023-07-22 04:36:06
This simply isn't true historically. The movie attempts to capture how people thought at that time. Japan was a Blackbox. We didn't know what they were thinking bc they didn't allow people to have access to that. We assumed they wouldn't surrender and let's remember when the emperor tried to surrender there was an attempted coup against him. The Japanese even said a complete victory or they would die fighting. It's a common misunderstanding that Japan was about to surrender.,2023-07-22 02:14:47

"My apologies, in my field the strong force is usually referred to as the color force. I just meant strong as an adjective, which I see now is really confusing so I edited my previous comment.

Yes you are right the fundamental force behind it is electromagnetism, but it isn’t friction but rather the Pauli exclusion principle that prevents the atoms from interacting. Since electrons form an electron cloud around their nucleus, other atoms cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously because they share the same spin value. This will create friction in the end but that is the effect, not the cause.

Funnily enough the force that governs nuclear decay is actually the weak force. The strong force binds quarks together, and also creates new ones if there is sufficient energy.",2023-07-22 19:59:46
"You need to take differential equations, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra to understand the “relatively simple” bra|ket notation introduced by Paul Dirac.

I’m not saying the explosion needed to be the ending, but I definitely felt more invested in the project and how Oppenheimer dealt with it psychologically than the story about his reputation. Again, I think every portion of the movie is well done (and the themes on self importance were intriguing), but it wasn’t a linear story structure and I feel like it may have been better served having the resolution after the bomb feel a bit tighter. Just how I felt watching it.",2023-07-24 15:48:42
[wipes uranium foam on passing piece of pie],2023-07-30 22:17:31
Yeah I can not argue more with that statement. You are very right a lot of the film is purposeful and yeah if Nolan was trying to hint that it was Jean who he felt a spark and she was the actual love of his life and wanted to share that moment with her instead of his wife it kinda makes sense? But as a south asian person whose British. I am not even that religious but it definitely was icky and could have been much better handled.,2023-08-01 23:25:04

"Just seen it and sadly I have to agree. I had the exact same problem with Dunkirk, where his insistence on using practical effects only meant that the film looked absolutely nothing like how the battle of Dunkirk looked. (Where was the AA fire blackening the sky, where were the armada of ships, the hundreds of thousands of me, the burning town and docks behind them?)

The Trinity test worked a little better in Oppenheimer, but it still did not look much like the real Trinity test. However I did like his use of silence and the flash before the shockwave hit. It did not have half the impact of the same event as shown in that astonishing episode of Twin Peaks: The Return.",2023-07-23 22:19:33
"I agree, but I he achieved that early image of the blast going off in Oppie’s mind and it was incredible. I was hoping to see more of that footage but was very let down when it was only a small fire ball",2023-07-31 05:21:48

"Yeah, I think my ultimate takeaway wasn’t a particular political viewpoint (although it is definitely Nolan’s most political movie and was way more sympathetic to the left than I *ever* expected from him) so much as it was “humanity is intrinsically flawed and should not have this power.”

Which is honestly pretty surprising from a guy that made a relatively uncritical-of-the-concept Batman trilogy",2023-07-21 20:18:40

He was a complete dick to Oppenheimer on the (false) notion that Oppenheimer was being a complete dick to him. Which speaks to his character in a very different way.,2023-07-21 07:17:48
They also kind of did a disservice to Truman. Cuz Truman was the one who ultimately pulled the trigger on the bomb and likely felt all the responsibility of their deaths and was right to call Oppenheimer out on it. The film just emotionally played it differently though making Truman seem unsympathetic to what he had done.,2023-07-22 07:10:25

I agree that there’s no need to stan for Nolan just off of his name alone, but the rushed, jerky nature of some of these elements to me were more about Oppenheimer’s uneasy mental state than poor execution.

They intentionally made the film to be not universally acceptable, and very biased, avoid any criticism but still present this as a 5 starred universally accepted film that illustrates a significant part of a human history and it is forever printed that way in a human history and no one ever question about it. It is portrayed as heroic, when there’s nothing peaceful about a war or weapons. It is very immoral. It is dangerously influential how the world might view such sensitive topics of a nuclear weapon and a war. It is very easy to motivate or brainwash people to a war because they cherrypick only the part of a history as a propaganda, dismissing the long whole history, a hidden background or an equal human right.

People who take this very lightly was never involved in such an event nor was a victim. Any human life shouldn’t be taken lightly or neglected.

But the movie ends with Oppenheimer saying to Einstein that their theory that the atomic bomb would engulf and inflame the entire world, that he believes they actually succeeded. Meaning not that the bomb literally engulfed the world, but that the power in the hands of humans would eventually lead to it's destruction. That's how it ended.

Here is a man who on the forefront of quite a few areas in physics such as black hole theory pre WW2; then having his whole life consumed with the atomic bomb via Manhattan Project and beyond

A man who was able to assemble the better part of the most influential physicists and chemists and biologists to one site for the war effort; whose decision to house Trinity was bases on his own personal affiliation with the Los Alamos region

A man who had significant communist ties, sure like others, but was the figure head of the Atomic project. Other scientists were involved, but he was like the Steve Jobs of the Manhattan Project in a way, the public face of it all after the fact. 

A man who then had intense regret as to how the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings werent the end; rather the beginning. A man who tried to advocate against Hydrogen bomb creation and testing but then was torn down by his own government for that - only to have some partial salvation near the end of his life 

At the end of the day he was the face of the atomic bombs for better or worse, and someone who is both so multifaceted, and yet by sources difficult to also read. Makes for a very interesting character that leads to many philosophical discussions",2023-07-29 04:52:58

A pseudo-intellectual wannabe movie critic take is valuing a visual effect being practical over it being good or fitting for what the film promised.

It's almost as if some parts can feel overly hand-holding and other parts can feel underexplained to some people and depending on the parts that can cause different reactions in people and different people can have different opinions about the same parts.

Most people here understand that but you seemingly don't. You, for some reason, felt the need to turn someone's plain old thoughts on the movie into something for you to ridicule and mock. The takes you decided to attack were so boring and bog standard for a Nolan film too. You must truly be the utmost level of fanboy or just a generally sad person.

also there WAS a scene in the film where Oppenheimer sees images of the destruction and aftermath wreaked by his bombs (the images themselves aren't shown on screen, but again I don't think they really needed to be - the focus is on how Oppenheimer reacts to it, and it's assumed that the audience is familiar anyway)

it's a character study biopic about the man J. Robert Oppenheimer, not a Project Manhattan history lesson",2023-07-27 20:34:25

I think the point of two was to make it clear that the US has more than one of these insane weapons and was more than willing to keep dropping them until an unconditional surrender. Two showed they had developed multiples of the weapon — in hopes it would sway them to surrender,2023-07-25 02:25:48

Y’all see headlines and who wrote it but never read the contents inside. 10 seconds TikTok attentions. As long as it’s written by someone famous it’s all good 😂 Bully everyone that’s not famous and neglect them.

First of all why don’t you return the indigenous Native Americans land to themselves? (Oh they don’t barely exist anymore.) Why do you have an arrogance to call yourself “a hero”?
If Palestinian don’t deserve to live in Israel because US says it was originally Jewish people’s land, why do you still deserve to live in America?

You mean Europeans colonized the world over 500+ years and japan needed to be stopped after a few years where US directed and tricked everyone into doing so

Many things mentioned are on the textbooks, government records etc as well (Samurai period, Japan’s isolation, Western threats, Black boat and treaties, militarization, Opium and other wars, WWII, Aid Raid casualties etc) and I added extra links. Japanese people knows the history in Japan. If you say the “national isolation of Japan” didn’t happen, it’s like you’re saying the sun doesn’t exist. You just don’t know absolutely nothing. Simple stupidity. And whatever is better than the “textbooks,” “TV shows,” “Oppenheimer” or your porn movies you watch 😂 The source of information the gov owns or buys is reliable? and I’m 10000% sure you didn’t read or understood NOTHING at all even this movie. Not even to mention you have zero knowledge about Japan but all the brainwashed materials. You gave up on researching anything regarding it on your own and deny everything just because you didn’t like the links posted here is hilarious.

Your god justifies unreasonable slaveries, murders and all the illogical things he does so I hope he will help you.

You needed to stop what you started 😂 While Japan was completely a closed country and you threatened Japan, force opened it, tricked and have been stealing every indigenous people’s land around the world, doing everything you can to create a reason to make everyone “evil” to justify colonization.

You don’t even think anyone is a human being except your own people.

You are nothing but a brainwashing invader

Cause everyone has their opinion. My parents would say the same for Infinity War while it might givr goosebumps to me.,2023-07-21 16:28:26
"I’m seeing 2 types of criticisms:

Category 1 is related to plot related criticisms. I don’t find these to be compelling criticisms since the movie stuck to the biography pretty closely. So it’s pretty silly, for example, to complain about the inclusion of Strauss’ story line, when that was a substantial portion of the book. And telling that aspect of Oppie’s story is very important due to the historical and political ramifications that Oppie not having a say in America’s nuclear weapons policy (i.e. being opposed to the hydrogen bomb and an advocate of Bohr’s vision of an “open world” to avert an arms race) going forward had on geopolitics. I think it is also an important point about how engulfing the “Red Scare” was and how many politicians mishandled that. The fact that the man who led this enormous scientific project was completely ostracized from any decision making on his (and all of the scientist’s) creation, is significant and has ramification to this day. Just look at how divorced DoD decision making is from science, along with many other aspects of our politics and regulations. There exists to this day a level of mistrust between many scientists and government/military officials that partially stems from all of this. 

Category 2 related to criticisms of artistic and storytelling choices that Nolan made. I think many of these are valid and vary from person to person. 

I’ve read 2 biographies on the guy, a few other books on other physicists (Feynman, Fermi, Einstein) and the Manhattan project, have a graduate STEM degree, am from NM etc. so I found the storytelling to complement the biography well. However, in my opinion, some of the loud music was unnecessary at times, as was the first Bhagavad Gita quote during the sex scene. Just my 2 cents.",2023-07-21 18:36:03

"Thanks for the correction, I'm looking forward to seeing the movie",2023-08-08 02:19:36
I'm not sure that's entirely right. I think the general consensus is the Japanese were likely to surrender after the first bomb but were grappling with their cultural issues around shame and the emporor which is whybit took a while,2023-08-08 12:25:24
"It’s more the delivery of it, through the story. Yes we all knew nuclear war is bad. But it was seeing it through his view at that moment",2023-08-10 00:51:05

"Idk, it’s subjective? 

If Nolan wanted to use CGI he would have. He clearly didn’t want to because it didn’t fit his vision for the film. 

We can sit here and say “he shoulda done this, or done that” but I don’t think Nolan cares. 

He’s probably not sitting around wondering “how do I please my audience the most?”",2023-07-23 04:47:23

Trying to rush out this entire side plot where Oppenheimer's credibility is being ruined, despite the fact it's being presented in a movie sympathising with him, made by Christopher Nolan in one of the biggest movies of the year, is a little ironic.",2023-11-27 14:52:53

What the Wehrmacht did to the Russians was appalling, what the Japanese did to all of their prisoners of war goes beyond that.

"I feel like the lead up to the Trinity explosion was great. The tension was built perfectly which is why the actual explosion itself was a let down. There was a flash of light and then it sort of just zoomed in on sections of the explosion and then other people’s faces so it never felt like you got the full scale. I honestly would have preferred they just used retouched footage of the (actual explosion)[https://youtu.be/wki4hg9Om-k] . Still keep the silence because that’s how actual sound travels and then hit the theater with the sound from the blast. The actual explosion itself felt almost quiet when compared to people stomping their feet later in the movie. In fact with how loud they made other aspects like his anxiety I expected them to really go for the impact from the explosion.

I did enjoy the movie a lot but couldn’t help but feel let down at that one integral moment **because** the film did such a good job of setting my expectations high.",2023-07-22 11:21:08

"We see close up shots of the test in the movie for most of the scene, there was one very short wide angle view if I'm remembering correctly. This is to hide the fact that this is just a gasoline explosion, which looks different from an atomic explosion. Take Joan Hinton's account from viewing the test, which describes seeing colors of blue and purple, and we also don't see the stark contrast difference from bottom to top. 

""It was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light. We were bathed in it from all directions. The light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb sucked it up. Then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up. We were still talking in whispers when the cloud reached the level where it was struck by the rising sunlight so it cleared out the natural clouds. We saw a cloud that was dark and red at the bottom and daylight at the top.""",2023-07-26 21:47:07

If they wanted to dedicate THAT much screen time to him, they can't just have his whole thing be ""Oppenheimer embarrassed me so I plot against him"".

It works as the plot to maybe a comedy children's holiday movie, but not this.",2023-07-27 13:54:01
It was also obvious that they blew up gasoline and propane. Just a big fireball instead of the half-sphere followed by an earth-spewing dirt-colored explosion like you see with a nuke. Nolan's Trinity test looked very 'Hollywood Stunt Show' to me.,2023-07-23 02:11:24

"Well much like Oppenheimer, sounds like you were frustrated by Succession’s later seasons because you were once again watching the show through the incorrect lens. Again, I challenge you to listen to any interview with the show creators. It is, and was never intended to be, anything other than an exploration of its characters. 

I absolutely counter your Maverick example. Maverick is a narrative story with a well fleshed out main character. The fact you can’t tell the difference speaks volumes about your feelings about this movie. From the very beginning, that film tells us it is about the mission first and foremost. The opening scene catches the audience up on what kind of daring pilot maverick is for those unfamiliar. Then we are immediately introduced to the mission, it’s objectives, and why Maverick is chosen for the mission. From the very beginning, the movie is about a linear goal to a specific military mission that Maverick is the main player in. The movie doesn’t care about his background beyond the emotional backstory to keep us invested. It doesn’t care how Mavericks ticks, so to speak, beyond how it serves the primary mission at the heart of the film. From the very beginning Oppenheimer makes it clear it is more concerned about the man than the mission. Places us inside his mind, his visions, his anxiety. The movie makes it clear immediately that HE is our focus, not the historical events that follow. 

It’s all about narrative structure. There is another movie about Oppenheimer that is like Maverick, where from the beginning the bomb is the primary focus and he just happens to be the perfect man for the job and everything else works to show us that and only cares about his psyche and background as far as it serves getting us to the A-bomb, but that’s just simply not how this story is told. Again, I posit to you that rather than assuming this film was supposed to be a narrative driven film that failed and not a successful character study that you misunderstood is solely because of your own expectations.",2023-07-28 10:52:12
"Nah it is kinda confusing because there are 3-4 timelines happening at the same time, one with the pov of Oppenheimer, another with Strauss and sometimes both switching back and forth, sometimes you will see a scene with Strauss in black and white and then the same scene will happen in colour one hour later but this time it will be from pov of Oppenheimer or vice-versa. Sometimes both povs take a back seat and some other character leads the scene like Matt Damon or Emily Blunt. Honestly I don't think an average viewer will get the whole thing with nuances in a single watch because of the complicated narrative and dialogues which require a lot of attention and patience from the viewer.",2023-07-21 16:00:50

The movie simply showed how the team was hastily assembled, then showed a couple scenes of them talking about the theories of the bomb, piecing it together, and it was just smooth sailing throughout with no hiccups and obstacles.

Historically the operation involved over 500,000 people, Washington went into extraordinary lengths to keep the entire operation secret and it still took them 2 years to build the bomb, but the movie only dedicates about 30 min of screen time to Manhattan Project, out of 3 hours run time, and Nolan never  showed the true scale of the operation, of having a city of 500,000 people appeared into existence, the logistics it required, etc. None of it. The whole thing was just glossed over, the prototype bomb was suddenly, magically ready for trial detonation that that was it.

The entirety of the third act is literally just RDJ talking to his aids in a room because the film now needs to deliver expositions upon expositions about what went on and what is going on with Oppenheimer and his questionable communist ties, but fast cut into a incohesive montage of one minute scenes and more confusing time jumps, so much so that the audience isn't even given time and room to process what's happening and feel the emotional impact.

I dare you to tell me you fully understood and was at least 75% following what was actually going on and being said in the entire movie upon first viewing.",2023-07-25 16:23:30

I was actually relieved they didn’t show the result of the bombs being dropped I don’t know why people would want to see that. They showed how it affected Oppenheimer in him having multiple panic attacks with the sound of the bombs etc (in his speech for example). I thought it was pretty obvious why he was upset about the loss of his security clearance. It ruined his reputation and he could no longer speak up about his beliefs. I feel like if you wanted more from it you shouldn’t have watched a Nolan film haha.,2023-07-24 09:53:38

"Well I mean, if Christopher Nolan intended for it to be a biopic of Oppenheimer's life, why wouldn't he put it in the trailer? And I'll tell you why, the people making the trailer wanted to make the target audience as wide as possible. They know that most teenagers aren't going to want to sit through 3 hours of a biopic, so they sprinkled in a few moments in the trailer that hint at it being about his whole life, but excite the movie as the making of the atomic bomb. I must have missed that line, but I think that the general idea of the trailer and most definitely what they were trying to show in the trailer was the making of the bomb. I was actually pleasantly surprised when it turned into his life story, so I don't even care that much.",2023-07-22 15:27:55
"“appreciate history…” they didn’t fully show history by neglecting to portray the devastation oppenheimer’s research had for the world. 

i don’t get you mutual exclusive campers who are so hellbent on praising nolan cuz marketing has led you to believe this is a masterpiece—literally all of his actions / thoughts / political undertakings would be amplified significantly if the audience saw the footage in a nolan fashion—I mean wasn’t this the basis of all the marketing in the first place? every trailer showing explosions, every poster having a bomb in the background… and the culmination of all that is a test explosion and a phone call 😂😂 be so fr w urself bro. movie would’ve been 1000x better w the explosion shown.",2023-07-22 04:17:11
"This is an excuse for the film. History is *insanely* interesting…*as long as you focus on the interesting parts.* Nolan overall failed to do that here.

If I’m telling a story about like, the Punic wars, I don’t spend a third of my time describing how the Roman generals kept avoiding Hannibal at different battles. Because it’s not as interesting as the other parts. It doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate history, it means I know that history isn’t interesting just because it is history.

The communist stuff was good. The Los Alamos part somehow felt rushed and also too shallow. They had the greatest scientific minds of the last century on the screen, but it didn’t feel that way. I feel there was way too much meat left on the bone.

The choice to use the “trial” as a narrative tool didn’t work for me. The trial overall seemed really…unimportant? They talked about how important it was but then he lost and…everything still seemed fine.

The last exchange with Einstein was good.

I just expected more I guess.",2023-07-22 15:25:08

Wouldn't it hang a bit too much then balls? And two metal ones will always be going *ting ting* whenever you walk,2023-07-21 16:17:34
"Exactly.


I feel like Nolan was too concerned with the ""bigger"" stuff and making it look good (and it does), so much so that in his eyes, the ""lesser"" stuff like ""people talking"" scenes felt so boring to him compared to everything else that they barely got any attention, to the point where it almost feels like they were done by a 2nd unit director or something.

"Techniques like non-linearity and the absurd sex scenes are very arthouse. So, while a hundred million Hollywood offering will not be an “arthouse movie” holistically, the director can nevertheless integrate arthouse, or avant-garde, techniques typical of an arthouse film.

And which is effective at times. But not here. Here, it was awkward, pretentious, clumsy, and inarticulate.",2023-07-27 17:45:56

I can't emphasize enough that for a biopic, you really want to restrain the creative ideas.  Otherwise you run the risk of trashing the subject of the movie and etc.

Not sure how many biopics you've seen...most of them aren't that interesting unless you're already interested in the subject matter.  This one reminded me a lot of Imitation Game.  Dr. Strange was great in that but again that movie felt pretty restrained.",2023-07-22 01:51:29

It doesn't *only* potray him in a positive light, but it takes away a lot of the weight of *so much* - his affairs are just ""things that happened"" with very little insight. Hell, his entire ""coming to terms with what the bomb did"" is basically cut down to a 30 second sequence of him looking ""slightly troubled"" while someone shows a slideshow of things from the bomb drops that the audience never sees, and a couple of fever dream sequences...

... In a movie who's runtime licks three hours.

The entire point of the movie is to handwave anything bad that happened because of his work and to focus on how he ""really tried to get that whole cold war situation under control"" without placing any personal responsibility on him or touch on any of the surrounding subjects.",2023-07-24 01:32:41

"If China made a movie about Tiana men Square that didn’t include Tiananmen Square, I’d see the connection. But the movie was about Oppenheimer, not Nagasaki or Hiroshima.

"This is a terrible take.

The film did include, within it's scope, the effects of the bombings through the lens of Oppenheimer. When he was sitting in an auditorium watching the aftermath on a projector and we watched his reaction. He couldn't look. Showing the viewers what he saw would have also taken away from the climax of the film, which for me was the speech he gave with the crowd of people melting. We saw the effects of the bombing through Oppenheimer's disassociative psychosis (arm-chair diagnosis) and how it affected him and caused his heel turn against nuclear proliferation. It is absolutely a valid, artistic and respectful way to show how the tragedy of nuclear weapons. Re-creating those scenes with actors would have been insensitive and using real footage/CGI would not have been consistent with the fabic of this film.",2023-07-24 02:53:56
"Honestly, I think *Nolan* thought it was his job to lecture us, and he chose to glaze right by everything else to really make sure his bit about ""troubled genius"" got put on display.

"I said it was ""a way of making the audience think it"", not that I personally thought it. The fact that it's an absurd thing to think is precisely why that bit of storytelling didn't really work in my mind, because by vilifying the people who were pushing the anti-Oppenheimer view the strongest, it just serves to cheapen the position.

There was plenty of material for Oppenheimer directly to appear to be a conflicted and morally nebulous type of person, and that certainly achieved the effect that you mention here (overall I consider this a 9/10 film), but the fact that his only antagonists in the movie were such despicable people does kinda cheapen the overall quality of the storytelling in my eyes. It was too simplistic.",2023-08-03 22:44:57
"The concept is fine but personally I think it needed much better editing, more showing less telling and not hiding key character motivations to reveal them later like some interesting plot twist.

I have no issue with dialogue heavy movies I love things like Glengarry Glen Ross or Twelve angry men which is the epitome of people talking in a room… but in both there was a clear plot without convoluted jump cuts. The most boring part to me was RDJ talking in a back room with Alden Ehrenreich. It was so clunky. Alden asking all these pointed on the noise questions so RDJ can spit out some exposition. I actually loved RDJs performance but the whole segment dragged

How many more times to hear they suspect he’s a communist? Way too many people bought to that hearing adding very little with their testimony. The whole chevalier thing I didn’t even know what that was by the end. Right now all I got was that Oppenheimers security clearance was denied and that’s bad because he was opposed to building out nukes. What he said to pash or not or who said what about this or that was not clear at all. Lots of talk and hearsay and none of it was clear to me at all.",2023-08-04 11:27:14

"To me, it's the equivalent of saying Memento needs to be seen in IMAX. It was mostly humans talking, why the need for the biggest clearest picture? The only part that felt worthy of IMAX was them testing the bomb for 15 mins and I thought that was just okay, not incredible. 

I have to drive an hour each way for the IMAX theater and it was very much not worth it when a normal theater is less than 5 mins from me. I don't watch any Marvel movies... Mission Impossible on IMAX was 100% worth it and looked awesome almost the entire movie. Oppenheimer looked pretty good for maybe 20 minutes out of 180. 

This is coming from a huge Nolan fan - I saw Tenet on IMAX twice and I didn't even like the movie much, I'd rate it like a 6/10, but at least the movie was very much enhanced on IMAX and I wanted to experience it that way while I could. All his movies since Batman Begins have been must see on IMAX, but not Oppenheimer.

"Someone isn't creepy because they put nudity in a movie.  

The reason why I said hollywood needs more nudity isn't masturbatory....I don't really like gratuituous nudity.  It's more like it makes a drama ring somewhat more true.  In a lot of movies, if two people just had sex, the next scene will often be the two characters in bed with the woman having the sheets pulled over her chest, which seems a bit modest for two people who just had sex and takes you out of a movie.

Real life involves sex and nudity.  It makes things seem more real and less ""coddled"" if you include the swears and nudity.  If you see a couple of breasts it's a little bit of a shock but really pulls you more into the movie.  A good example is when Oppenheimer is nude during the hearing.  It makes you, the watcher, really feel as vulnerable as he does in tha tmoment.

Florence has always been comfortable with nudity, and they have procedures to make actresses in nude scenes as comfortable as possible.  It was only breasts.  You can't even see her crotch.  You seem fairly puritan if you think that's ""creepy"".  Do you also think Titanic was creepy? Relationships involve nudity.

"As I said, I’ve already seen the explosion. And of course the way that the real explosion is shot isn’t as interesting but it is still far greater than the one in the film. The movie one may as well have been a stock explosion from any Marvel film with a couple of close-ups; my point is, it was nothing special, like how it was marketed to be. There was zero sense of scale, something which is very evident in the real footage.

As for the second comment, you are completely missing the point. The films attempt to be complicated and intelligent comes in the form of characters speaking fast and quipping at each other. As for nuance, I think this was one of the least subtle films I’ve ever seen. How can you get any less nuanced than the gymnasium scene or Oppenheimer reading out the “I am become death” quote in Sanskrit whilst having sex, or the scene of Kitty imagining Oppenheimer and Tatlock having sex in the boardroom.

"Because Nolan did not make a character I cared about enough for me to be invested in that part of the movie. The extent of Oppenheimer’s cheating should have made me not like him, but with the way it was portrayed, I honestly didn’t care. 

Oppenheimer should be able to stand on its own as a movie without requiring a bunch of context. I feel like I was only able to piece together a lot of the movie because I knew a decent amount about him.

The Imitation Game, a film about Alan Turing, did a much better job about getting people to care about the character and sympathize with him when he gets ostracized for being gay, and on top of that deliver a film that builds excitement to breaking the enigma code. And in that movie there’s a scene where they discuss when they can appropriately use the intel to save lives, balancing it with the cost of the Germans discovering the British know the code.

">highlight the absurdity of the witch hunt against him

Yeah exactly. As director Nolan80 could have focused more on different aspects of Oppenheimer's life but the whole movie hinged on that event.

Highlighting a specific event or period is not something that just happens, that's a deliberate choice on the part of the director.

Putting particular emphasis on his choice to stay out of the Communist party but also focusing so much on him getting eviscerated for his involvement with communists anyways is the voice of the movie",2023-07-23 18:05:34

Now that I know a bit more of its history I def understand how crucial it is.

As for the nudity, that second part where they both sat down and talked, that was necessary, that really showed how flawed he was, but i respectfully disagree with that frontal nudity where he read that line, that was a bit corny",2023-07-24 00:07:20

The flames they choose to use were so obviously not atomic bomb, it was completely painful for me... After all that preparation for it and they do this... using CGI is sometimes really good... this scene needs it, but Nolan choose to blow off few canisters of gas, do few cuts and slow it down instead... total letdown for any atomic energy enthusiast",2023-07-25 08:24:57

"Now let me rant why I like David Lynch's version so much.

It starts out showing the massive scale of the detonation site, and the stillness of the desert morning. No human hands on a big red button, this is beyond human in scope and scale.

When the bomb goes off, the strings in Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima explode in its iconic jarring cacophony of noise. We don't need to hear the bang, the music portrays the power and prophecy of the bomb better than any sound effect could.

Every shadow the fireball casts makes the whole shot look absolutely massive, as we approach and dive _into_ the explosion. We got to see it far away, now we get to see it up close.

Where the ensuing video disintegration really makes it feel like reality, and our human understanding, breaks down at these energies.

Then the scene shifts into color as we travel down what's presumably the shaft of the mushroom cloud, etching closer and closer to the source of evil. Shockwaves ripple towards the camera and riiight before we've arrived large bubbles of tremendous energy form like the film reel caught fire and burned up.

The victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki didn't think a bomb hit them, they thought the world was ending. And this is how you show the weight of the weapons that makes a human assume such a thing, not what Nolan did, in my opinion.",2023-07-28 01:41:38

Meanwhile we covered like a decade in the first 2 hours, and it had a much more narrative structure.

Ultimately for me it made it feel like the first 2/3 were just buildup for an hour of falling action. It was obvious from early on that they would never approve his clearance even if this wasn’t historical lol.

The runtime also seemed fine to me, considering it's actually two hearings happening in parallel. I do think the convergence of the timelines in the final ~40 or so minutes could have been handled better - The Strauss/""Fusion"" perspective needed more time, and the Oppenheimer/""Fission"" one could've been streamlined.

As to the bomb being underwhelming, I don't think we can do anything other than agree to disagree. I understand that people's sense of ""real"" power/scale is irredeemably screwed by pop fiction, but I strongly believe that not all works have to toe the line forever to compensate

"I didn't have any bias against the film until I saw it and was underwhelmed. I've enjoyed most of Nolan's films and have always considered him one of my favorite directors.

Why would using the word ""dreck"" make me feel clever? It's a word. And I claimed no superiority, intellectual or otherwise, over people who enjoyed it. Sounds like you're projecting some insecurities. The fact that people who didn't like Oppenheimer have been told in multiple threads to go watch Transformers or the MCU is what I'm referring to. 

There are many other comments taking issue with the film that have been downvoted to hell despite providing much more substantial criticism than the one that led off this thread. You're right that I probably did pick the wrong comment thread to post my little rant in, but my point is bigger than defending one person's criticism of Oppenheimer.",2023-08-02 18:10:19

"Not really about that. Most Nolan scene pieces have some purpose.. this was plain gratuitous. There have beautiful love stories in Nolan movies that did not need this. So this definitely didnt. Nolan has technique to show it more aesthetically. It was just too in your face. Like look.. BOOBS, sex lol. Idk. Felt very un Nolan to me.  Also whatever depth the intimacy of the scene could have garnered was spoiled by the whole ominous quote in the moment.. a quote which would be so significant later on.",2023-07-21 22:11:59

"Really... You think he could have made Oppenheimer read passages of the Quran, Torah and Bible while someone is riding him with no repercussions? Really? Are we serious? Lol. 

Ofcourse the Destroyer of the Worlds quote from the Gita is important to the story. 

Nobody has a problem with it when it was used right after Trinity. 

It was the way it was used in the first instance that's outright disrespectful. 

Again, I have no issues with it. I had more issues with the sex scenes being gratuitous at best. Not the quote being used. 

BUT it doesn't mean I don't understand where people are coming from when they point out that Nolan couldn't have done the same with other religious texts. To have a woman demand Oppenheimer to read it out while she was riding him. That's what made it problematic to them. Not the use of the quote, not the use of the Gita in the story. 

It's not about who cares and who doesn't. I am certainly not the one throwing a tantrum lol. Clearly as I see it, the Indian film board kept it in which is great. BUT it wouldn't have been able to keep it in if the quote belonged to the Bible or Quran. That's the point. And it's a valid point. There is a clear demarcation of what is acceptable and what is not. If anything, this helps the Hindu community's tolerant  stance even more. At the same time, the lines are clearly drawn on the sand. 

And am no white knight lmao.  Literally or figuratively. The assumption is indeed hilarious.",2023-07-22 19:28:39

"I just left the film too. Like I said, way too many characters who are unexplained, totally convoluted scientists and politicians with no explanation of their story. Zero mention of Axis vs Allies which is absurd for a film that takes place during WW2. Called “Russia” throughout movie, not as Soviet Union.

I would like to mention that I don’t know anything about history and I’ve never taken an in depth WW2 history lesson (I was in high school during covid, they cut a lot of stuff out of the curriculum).

"I think I kinda overplayed the “fell asleep” part because I’m pretty sure it was only for like 10 ish minutes. It was also kinda right around the part where the bomb went off so I don’t think I missed too much of the Strauss parts of the movie (the Strauss parts are what confused me). Also, I think even aside from falling asleep, the movie isn’t super easy to understand for someone with minimal knowledge on the topic. I know I should have just done pre movie research but tbh I don’t care enough about ww2 to research it",2023-07-26 00:01:41

"Yeah and there is also a scene where his wife throws a glass against the wall accusing Strauss of being behind it, and when Albert asks him why he is going through with the hearing he says ""I have my reasons.""  


Like most of the movie I think they make it ambiguous. There is a strong argument to be made that Oppie had strong suspicions the entire time, to your point you can make an argument he did not. It isn't clear to history his reasons for going through with the hearing, and Nolan did a good job of staying within the grey there i thought.",2023-08-23 22:24:04

Like for example, you could have a friend that you love more than your significant other, but your significant other is the only person you have sex with. So to them the latter hurts more if you cheat with sex.

However emotional cheating, from the cheaters perspective, probably feels more wrong, or at least it should in theory I’d feel.",2023-07-23 12:34:19

"My general read on that scene (whatever Nolan says philosophically, I’m going with “B&W” roughly corresponds to Strauss’ viewpoint and “Color” is Oppenheimer’s) is that it’s the kind of comment that Oppenheimer (and frankly, I myself) might make to kill two birds with one stone. It makes his relationship with wealth/privilege clear (I grew up with some degree of wealth and privilege) while also making it clear he’s not from generational money and *does* understand what life is like for “normal people.”

His “lowly shoe salesman” comment is a similar thing…from a certain point-of-view it’s dismissive, but the more likely read given who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, is that it’s ironically lampshading the past (I doubt that he gave enough though to shoe salesman to think of them as particularly lowly), and that it’s acknowledging an achievement and simply acknowledging what would otherwise be an elephant in the room.

I think it goes overall with J. Robert Oppenheimer hiding his arch, ironic playfulness (this was the guy who’d amuse his colleagues by jumping up and touching the ceiling) behind a serious “straight man” facade, and often putting his foot in his mouth because he didn’t understand that not everyone was in on the joke.

And Strauss is literally and symbolically abstract “power” for the purposes of this story. He knows enough science to know that he *doesn’t* have the capacity to create wondrous things like Oppenheimer or Einstein do, even though he gets to ultimately direct and wield them, and that constantly eats at him.

I know it isn’t established historical fact that Strauss was the one who took down Oppenheimer, but it’s the bet guess, so it goes well with this portrait of him.",2023-08-17 19:40:08

"I think it’s up to speculation for now. To me, his first “hallucination” was of a Los Alamos supportive resident whose face melted. He didn’t hallucinate a Japanese person’s face melting.

Churchill, however, was outraged and denounced ""the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country."" He said that only war criminals should be put on trial in accordance with the Moscow Document, which he had written.

He explains at length just how terribly we’d already fire-bombed the hell out of Japan. He admits if we’d lost the war he’d have been prosecuted as a war criminal. 

They even mention in Oppenheimer briefly how the fire bombing of Tokyo killed 100k civilians. 

I’m not justifying it but at the same time we were already kinda doing worse damage.",2023-07-22 15:36:35
"When did I say they were justified? The original commenter said that nuclear bombs were inevitable. Are you that naive to think that even if the US decided not to drop 2 bombs that someone in sometime in history would not have eventually dropped it? The movie even included the philosophy of ‘does the end justify the means?’ When you try to think of the moral dilemma here, there are magnitudes of devastation of whichever way you want to frame or reframe the problem - the chain reaction Oppenheimer started was more than just civilian lives. The US bombing of those cities were less devastating than hundreds of conflicts before and after that event however, nothing consumed more lives in less time than that weapon. Try to understand beyond the political circus in the movie, and think why would the US turn so quickly on Oppenheimer since the bomb pretty much started the Cold War that is implied heavily. This movie is way beyond your own comprehension of what’s morally right and what’s morally wrong. Humans are rational actors who continually do irrational things to the detriment of his/her own kind.",2023-07-22 15:40:12

"First off realize the movie is a dramatic interpretation, no matter if it does a pretty good job with some historical moments.

Secondly, the race to build atomic weapons was ""on"" no matter if the US wanted it or not. It comes down to game theory. Each player is going to optimize their position and assume the other player is going to optimize theirs. It isn't that they were trying not to think of the future, it's that they wanted to have control of the future and assume they are the most rationale player.

Not to mention that it isn't one person making a decision, large human organizations are beauracratic entities of their own. You may could argue the president had some control, but the film points out how little any one individual has control of situations on this scale of humanity, even Oppenheimer himself.",2023-07-23 04:34:02

Which means Einstein is saying he think the world might have already ended just not our one. As implying a future fate set in motion I think would have got a different wording not in past tense. 

Which means Einstein is saying the world already ended just not our one. Which means Einstein is saying the world already ended just not our one.

2. Dropping a Nuke wasn't even nearly close to where the generals were, which we knew at the time they weren't even there, it was far away from where they were and it was literally drop on civilians only

Japan was also on low supply as well, the morale was low, but yet saying that it was necessary to drop the bomb is psychotic, because it wasn't when you add all those factors in

It wad definitely a part of it, but it wasn't just because of ""that one time"".

3rd: Have you seen Dr. Strangelove? Deals with essentially the same subject and went over just fine.

"I guess I said that due to the historical context i read about. Nolan definitely made it seem like more of a personal vandetta against Oppie due to humiliating him regarding exporting radioisotopes and thinking he made Einstein hate him.  It was slightly implied since Strauss was Chairman of the AEC and the lawyer he appointed as prosecutor was hammering him about opposition to the H bomb, although in the context of the movie Strauss was just using that as a say to get back at him rather than actually caring if he was a Soviet sympathist. 

Regardless, the atomic bomb was a huge plot point for the first 2 hours of the movie. The aftermath and Oppenheimer's feelings about his creation is also just as interesting (in my opinion). He regretted giving humanity the fire that he thinks will allow themselves to destroy themselves.",2023-07-24 22:36:11

"Although the movie was bloated beyond measure, it still managed to get all the details of his earlier, mid and life during the hearings encapsulated in 3hrs. It got confusing at times, due to the character decisions that they made due to reasons known best to them, like Kitty not leaving her husband after facing humiliation in front of hearing committee, Oppenheimer still wanting to make bomb; knowing Nazis had stopped and that the bomb could start a nuclear weapons race among the countries and why Strauss would feel that Oppenheimer thought of him as inferior as to making Einstein not make contact with him and insulting him about his concerns of freely transporting radioactive isotopes. As the movie follows real life story of flawed and conflicted characters, at the same time, it only seemed only way possible to present the facts in the way they happened, without trying to provide much logic into the decisions characters made, ‘cause that would’ve made the film pretentious beyond measure.
It also made clear with Oppenheimer being the character study main subject of the film, why his nemesis, who tarnished his reputation and made him face the guilt that he already had, over and over again with shifts in Oppenheimer and Staruss’s perspectives being intertwined.  It surely was exhausting near the end, but still, it was quite satisfactory to know and think that all of these events happened and it closed both their perspectives on a good note, with that hint through that last scene that Oppeneheimer could never really escape the guilt knowing what could happen. 7.5/10",2023-07-25 18:39:36

There were some inaccuracies, yes but the delivery was perfect in showcasing multiple POV's and how misinformation actually works.

I'm getting the feeling that you're one of those people who asks for ""proof"" and  ""doesn't read an essay"" when someone ultimately provides it to you.

Or the movie would have to introduce the point of view of a 3rd character. Which would be equally jarring.

Oppenheimer states to Kitty that none of the details of his affair were new he misinterpreted her anger/hurt as she states the issue is now it’s all out there for everyone to know. She hates what they’re doing to his name, his legacy. Throughout the interrogation we see her take issue with Oppie not “fighting” back. 

Anyway the film could’ve done without the Florence scenes which could have shaved some time. But that’s just my perspective. Thanks for the chat.",2023-08-28 13:27:29

">J. Robert Oppenheimer didn’t view the Bhagwat Geeta as just “poetry”. The real man knew it was a sacred document.

And you're completely ignoring 99% of what I said.

Oppenheimer wasn't born into a Buddhist tradition. Therefore, his knowledge of and respect for Buddhism had to be acquired from somewhere. When Jean is looking at his bookcase, he tells her that he is still learning Sanskrit; therefore, we can infer that his knowledge and appreciation of Buddhism is still in development. The film also makes it pretty clear that this scene happens when he is still very early in his career, and while I don't know when he came to develop his understanding of Buddhism, we can further infer that this scene takes place when his knowledge is still in development. You're expecting the film to portray his relationship with Buddhism as fully-developed throughout the entirety of his life.

It's also worth noting that Oppenheimer is seen with a copy of TS Eliot's *The Waste Land*, which contains the poem *The Hollow Men*. Given the content of *The Hollow Men*, this is fairly on-the-nose and also very ironic, but more importantly, the western poetic tradition presents epic poetry in a very particular way. Epic poetry recounts the founding of civilisations; that's what the *Iliad* is -- the independent city-states of ancient Greece band together for the Trojan War, and in the aftermath of the siege, the coalition holds together. That's why the period is referred to as the Hellenic Period -- because of Helen of Troy. Likewise, the *Odyssey* recounts Odysseus' journey home and emphasises his relationship to the gods. It's a way of passing on the cultural values of the time. Western education would have seen the *Bhagavad Gita* as being of a similar ilk. Especially given that Oppenheimer was educated during the Modernist period.

The real Oppenheimer may not have seen it as poetry, but the film is absolutely trying to position him as someone who approaches this as an intellectual pursuit first and foremost, but misses the context. That's his flaw. ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" isn't just referring to the atomic bomb -- it also refers to the personal and private worlds that he destroys.",2023-07-21 23:20:31

"I’m no filmmaker, but until my opinions on the film solidify (and I watch it again), I’m going to softly stand on the side of ‘Nolan chose the story that he thought would be best represented thru the chosen medium’. The movie affected me deeply, and from my perspective, he produced a film which succeeded at being a romantic and political drama, a documentary, an action film. I felt every emotion Nolan was trying to elicit from me, and maybe that makes me a fanboy.

Besides, a whole act of the movie is split with a character that isn't Oppenheimer. A lot of the emotional impact of the third act is also supposed to come from the scientists that Oppenheimer worked with, but we have literally no idea from the movie what their relationship was like. It makes it empty. I think an important part of Oppenheimer is the people he worked and lived close to for 4 years of his life.

"Easy.

1. Oppenheimer, a European taught physics student who prefers theory over practical experimentation, returns to the US and takes up a job teaching at UC Berkeley.
2. Oppenheimer develops relationships with Communists, both card-caring and sympathetic, including his brother and first and second wives.
3. WW2 to breaks out and Oppenheimer is selected to lead the Manhattan Project, believing atomic weapons necessary in order to beat the Nazis.
4. Oppenheimer and Groves assemble a team of scientists including Edward Teller to work on the bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
5. After years of work, the atomic bomb is successfully tested and eventually used against the Japanese.
6. Oppenheimer embraces his newfound celebrity as the ""father of the bomb"" but suffers from guilt regarding its use, especially as he had ignored the objections of some of his fellow scientists.
7. Following the war, Oppenheimer becomes an advisor to the US Atomic Energy Commission where butts heads with Lewis Strauss over the exportation of radioactive isotopes, the development of Teller's hydrogen bomb, and the nuclear arms race policy.
8. Strauss orchestrates Oppenheimer to lose his security clearance in a show trial, digging up Oppenheimer's previous brushes with Communism and turning Oppenheimer into a political pariah.
9. Years later, the senate rejects Strauss's nomination as secretary of commerce in a hearing after criticism from the scientific community about Strauss's handling of Oppenheimer's security clearance.

The movie criminally never showed the urgency that the US team faced in the theoretical bomb race against Nazi Germany, which was a huge factor in the whole operation.

The movie also never showed us the true scale of the entire operation, how secretive it really was and the lengths the US government went through to hide the entire city from the entire world.

"> It ruined his reputation and he could no longer speak up about his beliefs.

I feel like maybe because the dialogue was drown out by the music and sound, but it's hard to understand what exactly his beliefs are when you can barely hear it. IMO that round table discussion, aside from Strauss being humiliated at that one hearing, a pretty important point in the film that's supposed to paint the conflict between Oppie and Strauss, but that single scene got cut into bits and pieces and shown probably a minimum of 10 times throughout the film, making it pretty incoherent to follow between all the other things going on.

How much insight do you want I to an affair? It doesn’t take a long dialogue to understand cheating is wrong. Everyone knew when the cheating happened, it was wrong, and a flaw of Oppenheimer. 

What personal responsibility did you want them to give to Oppenheimer? The film already mentions how much the bombing weighs on him, with him telling the president he has blood on his hands, to the room shaking with the cheering (best I can describe it).

Oppenheimer wants to tell the US government about the chemist, but he doesn’t want to implicate his friend Chevalier, so he tries to lie and keep his name out of it, which makes him look very suspicious. He eventually does reveal it was Chevalier, but months after the fact after the government spent a ton of time and money trying to figure out who it was.

"I have been questioning over the last few years, why I used to like his films as a teenager. Every since he got rid of his Editor, Lee Smith, and Hans Zimmer, his movies have been too quickly edited, less interesting stories, and filled with music that is ill-suited for the scenes. Also his disdain for women in his work is something that makes his filmography increasingly problematic to me.

I just feel like her being nude was unnecessary because it was clearly done to arouse the viewer and if it wasn't, then why have her breasts in frame with erect nipples and in focus during the seated conversation scene or during the trial fantasy?

Nudity can be fine for me in the right context and more skillful directors have used it to great effect. Titanic is not a film I like at all because of its exploitation of a tragedy and my aversion to James Cameron.

This nudity was distracting for someone like me that has trouble focusing and is irritated by the lack of visual storytelling of the film thus far. It felt like he added it in specifically because he needed butts in seats. Both Cillian and Emily Blunt have been ok with nudity in the past, but why not here too? Perhaps Nolan only wanted to have the youngest woman in the main cast nude because he only wanted her to be a sad sex object for his protagonist and anything more would be a turn-off? It definitely wasn't an excuse to use her rising star power and sex appeal to get his main demo of straight men.

Why was Oppie seated weirdly cross-legged in a prudish manner hiding his genitals from the camera, it would be more realistic to have them sitting without regard to that. 

The movie is too quick and it failed to make me care about hidden meanings when I can't follow the basic plot on screen.

Sorry, but I need time to process my feelings on this and this might not be the most eloquent response.",2023-07-22 14:25:06

"I’d argue they do show the devastation but once again through his eyes. You see him when giving the speech, he imagines the bright flash and the woman’s skin falling off etc.

I don’t think this film is essentially just a focus on what happened in Japan. It’s about Oppenheimer taking responsibility for opening the forbidden door into nuclear weapons that still threaten our existence to this day (as displayed in the ending).",2023-07-21 20:12:26

"I have to partly agree partly disagree.  I liked the whole Strauss-Oppenheimer angle. He's the man who discredited the father of the atomic bomb, the reason for his exile from further influencing so he's definitely needed. Why he did that, his motivations, why others helped it's compelling. What wasn't was the back and forth of the narrative. We wasted too much time on him. If this was a HBO Max series with hours upon hours to spend, this would have been perfect. We couldn't really focus on Los Alamos because of how much importance he's given. The trial/Senate hearing became the focal point. Not the making of the bomb and the consequences that followed.",2023-07-22 04:42:08

People who expected otherwise really don't have a justification for that, promo material is always designed to suck you in to watch the movie regardless what it is, that's why it featured many of the scenes with effects and intense score, reading the short description of the plot is enough to know what it is about.",2023-07-21 12:37:25

"Ah, that's a pity, they are sort of talking about a man (and some people believe that Ariadne is actually Cobb's wife and is trying to get him to escape the dream world). Nolan's female characters don't talk to each other about anything interesting because they have no depth, but in his ""defense,"" neither do most of his male characters. In Tenet, we cared about, what, the sidekick guy a little bit because of the ending? Everyone else, including the main character, could have died and I would not have minded at all.",2023-08-01 00:45:16

The movie does a very bad job at making us understand, and therefore care, for the third act. Which is why so many people have a problem with it. All in the name of Nolan's forced obtuseness and complexity.",2023-07-23 12:17:05

"Allow me to argue that the Manhattan project saves more lives compared to the alternatives. Without the bombs, amphibious assault was necessary, which would result in more deaths.

The sound design for the movie was incredible before the bomb, it just felt like the actual impact (or lack there of) of the bomb was underwhelming.  Watch any other nuclear bomb vid, real or recreation and you can get this sense of scale to them. You could tell with this movie  that Nolan was very much trying to dance around with an imitation of a nuclear bomb with very good editing and directing decisions. Which to his credit seems to have mostly worked for a lotta people, just not for me. 

&#x200B;

Top Gun Maverick's a pretty great recent example of a movie that touted its use of practical effects, actually using jets for shooting and easily brought its marketing to the final product. I had little to no interest in the movie before it hit but I ended up watching it around 5 times in cinemas last year, bought tickets for like 5 other people just to see it because you could actually *feel* the jet engines roaring 5 minutes into the movie, and  much more later on.

With Oppenheimer I feel like touting the use of practical effects just really didn't translate as well as it could have.",2023-07-25 11:33:53
A movie having no CGI isn’t any more or less inherently impressive than a movie having a lot of CGI. It’s 2023 and you’re making a 100+ million dollar movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer. Maybe a bit of CGI to show an atomic blast wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.,2023-07-25 11:07:58

"> How much do you think you actually learn about Oppenheimer just from watching the movie? Did you find out how Oppenheimer was raised? What were his parents like? What got him into physics in the first place? What drove him? What were his goals?

Oppenheimer reminded me of The Imitation Game, and your questions here reminded me of a nice detail: Alan Turing tells us that when he was a kid, the other kids at school bullied him because he had to separate the peas and the carrots because they're different colors. What similar detail did we get about Oppenheimer? The only early-life detail that comes to mind is him reading the Bahgavad Gitta while having sex. Later on, we see glimpses of interesting personal affairs - Jean kills herself and Oppenheimer brings his kid to a friend's house because Kitty is an alcoholic - but Nolan never explored these details, and I didn't know why they were there or why we should care about them.",2023-07-31 09:23:20

Matt Damon's character even said none of the scientists as Los Alamos would have been approved for the new security clearance measures because o their communist leanings.

It seems like you just chose to dislike Oppenheimer (the person) so you want to disagree with any pieces of reality that do not align with that.

The reason the movie shows his guilt over the bomb is because it’s a movie about his life and his guilt was a big driving factor as to why some people grew impatient with him and eventually (along with Strauss’ vendetta) cost him his security clearance.

Having an antihero as a lead I don’t see an inherent issue with - many of my favorite films have antiheroes as leads that you could bring the same argument for - Taxi driver, fight club etc 

I think Nolan consistently has morally dubious antiheroes in his movies, people who believe they are right and their flaws are hinted at throughout - but then ultimately are revealed by the end to be deeply problematic. The film didn’t seem sympathetic to him at all - he didn’t seem redeemed by the end he just seemed to recognize that he had done a horrible thing.

"I honestly had no knowledge of Robert Oppenheimer before going into it. I’m not super interested in time pieces either, but that’s slowly changing. I thought it would be good but I didn’t expect it to like it as much as I did

I really enjoyed all the emotion. I’d have to write an essay if I detailed how well the cinema was from the use of lighting, sound, delivery of lines, props, camera shots, etc. Everything was intentional. I felt Oppenheimer’s humanity as he began to question his own invention. His love for science and inventiveness was his own downfall (in his mind). For example, the scene with the rowdy Americans and the lights flashing and getting bright and Oppenheimer relating it the bomb detonating in Japan. Hearing terror and screaming in the cheers of applause for his own work. His realization in the end that he had a hand in mass destruction. Even the use of silence to show how grave Oppenheimer’s invention would be. And then the scene with the bombs being loaded into trucks and driven away. All his dedication and work taken just like that. 

I thought it was brilliant. 

The line President Truman said, “They don’t care who created the bomb, only who dropped it” really stuck with me. Because it’s so true. The invention of the bomb was extraordinary, but it’s use was so deadly and wrong. Although Oppenheimer is credited with created it, it was the government that dropped it. Yet he still feels responsible. It’s interesting.",2023-08-03 03:56:43

You are acting like the larger religions don't get shown in ways like these,or in controversial scenarios. Christianity is constantly being shown I poor tastes,in poor light,in poor situations,etc. Seriously stop acting like people other than crack head Southern states in America actually gets mad when Christianity is brought up. And the biggest issue with your argument is that many of these religions that you're stating are in countries with very different beliefs on what's allowed. If a country bans a movie for something like this is because they have heavy religious laws,it's not that the majority of believer's hate it. It's the government doesn't want to show a piece of work to show a Religion in less than flattering situations.

And again there's nothing outright disrespectful here. There's legitimate irl people who will tell their partner to say religious shit during sex. This is some bold or unrealistic thing that's done to be disrespectful. This was to show how close he was with here and how much he showed her/how connected with death he was. You missed the entire point and instantly went with ""He'S jUsT aNoThEr RaCisT"". Which proves what type of person you are,if you don't bend down to religion you're now racist and a piece of shit. Wow great philosophy that people have shown to agree with.

And it does matter who cares. If the followers of the religion and the governments that rule over regions that worship this Religion has more weight that randoms on the internet calling it racist. And the majority of them don't give a shit that's why it wasn't banned. They don't care,stop getting offended on the behalf of other people.

one thing that is severely underlooked by redditors about this subject is the massive power struggle among the 2 and then 3 branches of the military immediately postwar.

So the Airforce both up-played it's involvement in the surrender of japan, and used it to claim that the army and navy were no longer needed with nuclear bombs being a thing. The Army and Navy both were forced to deny this.

Somebody was probably going to finish the atom bomb, and they wanted to be first.  
  
But then there’s the Jurassic Park argument. Yes, technology will continue to advance no matter what we do, but we have the power to say “no.” Just because we *can* create dinosaurs, doesn’t mean we *should.*

"> I think you're not reading the comment you're replying to. 

No, you’re the one who’s not reading the comment you’re replying to.

In anticipation of an invasion of mainland Japan, a lot of Purple Hearts were made. Since the invasion of Japan didn’t happen due to the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, those Purple Hearts never got used for that purpose. And they’re still using those Purple Hearts to this day. 

That means that the anticipated casualties of an invasion of Japan is less than the past 80 years of American warfare. This isn’t a conversation of the validity of that warfare, it’s a testament to how brutal the invasion of Japan was expected to be. And that’s just American soldiers, not the expected losses of Japan’s military and other “civilian” casualties.

> What does it matter if a lot of soldiers would have died, how does that change anything in this argument?

The argument you’re missing is that once Pandora’s Box is opened, it’s not shutting. Once the possibility of a world dominating weapon is believed to exist, then it’s a race to be the first. Wasn’t it Einstein who said “I do not know what World War 3 will be fought with, but World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones”?

There was a major theme of Oppenheimer trying to keep the Soviets involved in order to not create fear, “We have this magnificent weapon that could destroy the world, I want them to to know so our ‘frenemy’ doesn’t know we’re hiding it from them and anticipating us using it against them.”

"I think you missed my point, the Gita isn’t a casual read and I don’t believe or didn’t assert that Oppenheimer was a devout Hindu. Nevertheless he still would have been serious about the philosophy. 

The scene is ridiculous in numerous ways and a good parallel would have been like showing someone reading Schopanhaeur during sex. The scene shows a lack of understanding of why it resonated with him and at worst, is guilty of the same old tired trope of Western movies mystifying Asian philosophy for an exotic effect. 

Oppenheimer didn’t just quote the Gita or Hindu scriptures once. He also quoted famously:

“In battle, in forest, at the precipice in the mountains, On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows, In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame, The good deeds a man has done before defend him”

To a layperson this sounds like a cool quote. To someone versed with where this comes form, it’s clearly a karmic quote related to rebirth and reincarnation.

The movie missed an opportunity, an open goal, to delve into his own spirituality and how he thought about his past karma and future karma.",2023-07-21 17:52:41

Have the consequences been that disastrous? When was the last time multiple major world powers were directly involved in large scale war with each other? It was going to be developed either way and it’s impossible to say what the right call was anyway. Let’s say the bombs don’t exist. Is there a WW3 between the Soviets and the West that kills tens of millions? I think everyone would agree that the Pax Atomica is preferable. What if the bombs were developed but not used against Japan? Since the world hasn’t seen their effects in this hypothetical are they more likely to be used in large numbers in the future? It’s impossible to say. I don’t think we should assume that the grass would be greener without nukes,2023-07-22 12:57:13

Oppenheimer was also utterly passionless in the sex scene, which makes sense for the character at the time but it also feels at odds with his philandering ways as you didn’t really get the feeling he enjoyed sex very much. At least not from the instances we saw.

WW1 was like this as well. Sure it seems sensible to stop the war once everyone realizes its a meat grinder, but by then the meat grinder has its own mind. It can't be stopped except by its own all absorbing will.

and TDK in particular is not entirely oblivious to this point, IMO! there's a reason it draws parallels between batman and the joker. there's a reason that morgan freeman's character criticizes him for the phone surveillance in the third act. but it doesn't commit to these criticisms because batman is alway proved to be justified in his actions in the end.

"The censorship itself is very immoral and the movie itself is also immoral for a number of reasons. 

One is that he reads the Hinduism bible during a sexual intercourse with his mistress to portray himself as “holy”. During the film, he also reads the Hinduism bible, “Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds” to justify creating such a destructive weapon and genocide. Religions and politics are supposed to be separated. He is a scientist, yet still relied on his personal belief that’s not based on a science. In Ancient times, Aryans formed Hinduism in order to conquer India and its people.

The explicit porn-like affair scene itself was immoral and unnecessarily long when it could be portrayed in a different way or much shorter, especially in a movie portrays such a serious sensitive topic that could be devastating to the victims of the bomb and those who passed away. It is to contrast the racial superiority of the survivors being justified even though it is considered a sin (having an affair, a genocide) and the inferiority of the fatalities. The porn was effectively used as a brainwashing effect to defy people's moral compass.

And all of this was exploited in a way however the creators of the movie wanted. The reality is that he might probably never read the Bible during a sexual intercourse, nor read the line in a positive way but to moan, unlike the movie. Oppenheimer passed away in 1967 and he does not exist anymore so “the dead can’t speak”.

Einstein was not allowed to develop a nuclear weapon because he was considered a left wing, favoring Japan as he set a letter to his sons on Dec 17, 1922 “The Japanese do appeal to me… better than all the peoples I’ve met up to now: quiet, modest, intelligent, appreciative of art, and considerate, nothing is for the sake of appearances, but rather everything is for the sake of substance” and his appreciation to Japan did not stop.

Einstein, upon learning of the drop of the atomic bomb, said, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, ""woe is me"".

""If I had known that the Germans would not have succeeded in creating an atomic bomb, I would not have lifted a finger,"" the physicist noted.

Szilard and Wigner were of the same opinion.

Even Robert Oppenheimer, who led the development of the bomb, hoped that it would never be used.

None of this was portrayed in a film but Einstein only appears with not so much of an interest but with an agreement.

The film doesn’t portray the entire background but cherry-picking how they chose Japan to drop the bomb. There was a racial motivation that played a major role on a decision to drop the bomb in Japan. There were many racist ideas from Truman that could never be shown to the public but never should have been omitted. Everything portrayed in a Hollywood movie is justified even when they said “Kyoto was an amazing beautiful historical city we went on a honeymoon so exclude that”. How easy was it for them to decide whether to conduct genocide or not? Every city in Japan is indescribably beautiful for the people who live in in many different ways and so is any city in the world. How can be so stereotypical and judgmental without him genuinely knowing about Japan and it’s people without any filter?

An article by The United States Department of Defense says ”Some observers express the view that Japan was a victim of the Atomic bomb primarily because of the United States racist views toward Japanese and that we would not have done the same thing to Caucasians in the European war. The facts mentioned in the preceding paragraphs decrease the credibility of that argument. That does not relieve President Truman from the charge that he was racist. Evidence shows that he was. Truman used the ""n-word"" frequently, including in letters to his wife, Bess. In one letter, Truman writes, his Uncle Will ""says the Lord made a white man of dust, a nigger from mud, then threw up what was left and it came down a Chinaman. He does hate Chinese and Japs. So do I."" Although this is an example of his racist attitudes and the attitudes of many Americans at the time (and perhaps — unfortunately even now). Harry did do some things that show a different side of him-, such as integrating the military services after the war. “

US still using the scenes today to justify the white colonialism with an extreme emphasis.

http://y2u.be/zBIfnPyK4rw

Where is the truth in this? This is only racism.

Japan opened a country in 1854 and WWII ended in 1945. Before 1854 Japan was completely closed in traditional Japanese clothes in kimono etc with ABSOLUTELY NO ZERO CONTACT with foreign countries except cultural exchange with neighbors.
The national isolation policy “Sakoku” lasted 265 years was to protect Japan from the worldwide White colonialism of almost 500 years.
After 15+ attempts, US finally deceived Japan into opening a country, threatening Britain which obtained British Hong Kong, India, China in Opium War, will colonize Japan, force dressed in Western clothes and militarized Japan. 
In the American military training, not only they provided and taught all the western technologies how to use weapons, vehicles, US brainwashed Japan to hate the other and be as savage as possible.

Japanese had a high cultural sense as Van Gough said “All my work is based to some extent on Japanese art.”

Einstein about Japan

“The Japanese do appeal to me… better than all the peoples I’ve met up to now: quiet, modest, intelligent, appreciative of art, and considerate, nothing is for the sake of appearances.” Dec 17, 1922

“Among us we see many Japanese, living a lonely existence, studying diligently, smiling in a friendly manner” - During his visit to Japan

In an essay published in 1923, he contrasted Western culture with that of Japan, the former characterized by “individualism in the extreme, cut-throat competition exerting one’s utmost energy, feverish laboring to acquire as much luxury and indulgences as possible,” the latter by “harmony and equanimity, strong family bonds and public civility enforced by social norms.” “The Japanese rightfully admires the intellectual achievements of the West and immerses himself successfully and with great idealism in the sciences. But let him not thereby forget to keep pure the great attributes in which he is superior to the West—the artful shaping of life, modesty and unpretentiousness in his personal needs, and the purity and calm of the Japanese soul”.

The caucasian race severely disliked other races, they neutered mongoloid women in Greenland, North Europe, and spread propaganda on how “violent and savage” Genghis Khan was. Even though Covid was an American government funded project, called it “China disease” and spread the news all over the world.

In Hiroshima: The World’s Bomb, Andrew Rotter suggests that racism explains, at least in part, the decision to drop the bomb for diplomatic reasons at the expense of Japanese lives. He writes, “White American racism caused, or at minimum enabled, the United States to use a devastating weapon on the Japanese, brown people whom they considered inferior to themselves, barbaric in their conduct of war, and finally subhuman—‘a beast,’ as Truman put it”. Rotter suggests American anti-Japanese racism accounts for the genocidal expenditure of non-white lives for diplomatic reasons. This American antiJapanese racism, Rotter notes, manifested itself in the aesthetic portrayal of Japanese people as “subhuman”. The misrepresentation of Japanese people as subhuman narrates an unreal hierarchy of race in which white Americans are humans and Japanese are not. American anti-Japanese racism resulted in the framing of the Japanese people as subhuman, which in turn enabled the use of the atomic bomb on the Japanese people, not for pragmatic or expedient reasons, but to demonstrate “American military might” to the Soviet Union. I argue that American anti-Japanese racism enabled the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. American narratives of race fostered antipathy toward the Japanese to the extent that the Japanese became expendable. The accumulation of an increasingly racist anti-Japanese popular aesthetic, which took the form of textual, visual, musical and filmic propaganda, resulted in the animalization and subsequent dehumanization of the Japanese people. This dehumanization allowed for the “ethical” bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for diplomatic advantage with Russia. I conclude the aesthetic, and its accumulation, possesses the ethical power to condition genocide and America’s dehumanizing aesthetical narratives of the Japanese people enabled the murder of 105,000 Japanese and other non-white people.

Everyone have different opinions unlike Americans.), nor have any basic education. You are a Christian yet haven’t reached a level of an understanding a foreigner did.

How many times US keeps deceiving the world just to justify the colonization in a name of “protecting the country”? Just to name a few;

• US deceived the Native Americans and stole America and says “The Only Good Indians are the Dead Indians” keeps calling them “indians” which was a mistake to begin with.

• US deceived Japan that US will protect Japan against the aggression of Britain when they received a fake permission to force open Japan. On the side, US told China US must protect China from Japan. 

• US says they will protect Japan from China and North Korea to demilitarize Japan and make it a submissive country, while US controls China and North Korea (UK already colonized China in the Opium war, had the British Hong Kong. US funds the Chinese military and lab. After the WWII, US officially colonized South Korea and Russia colonized North Korea.) 
Then, militarize again to make an excuse “they’re aggressive and have to be eliminated”.

If any country started attacking, it is always the US behind their back and calling them ""evil"".

They discuss how they used the bombs to save GI lives but there wasn't enough impact to make you question if it was worth it. We heard how many Japanese died from the bombings and after but those are just numbers, nothing was shown.

The movie focused so much on the Communists, spies (without ever focusing in on the spies), and the wrongs done to Oppenheimer that it missed so much more thought provoking topics.

I love history and go to sleep reading a history book nightly. The topic can he incredibly engrossing or it can be incredibly boring.

">  Every since he got rid of his Editor, Lee Smith, and Hans Zimmer, his movies have been too quickly edited, less interesting stories, and filled with music that is ill-suited for the scenes.

I mean I don't see any particular decline in quality besides in his audio editing which is a deliberate artistic choice (particularly bad in TENET) but not too bad in this movie.  But I won't quibble about the issues with the technical aspets.

> Also his disdain for women in his work is something that makes his filmography increasingly problematic to me.

I literally don't see any disdain for women in this movie at all.  And I'm trying to think back at his other more recent movies.  Maybe there's stuff I'm forgetting.  I thought the main woman character--that tall blonde woman--was pretty interesting and at times ""badass"" in TENET (although I also think a woman being ""badass"" as a form of empowerment can be a pretty shallow form of ""writing good women"" but it wasn't too bad in that movie).  I don't remember any women in Dunkirk.  Elliot-then-Ellen Page's role as Aradne in Inception I think was also pretty well done?  It's been a while but I don't remember any ""hatred of women"" written into his role.

In this movie, we have two main woman characters; one of them an unstable communist paramour who took her own life.  I actually *love* the communist characters in this movie and found them to full of integrity and passion, and I think this character was a part of that.  She was a real life person, who really did have an affair with Oppenheimer, and really did commit suicide.  Her death was a huge blow to him.  I don't really see how the movie ""hates"" her.  And the second main character, Kitty, was very supportive while having a backbone.  Her scene during the hearing was one of the best parts of the film, and also quoted directly from history.  There was also a great rejoinder by one of the woman scientists in which she points out that her male colleagues are more suceptible to radiation poisoning in their reproductive system than hers.  

I simply don't see any valid argument that James Cameron ""hates"" women or views them as sexual objects in this film.  And, given the time period, women are pretty well-represented, albeit all in relation to Oppenheimer...but it was the 40s, what are you going to do?

> I just feel like her being nude was unnecessary because it was clearly done to arouse the viewer and if it wasn't, then why have her breasts in frame with erect nipples and in focus during the seated conversation scene or during the trial fantasy?

*Titanic* is more liekly to have been done to ""arouse the viewer"" and to put butts in seats.  That was a love story, and sexuality/sensuality is necessarily a part of it.  Arousal isn't, actually, a negative emotion, and it heightens a love story by putting you into the shoes of at least one of the characters.  When you see Rose's breasts in Titanic, you are put into Leo's shoes as you're put into this moment of intimacy and budding romance between two soon-to-be-lovers.  It was respectfully done, and it represents real life.

I dont' really see how this movie did it differently.

As I mentioned, the hearing scene was to make people uncomfortable.  The private details of his affair were being aired out in front of his life, so just as he WAS naked in front of Jean, he FELT naked in front of that committee.  

> Why was he seated weirdly cross-legged in a prudish manner hiding his genitals from the camera, it would be more realistic to have them sitting without regard to that

So your solution for mild nudity in the film (female breasts) is to have more extreme nudity (full genitalia of both a male and female)?  I woulnd't actually be upset by this...nudity is simply nudity.  I wouldn't be surprised if Oppenheimer raised the idea to CIllian, and he said no.  Cillian *did* appear naked in the film, even if you can't see his penis, so it wasn't like it wasn't uncomfortable for him.  Pugh has appeared nude in multiple movies, and I'm seeing discussion that she purposely *psuhed* the nude scene in the film.  Many actresses are like that...they see nudity as empowering.  

> The movie is too quick and it failed to make me care about hidden meanings when I can't follow the basic plot on screen.

Maybe you have ADHD.  A lot fo people in my generation and the zoomer generation are like that.  I'm sorry you felt that way.  However, I think you went into this film with a certain frame of mind to view it as anti-woman, but you don't really show how it's anti-woman, except by being upset that women have breasts and sometimes these breasts are visible.  It's not like this is a national lampoon movie where the whole point is to basically be a strip show, objectifying women the whole time.  If there's evidence that Nolan pushed for the nude scene hard, and Pugh really didn't want to do it, then I'd agree with you.

It seems like instead we had a  conversation that was like:

Nolan: ""there will be a nude scene, toplessness only, and it will be extended, but it makes sense as you are having an affair with Oppenheimer""

Pugh: ""I'm fine with that""",2023-07-22 14:50:19

From a quick google search you can find many quotes from people who were there which directly disapprove your point: “No one who saw it could forget it, a foul and awesome display.” - Kenneth Bainbridge.

As for every important decision being made by people quipping in a room, that makes me feel like you have never spoken to another human being anymore. Real people do not talk like they do in this film. This is an issue I have with a lot of films (hence why I prefaced that critique by saying it may be due to my personal opinion). The dialogue is too perfect, it is not realistic and (in my opinion) it is pretentious and, to be honest, cringeworthy.

And thank you for going through my post history and using it to make a personal jab at me, really tells me a lot about your character, you must be very mature and much, much more intelligent than me, I am just a business student.

Also, I think you’re missing my point about the scale. I don’t care if the explosion was technically the right size for how far away the characters were. The way that it was shot and conveyed onto the screen made it seem like a small explosion. That was why I feel there was not a sense of scale.",2023-07-25 13:16:10
The explosion was barely shown and wasn't what a nuclear bomb looks like in real life. You're just not correct on that front. Why are you so aggressively defending something that clearly got it wrong.,2023-07-25 13:27:03
"This movie doesn't need to be 2 and half hours long of one minute fast cuts of constant expositions. No movie is ever good for being that. 

Lots of questionable time jumps, unrealistic overly profound dialogue, insignificant scenes with epic orchestra score that isn't earned. Virtually the entirety of the third act was just RDJ expositioning to the audience what happened and what is happening by having a conversation with his aides that's been fast cut to barely cohesive shreds. 

This is not a good movie neither as a biopic nor documentary about Oppenheimer.",2023-07-25 15:53:15
"I genuinely don’t believe something like Indy 5 justified costing as much as all three original films put together - do you?? It also hasn’t made its money back, which just further puts a choke hold on hollywoods willingness to pay out for future projects. I don’t doubt Nolan’s film will make its money back, but there’s no denying that movies are getting insanely expensive. 200m used to be the high bar; now it’s the standard. 300m for the new Mission Impossible.. that was unheard of just a few years ago - the cost of this film has almost doubled it’s budget.. it’s not a huge deal but it’s worth discussing at least",2023-07-21 15:44:55
"Never said that he needs anything, but you cannot deny that he is profiting off the crowd that would normally only watch Barbie who are also seeing Oppenheimer for the meme. Barbie is the more universally accessible film and has tripled Oppen’s gross revenue already so it’s obvious that Barbie is going to carry Oppen a bit due to the Barbenheimer memes lol. I’m not a Nolan fan but I still did the whole Barbenheimer thing and most of the crowd at my Oppen showing were in pink 😂

There are several interviews where Nolan stated he won’t be seeing Barbie and rumblings that he was less than thrilled regarding the dual release date but in the end it’s bringing more people to theatres and both films will profit heavily off the memes so 🤷‍♀️

I brought up my brother and my own experiences because I realised that I am coming to the film from a perspective totally different to most other people.

For example, when Teller's calculations suggest that >!the bomb could ignite the atmosphere!< they don't immediately say what his calculations suggest for a couple of scenes.

Nolan chose not to give us any point of view on his character, which is ok, if you give your audience time to think and make up their mind about it. This bulldozer of a movie leaves no room for processing. You're bombarded with non stop dialogue and music, trying to make sense of this chronological mess while keeping track of who's who.

Answer these questions if you can:

*How much do you think you actually learn about Oppenheimer just from watching the movie? Did you find out how Oppenheimer was raised? What were his parents like? What got him into physics in the first place? What drove him? What were his goals? Why was he sympathetic to communism?*

Stop pretending you have actually sat through this 3 hour drag of a failed biopic and jump on the ""NOLANISGOAT"" fad bandwagon praising how this is the second coming of Christ for cinema lol",2023-08-02 19:20:50
Agreed. So many subplot lines that were never followed. Why show us these details if they have no relevance to the story?,2023-07-31 16:32:07
"It actually does. Because the main crux of him being thrown under the bus is because of his communist connections that the AEC exploited. This is the premise of the entire third act.

So why was Oppenheimer sympathetic to communist cause? Why was he drawn to it? What exactly were the consequences of the atomic bombs in Japan that led him to an evidential moral dilemma?

We were never shown any of of the above in a 3 hour long film. The main purpose of a movie should be to show, not tell, otherwise it may as well be a podcast or a book.",2023-07-30 20:44:50

"> Nolan's Trinity test doesn't match up very well with the archival footage of the Trinity test

How so? The archival footage of the Trinity test is low fidelity black-and-white capturing of what is very obviously a _fireball_ - the first feature to form post-explosion flash - which is what Oppenheimer is looking at through the instrument.

The gigantic mushroom cloud people seem to be hankering for takes _minutes_ to fully form, not the literal seconds (the sound hadn't even reached them yet!) that Nolan was trying to portray.",2023-07-22 18:02:30
Lmao that in itself is the glorification of nukes in media ☠️. The fact that a vast majority of pepper who went to see Oppenheimer didn’t care about the movie before hand and just went to watch the explosion is self explanatory.,2023-07-24 00:35:39
I don’t consider myself a critic as long as a movie is entertaining that’s all that matters to me. But yeah the average viewer probably went in to see the bomb go off I value their opinion and at least hope they enjoyed most of the movie cause it was 3 hours long that’s allot of time to set aside for a movie.,2023-07-22 19:45:45

"Idk what to tell you man. Just watched the movie and if you even remotely payed attention to the final dialogue between Einstien and Oppenheimer there is no mistaking the meaning of the final shot. The discussion is literally about the Fermi predictions of the atmosphere igniting and Oppenheimers last words to Einstien were ""I believed it."" As in he believed the mathematical calculations and went ahead with the launch anyways. Which lines up with one of the main themes of the movie being about Oppenheimers moral ambiguity. Nothing in that convo was about Oppenheimers belief about the metaphorical chain reaction nukes would have on society. Pay attention before you go correction people.

Edit: I'm eating my words because I was wrong.",2023-07-26 21:04:30
"I've never needed likable characters to become engrossed in a story, so Oppenheimer and RDJ being unlikable doesn't bother me at all. One of the reasons impacted me personally was seeing the way Oppenheimer was treated by those in power in the government for the country that he diligently worked to serve. And then to see them try to reconcile the wrongs and unfair treatment they gave him at the very end during the Einstein conversation, when really it was all just for show and for their own designs, not because they genuinely felt sorry for him was a striking message. That's why seeing Damon's character be the only one who really stuck by Oppenheimer that entire time was so powerful to me personally. Oppenheimer was a man who gave his country the most powerful weapon the world ever saw, and even with his past connections remained loyal to the USA to the end, never revealing a single secret. And then to see the classic DC politician attempt to destroy him because he said things they didn't like was a slap in the face to Oppenheimer and everyone who gives service to their country. That's why seeing RDJ not get the cabinet position mattered to me, and why seeing Groves and the other scientists rally behind Oppenheimer was so satisfying. 

Personally just how I reacted to the themes around service for one's country and what being a patriot is. Oppenheimer by all accounts in the film was one, even after the kangaroo prosecution. Einstein's conversations touched on these themes well throughout the final act of the movie too. The fact that Oppenheimer might not be super likable wasn't relevant to me, considering the injustices he faced which massively overshadowed any personal flaws he might have had.",2023-07-23 04:48:54

""People that did not like this movie, did not think it was too hard to get. It was very easy to understand. It used frenetic editing and needless convolusion to mimic complexity. It was not complex. People that liked it keep commenting and saying the people that did not like are not sophisticated enough to get it. Because they are faux intellectual dipshits.""

The fact that you couldn't parse that and completely missed my point confirms my suspicions. The fact that somebody called me a soyboy confirms my suspicions.

Everyone in my group was laughing at how bad the third hour was.  I mean they could've spent more time on the Manhattan Project developing the bombing. The fallout in Japan. The war itself to show why Oppenheimer and the government are so motivated. The continued proliferation of atomic weapons and the cold war nuclear arsenals.

"I'd give you Christianity and Bible. 

But if you think Nolan could get away with a quote from the Quran and Torah in the same way.. Then we are living in two completely different worlds. Rihanna tried that for a song and she had to publicly apologize before a fatwa on her head lol. 

Who's calling Nolan racist for this? Not me. He's far more deserved of that title cause of his erasure of alamos hispanos completely from the story.. If we bring up racism in any context. 

The point remains the same. Some religions you can touch, some you cannot. Doesn't make what happened in the scene wrong, just makes it unequal in respect. Whether that respect is out of knowledge or fear of repercussions, that's another story.

Regarding the solar eclipse, the thing is to not stare at the sun during one -- looking at one for a brief moment is perfectly fine just like briefly looking at the sun is perfectly fine. During an eclipse enough light is blocked to not trigger the natural response to squint and therefore avoid damaging you eyes with UV light exposure.

"American propaganda is the only reason why the Japanese Empire isn’t reviled like the Nazis are. I suggest you educate yourself on the pacific theater of WW2. Perhaps you should learn more about how Japan colonized, raped, and genocided more than 30 million people, most of them civilians, across the continent of Asia. That is 5x the amount of Jews that were killed during the Holocaust. Japan never would have surrendered, they were arming their children to continue fighting on. They were happy to perpetrate some of the worst crimes against humanity. But I guess that doesn’t matter to you, is it because their victims were Asians?",2023-07-30 09:25:17

"I said elsewhere Strauss’s perspective was established in the opening scenes as being the secondary main storyline. So that’s to be expected. I don’t really care about the one second of Kitty riding a horse to find Opps because that scene was still all about him anyway. 

The chair scene was just gratuitous. She didn’t need to be fully naked to that extent on screen and they could’ve done it literally any other way. Literally just had one POV shot from Kitty where side chick is visible over Opps shoulder. Hell you could just zoom in on Kitty’s face and her expression would’ve made it perfectly clear.

Truman being a racist? Yup. It was implied when he called Oppenheimer a crybaby for being upset about the deaths of (what he thought was) tens of thousands. It was implied by his framing of ""saving American lives,"" i.e. white.

The person saying that Kyoto is a beautiful city and they shouldn't bomb it? That's not a choice by the filmmakers to justify bombing Hiroshima or Nagasaki. It's to show the disgusting amount of power that these people had over millions of lives--and how they are so incredibly ignorant of how to use it. To think that someone chose not to massacre everyone in a city....not for any specific strategic reason, but because they vacationed there. The person said not to bomb Kyoto because it was a cultural center, forgetting that when you bomb ANYWHERE you are destroying cultural elements no matter what: human lives and stories, homes, community centers, places of worship, etc etc etc. It's inane. It's supposed to make the person look bad for making that decision such a nonchalant manner, as if it's deciding what to eat for dinner instead of deciding the place where you will murder innocent civilians.

Oppenheimer quoting ""I am become death"" is not justifying anything, either. There is no indication that him reading it means that he is religious. He simply makes the connection when he witnesses, for the first time, the testing of the most destructive weapon that has ever existed. He is not saying it in prayer. He is saying it because he realizes the horror of what they have unleashed--it is a weapon that can *literally* destroy the world, as shown again and again by the conversation about nuclear arms races (and the talks about the atmosphere catching on fire and destroying the planet).",2023-11-19 04:36:28

"Due to the extremely secretive nature of US-led censorship in Japan, few people knew that censorship existed. Its existence was kept secret, and the only ones aware of it were those directly in contact with the censors - writers, editors, and journalists.\[45\] However, its inner workings have influenced the landscape of post-war Japan leaving a lasting impact on its society.

One of the most controversial and difficult to censor topics impacting Occupation forces’ reputation were the after-effects of the two nuclear bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. U.S. officials both within the United States and in Japan immediately worked to suppress information about the effects of nuclear radiation.\[19\] While the blast of the bomb was celebrated by President Truman’s radio broadcast as a powerful weapon of war, information about the resulting radiation deaths and illnesses caused by the atomic bombs were suppressed by officials.\[20\] Medical reports, case notes, and other records collected by Japanese medical professionals who treated survivors at Hiroshima were confiscated by American officers and remained classified for years.\[21\] Occupation officials outright denied radiation effects and censored public criticism of the U.S. bombings.\[22\] They labeled Japanese and European reports of lingering “radioactive poison gas” as “propaganda”, most likely wishing to avoid international stigma surrounding chemical weapons, which had been banned during the First World War.\[23\]

The CCD specifically undertook the censorship of public opinion in the press, publication, film, television, and radio, as well as monitoring the postal letters, phone calls, and telegram.\[1\] In this period, more than 200 million letters, 136 million telegrams and 800,000 telephone calls from Japanese citizens were monitored.\[12\] To assess telephone calls, 63 Japanese and 12 foreigners monitored calls throughout Japan by using 70 eavesdropping devices; for postal surveillance, 4,000 Japanese and 60 Americans sampled 2% of domestic correspondence; and finally for telegraphs, 100 Japanese and 12 American workers sampled 15% of total telegrams.\[13\]

\* “...\[N\]o destructive criticism of the Allied Forces of Occupation and nothing which might invite mistrust or resentment of those troops.”

\* No “false or destructive criticism of the Allied Powers,” which included criticisms of General MacArthur and SCAP.

\* No “mention of the “fraternization” between Occupation troops and Japanese, and of involvement of soldiers with the black market.”

\* No “dissemination of extremely pessimistic views of the food shortage.”

Because one's history is being told within the context of the thing they break off to? They aren't leaving randomly, they're interrupting by jumping to event that are the reason why the story is told in the movie in the first place.

> They stray from that countless times.

Not at all. The story had three layers. The Secretary hearings, the security clearance hearing, and events from Oppenheimer's life. The Secretary hearings were dominated by the topic of security clearance hearings, which were all about Oppenheimer's work *and* his personal life, his character.

"I don't believe the claim that theatres were given instructions to zoom in portions of the film just because you saw a viewing of a different movie that didn't have issues. 

I don't even know how they would begin to do that either, considering most films are just received on a hard drive these days. By what means would they be able to go in and time zooms throughout the film? Especially in a film like Oppenheimer where the aspect ratio can change a dozen times in a minute. There's no way the studio, or Christopher Nolan would expect the movie theatres to alter the film in that way. 

The theatres are responsible to play the film as received. If the theatre is playing the film in a widescreen format, and the screen itself is taller than the projection, you will see black bars on top and bottom. When the film aspect ratio changes to the 4:3 (rounding, of course) then the film would be seen with black bars on the left and right, AND top and bottom since the overall presentation's vertical resolution wouldn't change.

If the theatres screen matches the aspect ratio of the movie, then you would only see black bars on the left and right of the film during the 4:3 shots, and no black bars at all for the widescreen shots",2023-07-31 10:43:40

>People who can’t stand non linear story telling at all.

This is an oversimplification, most people are okay with some degree of non-linear storytelling. You'll never hear anyone here criticize Pulp Fiction.

The criticism that I've seen is that it's impossible to get attached the story or characters because the movie jumps around between three or four different eras in Oppenheimer's life. If you're going to defend the non-linear storytelling, you have to make the argument that the lack of linearity actually benefits the story, characters, and themes. Which, in the assessment of myself and many others, it doesn't.

>People who can’t stand dialogue

People can't stand the dialogue because the dialogue is bad. It is stilted and cheesy and cliched. Matt Damon yelling ""How about because this is the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world!"" is ridiculously cheesy and melodramatic. Kitty Oppenheimer's dialogue is basically every disgruntled wife character from every movie rolled into one. Everyone's already talked about the destroyer of worlds scene, but it is dumb.

>The sex scene in particular was so distasteful and it feels so forced and cringe.

Agreed. The second scene especially was just unnecessary- I haven't seen any valid explanation as to why it exists. I feel like the film could've gotten away with 0 sex scenes, thus avoiding the R rating entirely and it wouldn't have turned out worse.

>but the issue is that the movie is still boring, awfully edited and hard to watch.

Their entire plan was to bait the USN into one decisive battle and failing that attrit them and grind them down through a series of battles without losing the absolute defensive line

their terms, ceding that this plan did not work were *status quo antebellum*. Basically this is like if, in 1944, the nazis said ""time out, we want to surrender. But we keep austria, the studetenland, and don't lose any territory. 

The japanese also wanted to keep their current regime in charge. Much hay is made about Hirohito keeping his head, but this was american wisdom. Even though Hirohito kept his head, the Emperor died.

"I'm reading the actual testimony of Dr. Hill during the confirmation hearings, it's quite fascinating. He goes a lot into how Strauss forced a sham hearing into Oppenheimer's security credentials, still working through that part.

But ultimately it seems like his disapproval of Strauss is that he is a controlling dickhead that most scientists couldn't stand. Fermi's only press conference was to bash a book about the H-Bomb that gave way too much credit to Teller and Strauss, and that apparently Strauss had fed all the information to the authors. And Dr. Hill included a remark that Einstein apparently made about working under Strauss at Princeton:

> I would rather choose to be a plumber or a peddler in the hope to find that modest degree of independence still available under present circumstances.

So yeah, it wasn't anything that Oppenheimer said to Einstein, he just fucking hated Strauss apparently.

He was probably peeved that people like Oppenheimer felt guilty about it, as if it was their decision to authorize the use of the weapon and kill all those people.

"I am aware of what they said. 

What they don't mention in there comments is that at that time the US military was undergoing huge changes because of the bomb. They were facing massive cuts to their budgets and individuals wanted to protect their own branches of the military. Army generals didn't want the government to think the bomb could replace the army. 

The air force was created after the war. The other branches worried they'd get all the funding. Their comments reflect that. 

The generals statements offer insight. But precisely because they were in the moment, their reflections are difficult to accept at face value (similar to any other historic event). 

Let's also remember the US needed to justify nobody ever using the bomb again. Their statements reflect that as well. 

Eisenhower (who I love btw) was commander in Europe not the pacific.

They may have believed the bomb was not needed. But they didn't know what the Japanese were doing inside their own borders and how they felt. The country was not going to surrender short of believing total annihilation with no hope of retaliation was coming. That may be difficult to accept. But it is the truth.

He's portrayed as extremely hawkish and willing to maliciously abuse the system to get what he wants. My theater cheered when he's ""defeated"" at his confirmation—particularly at the ""led by a junior senator from Massachusetts named Kennedy"" line. I don't think that happens if we're supposed to think that Strauss was justified. 

Just talking to how they're depicted in the movie, I can't speak to these figures in real life—I admittedly walked in knowing basically nothing about Oppenheimer besides ""atomic bomb guy"" and the famous ""death destroyer of worlds"" quote.

Here's another article for reference:

>Digital projection can look very good—especially at a high-quality IMAX, a Dolby Cinema, or another premium format—but film has a higher resolution and a different aspect ratio than digital, which means the digital version of the film will be cropped horizontally compared to the 70mm version, a phenomenon movie nerds have taken to calling “Croppenheimer.”

"I agree. I have been fascinated with Oppenheimer for a long time, for all his flaws. What he achieved was amazing, but ultimately the consequences were outside of his control.

I don't know if this was intentional, but in the scene in which Jean (Florence Pugh) asks him to read from the Bhagavad-Gita, he starts by trying to explain the context that Arjuna finds himself, but Jean says she wants him to read the words. So he does ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"".

I don't know if you have read the Bhagavad Gita, but the context Oppenheimer is trying to give is that Arjuna doesn't want to commit to war against his kin, but Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) convinces Arjuna that it is his dharma (i.e. ""duty"") to wage war.

In that moment where she tells him to read the words it reflects the expectation that he just does the maths, without the broader context and without his ethical agency.

"I think that was the nuance of his character- he never truly wore his heart on his sleeve 

He was tied with lots of liberal causes that put him very near lots of convicted communists and part of communist gatherings pre Manhattan Project. Did he believe in some of what they did? Maybe. Did he believe in treason? No. Everything else is a bit murky - the brand of communism be believed in though wasnt the Red communism, rather more so helping refugees etc. At the time though he had to play with what the politics was in the room otherwise he could have been charges with worse than security clearance issues

He was both shown to be regretful of aspects of the bomb, but not of others. The objective black and white view shows Strauss complaining near the end of how Oppenheimer probably likes being the matyr figure who was the father of the atom bomb at times as it led him to be able to advocate against further bomb creation. At the time of the bombing itself he did feel regret for the victims - but also held dual beliefs that the bomb itself may have been a necessary evil provided it stopped further Atomic bomb creation. His growing regret and wish to meet Truman etc was due to USA not showing like they will stop, if anything it looked like he set off a big arms race which is what he truly regretted most. 

Cilian Murphy acted the heck out of showing that ambiguity and tug and pull of ideals. A man who seemed to have some ideals, but also wasnt the best moral person, who would play with the trust of the women in his life, but then also ironically wish that the government would keep trust in him (rather than using him for his worth at the time)",2023-07-29 08:09:19

">Because one's history is being told within the context of the thing they break off to? They aren't leaving randomly, they're interrupting by jumping to event that are the reason why the story is told in the movie in the first place.  


Can you rephrase this? Are you trying to discuss the reasoning for perspective shifts?

> The story had three layers. 

Yes, I'm being hyperbolic. Three different framing devices is still a lot.

>Why? The movie delivered exactly what you specified in the post I replied to. 

No, it did not deliver on that. It is one thing to subtly reference something and to actually show it.

>Why is that insufficient?

Showing the actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki could have created a more visceral and emotional response from the viewer. While internalizing guilt is an effective narrative technique, it pales to witnessing the immediate consequences.

I'm *by no means* saying it is invalid to deal with in abstract like the movie did with the gymnasium scene. It is a matter of artistic taste, and a matter of case-by-case. For example say you and I did a movie about the Nuremberg trial and discuss if we should flashback to showing innocents being gassed, or if we should just artistically reference it. Both are two strong artistic paths to take.  

But in this hyperspecific scenario and context (Nolan's Oppenheimer) showing would've been the stronger artistic statement (in my humble opinion).",2023-08-08 15:56:20
"I'm a physicist. He's cool but pales in scientific achievements compared to others. He's still pretty well known - exactly as expected as he did that other great thing. I don't think he's either over nor underrated if you will. He was well known before and after his clearance thing. Which freckly today no one knows about, particularly outside of the us.

And there were several jump scares. I will not watch a 3hr camrip of a shitty movie again (or ever really).",2023-08-20 20:13:20
"First of all, it wasn’t *the entire audience.* I don’t know a single person who watched and loved that show that would argue they watched it primarily for the narrative plot. The creators have said that it is a character drama. But sure, if random inm808 on Reddit says it’s true, I guess the audience, creators, writers, and critics must all be wrong. 

You also haven’t made a single argument supporting your opinion, you just keep stating things as fact. So either you don’t know how to argue your point or you just can’t think of a good response. It’s okay, I’m sure Michael Bay will have another movie coming out again soon that you can talk about on your forums until you’ve figured out how to watch and appreciate a movie with a plot other than “A happened, then B happened, then C happened.”",2023-07-28 17:20:24

Yeah. What people are saying is that *his attempt to communicate that was poor.* 

Just because it attempted to communicate the importance, just because in real life it was important, does not mean that the movie is good.

I pointed that out by referring to the last two minutes of the movie. My assertion and the assertion of many others is that *it fell flat* because his *execution* was off.

""It was really important and the director was trying to communicate that."" So has every director of every shitty historical movie ever.

">Although, I will say that the criticisms of the Trinity test scene are valid. It just doesn't look like a nuke.

That's fair though I disagree, especially in the later shots, looks exactly like the trinity video I've seen. For me it's good enough. Having one done with CGI or whatever wouldn't have added much value for me. 

&#x200B;

>The criticism that I've seen is that it's impossible to get attached the story or characters because the movie jumps around between three or four different eras in Oppenheimer's life. If you're going to defend the non-linear storytelling, you have to make the argument that the lack of linearity actually benefits the story, characters, and themes. Which, in the assessment of myself and many others, it doesn't.

This is in the minority from what I've read on here. Most people complain it's confusing and they can't follow it. I view as just a different way to tell the story. It's part of the art. I didn't have an issue getting attached to the story or characters but if others didn't, that's fair. 

>People can't stand the dialogue because the dialogue is bad. It is stilted and cheesy and cliched. Matt Damon yelling ""How about because this is the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world!"" is ridiculously cheesy and melodramatic. Kitty Oppenheimer's dialogue is basically every disgruntled wife character from every movie rolled into one. Everyone's already talked about the destroyer of worlds scene, but it is dumb. I could name more examples, but this wall of text is long enough.

Even if I agreed that a few lines were ""cheesy"" I wouldn't blanket the entire dialogue as a whole bad. As for Matt's line, thats exactly what a no nonsense lieutenant general would say. And, it was one of the most important things to happen to the world. Now maybe you didn't like the delivery of it, which is fair. 

&#x200B;

>You're just listing things at this point. The complaints about the sound and audio are valid, as far as I'm concerned.

&#x200B;

Yeah I was listing the top complaints. And I don't think they are. Seen it twice and had zero issue understanding the talking. The rest of it is personal taste. Music didn't bother me, but it obviously bothers others.",2023-08-07 23:00:00
"> Im upset because trailers lied me and you are protecting this bulshit.

But they didn't lie to you. It's very obvious from the trailer that they use his title of ""father of the atomic bomb"" as the center of the story, and then build suspense around the fact that he has to deal with the politics of it afterwards.

You came into the trailer and film lying to yourself. Nolan didn't lie to you. I don't care if you didn't like the film, but you're trying to impress your opinion as a fact.

"and who is “they’re” in this scenario dumbass? Putting aside the fact that your response makes no sense, there’s still the issue of dialogue being drowned out by the score in an exposition heavy movie.

I’m interested in history and geopolitics, she isn’t but still wants to see the movie with me.

"I get where you're coming from, but it's funny to me you're talking about being unoriginal when there are only so many opinions and stories for that matter. It all boils down to some variation of I liked it, no.issues, I liked it but have some criticism, neutral or they didn’t like it, they didn't  like it but liked some other aspect of the production. 

People in general care way too much about what other people think about art or anything. They mistake someone expressing their opinion for them, declaring it  to be a statement of fact when that's not remotely the case. 

Or they think that person likes something I don't like and are happy or dislike something I like, and I tied my identity to that one thing, so thats a personal attack on me and if I'm wrong about that one thing what else have I been wrong about? Now that's unoriginal, and we're all guilty of it.

One of the reasons I initially mentioned people not being aware of their history is that most Americans aren't to a large degree. Most of the country can't even read at an eighth grade level. I understand that some people are more fortunate than others and have had better opportunities, but it is mildly frustrating when you do hear something you enjoy being critiqued by people who don't really have the background to  understand it. Again, that's not saying you HAVE to have that background to enjoy the film on its own merits; people are.free to engage with things the way they want to but you're definitely going to understand more and appreciate it if you have a familiarity with the subject matter.",2023-07-23 01:13:02

"> You don’t know why I was confused that Nolan decided to have one bombastic scene where he and his girlfriend are naked in front of a clothed board, but then never employed anything remotely that weird in the rest of the movie?

The cuts to visual effects depicting a fission reaction.  

The scene in the gym where it was literally louder than the shockwave from the bomb, even though the gym only had a couple dozen people.

These have to be used sparingly, otherwise it risks creative license going overboard.  I still do not know why you have a problem with this.

>I spent the whole movie shaking my head that this wasn’t done by someone who knew what they were doing.

"Did he?! I can’t remember that at all. For me this is like Tenet all over again when I could only fully work out what was happening by going online after the movie and getting bits explained to me.

I’m really not a stupid person so perhaps it’s Nolan’s style I can’t jibe with but I do think he makes it very hard to follow some plot points. Like Aaron Sorkin uses a lot of dense language but usually you can still follow the main plot in his scripts. With Nolan I think he’s always trying to do twists and surprise people and in doing so just loses the audience at least in Tenet and Oppenheimer.

"You didn't rebut with data points. You rebutted with a list of some of his films with your opinions noted in the margins.

I do not agree Memento and Interstellar has great female characters. I think they're all 2-dimensional paper dolls Nolan uses to get his male leads emotionally invested in the plot. I think you conveniently omitted Inception which has some of his worst representation of women of his career. And I think that just because a film has a military setting doesn't mean every female character should be relegated to bland love interest. It may be a shock to you but women did actually exist in the 1940s and 50s.

I'd give Dunkirk a pass because it's taking (primarily) on an actual battlefield during an real war. Tenet is a scifi future so there really is no excuse. And Oppenheimer decided to make its only female characters exist solely to make Oppy feel guilty (and also sleep with him.)",2023-07-26 06:13:54

Only your lack of reading comprehension and your short temper and insecurity are shining through. I see that some people have looked down on your MBA so I’m sure there’s a little bit of resentment and embarrassment fuelling this fire.

Like I just said, if the bomb explosion in the film is technically accurate, that’s great! Do you know what I mean when I say “scale” in regards to the scene in the film? Because I don’t think you do. What I am saying is that, despite how realistic it may have been, it was not impressive in the film. This is as a result of the way the scene was shot and edited. I feel as if this did not allow the explosion scene to have the sense of SCALE and impact that it should have. I don’t even really know why we’re arguing about this, it’s sort of down to personal preference, but, of course your personal preference is probably right though, seeing as you are obviously much smarter than me.

That’s a great strawman argument there. I like how you’re preemptively getting angry at my responses. Very intelligent discussion. 

As for what I said before, this is probably down to personal preference. I don’t really like it when a film which has such fast, quippy dialogue, it just doesn’t feel realistic to me and I don’t find it cool or funny, I just don’t like it. But again, what do I know?",2023-07-25 14:04:39

I do understand the stylistic intention and I do respect it. In this current climate of films which seems to be so dominated by franchises and sequels and remakes j really, really appreciate films like Oppenheimer and I think it’s incredible how an almost 3 hour long biopic has become so successful.

I do like the symbolism in the gymnasium scene and its similarities to nazi rallies, I do feel as if it was effective at conveying the emotions it was trying too.

As for the bomb explosion. I do recognise why Nolan would hold back from showing it in its entirety. I just my critique of that is down to personal preference. I suppose, after how it had been hyped up (which admittedly is a negative of hype and not the actual film itself) I was expecting more and so when I first saw it I was a little disappointed.

Again, Oppenheimer was TELLING the committee, and by proxy, the audience, why he might have been interested and had connections with Communist members. But it wasn't SHOWN. Show us why he was even interested in Communism to begin with, how did the political ideology align wih his person beliefs and moral compass?

And yes, I would very much like the movie to show audience the actual, direct consequences of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because this is something that 99% of modern audience in 2023 don't actually have an idea about. It would have be much more convincing and powerful as to why Oppenheimer had such a staunch reaction to the development of H-Bomb if we are actually shown the direct human consequences and the extent of destruction of nuclear weapons.

"Im not even American and didnt know the story and I got it pretty easily - they discuss in a scene how his security clearance loss would lose him all credibility within the field, and his credibility to advocate against hydrogen bomb testing and creation…..

"It doesn’t even matter if you understand American history because they don’t even properly highlight why the “unreliable narrator” angle is even relevant until the last third of the movie which makes the whole RDJ heel-turn fall flat and (in my opinion) really hurts the viewer’s immersion in the narrative.

Its one thing to reference events that will be fully explained later to build intrigue for the audience, but the structure of the movie means the first third was just referencing stuff that even outside the narrative you would have no context for unless you already knew the stories of all these characters. In that sense it is a movie that probably benefits from a rewatch, but I can’t help but feel like it would have been a lot less annoying and more impactful if it had just been re-edited into a straight biopic.

The way it is it feels like yet another instance of Christopher Nolan letting his ambition and “cleverness” get in the way of making an actually thematically coherent narrative.",2023-07-26 16:52:35

this was increasingly complicated by the army and the navy wanting different things, which made the government incredibly dysfunctional and resulted in a lot of politicians getting sworded by junior officers.

The scene itself was good, it is just underwhelming when you remember this is an R-Rated film. The excuse that he didn't see it directly is such a cop out since he still sees the bodies and the crying women anyway and he does come to know about other details of Hiroshima survivors through the radio that would have let him imagine it in more details

Again, it's a good scene but it lacks that punch. It feels like a generic way to represent the horrors of the atom bomb, which would have been fine had this movie just been a PG-13 romp but this was R-Rated, it could have done more.

What the film did and what I'm asking for isn't any different, I just wanted more visceral imagery that took advantage of the R-Rating but instead the rating hinges wholly on a laughable sex scene.",2023-07-31 06:32:00

It’s not like it’s unethical to view photos of the victims, is it? No, it depends on context. It wouldn’t be unethical to show CGI people dismembered to drive home what Oppenheimer felt guilty about, which they did anyway, just on white people because that’s how little they cared about confronting there reality of what he did. 

Do you oppose historical education? Should we whitewash everything for your sensibilities, and shield people’s reputation from their crimes?

It’s like when Game of Thrones was airing and there was a topless woman every 2.5 seconds but the male fans would rant and rave about the one dick shown in 9 seasons meant that there was male nudity “as well”. It’s a joke. There was no reason to have either sex scene shown in the film (and to have only adulterous sex scenes shown while wifey just obediently births kids off screen and weeps for three hours while being cheated on). Could’ve easily had both scenes without showing anything and actually keeping it “equal”.",2023-07-27 14:00:08

"I have to disagree. Showing the actual bombing would be boom boom bam bam to the viewer.

If you want to focus on big explosions and not artistry, like you're clearly saying here, not the characters, pick Bayformers instead.

The movie is very consistent. We are shown the ""present"" with Strauss, and the present was all about retelling the story of the security clearance hearing, which, in turn, was about Oppenheimer's life.

Those weren't three different framing devices, that was one framing device with three layers. If you can't tell the difference here, then all I can do is politely smile and walk away shaking my head. Each layer moved chronologically, and each layer portrayed the events in it consistently.

The official Oppenheimer aspect ratio guide for non Imax, digital screenings of the film is to display as a flat 2.2:1 projection inside a 1.85:1 letterbox which would result in black bars on the top and bottom of the screen for the widescreen portions of the film, and black bars all around the image for what would have been the Imax 70mm, taller shots.

"You are one extremely dense cookie. First of all, my original comment was in reply to someone who was making the point that the pivotal part of history that the hearing represented was the ""taking down of an American hero"". That's simply not true. The hearing had minimal effect on Oppenheimer's legacy. I noticed how you conveniently left out the end of my comment when you initially quoted me (""It was a behind-closed-doors private hearing which had the effect of not renewing a security clearance. **Hardly changed Americans' opinions of the man.""**).

But yes, let's go beyond that. Let's talk about Oppenheimer's ability to influence policy, which you steered me towards. Now you're saying that the all important effect of the revocation of his security clearance was NOT to do with the US pursuit of the H-bomb, but rather the all important effect was to do with Oppenheimer's ability to influence policy. How his ability to influence policy could be so important while simultaneously the realization of his most avowed policy position (i.e., against the H-bomb race) be so unimportant, one wonders!

The facts are that a) Oppenheimer's policy positions were already known well before his security clearance was revoked, b) the Truman administration had already established the policy direction of pursuing the H-bomb in 1950, well before his security clearance was revoked, c) his opposition to the H-bomb was on moral grounds, not out of strategic concerns, and d) the geopolitical realities of the cold war and strategic considerations dictated nuclear policy to a far greater extent than anything else.",2023-07-29 19:17:07

"The security clearance interview is what I was talking about. The actual sex scene wasn’t out of place. And even then, he didn’t use the same style for both scenes.

Sure. To being with, the visuals were all over the place, stylistically. In the beginning of the movie, Oppenheimer dreamed of atoms and flashes of electricity, and that all goes away about the third of the way through the film. Not too egregious, but noticeable.

Then almost every decision made about Strauss’s presentation was pretty sloppy. Like, during the Scooby Doo moment where Strauss was revealed to be some behind-the-scenes villain, there was audible confusion in my theater. Because outside of one anecdote about how he kind of got embarrassed by Oppenheimer one time, and then once offered him a job, no one knew who the fuck this guy was in relation to Oppenheimer. Sloppy.

And then the total lack of any kind of creative representation of Japan or the Japanese people when there must be, like, 20 instances of someone alluding to Oppenheimer’s guilt by saying “I know you feel guilty” is pretty freaking egregious.

It’s like saying the sky isn’t blue in your opinion, then going full man-baby keyboard warrior over people that point out how you’re wrong. Just silly. No point in arguing with a brick wall",2023-08-02 19:30:35

"I think if you want a deeper dive into the intricacies his beliefs, buy the biography.

And I think showing the bombs drop is overkill and unnecessary. We know what happened; two cities got obliterated. It also takes us out of the immersion of the time. The people who worked on the project built the bomb and then saw it picked up shipped off; they only heard about it on the radio that they were used. Oppenheimer never saw the death and destruction that they caused, he was only left to wonder about it for the rest of his life after witnessing the test.

That's literally what the scene is about when he gets a raucous ovation from the Los Alamos researchers and families, his thoughts were dominated by what his creation had actually been used to do a world away.",2023-07-30 21:18:31

"Lol you have no argument so this is the response I expected.

As for the intelligence comment, I apologize if it's too severe but you're misusing an incredibly common word and invalidating every film depicting nukes, regardless of their intent, themes, andr delivery.  If that's not ignorance or stupidity, what is it?  Do you truly believe that Oppenheimer is the first anti nuclear film, let alone one of the best ?  And again, I implore you to give concrete examples of films that glorify nuclear weapons",2023-07-24 02:30:59
"The box office is clearly due to reviews, the barbenheimer thing, and Nolan's own star power. The most obvious example of what this movie's box office would look like sans the last two is The Imitation Game, which only made 200m.

This isn't a movie people would normally turn out for otherwise. It's a niche film punching above it's weight due to marketing, native or otherwise.",2023-07-24 13:01:24
"There's plenty of 1 star reviews online you can go read. I gave it a 4, which for me is awful.",2023-07-24 02:55:21
"Based off the trailer the focus was a lot more on the bomb and Oppie, where as the movie is more focused on the politics of the time, which i understand is an important part of his story, but going into this movie I have no real understanding of the politics, and ended up being confused... and then his security being revoked at the end

After watching the doco that came out and a few YouTube videos I feel a bit more educated about what happened in that era",2023-07-23 19:10:39
"Doesn’t have to be a documentary to be as accurate as one. A biopic can be just as accurate as a documentary, it will just be presented by actors instead of archive footage. Even some documentaries will have recreations. 

Like I said earlier, the only thing not accurate in the film is when Oppenheimer started seeing the crowd as bomb victims.",2023-07-21 23:34:47
"I guess that’s where we ultimately differ here. Whether his guilt was genuine or not - it’s impossible to know. I don’t see it as a mark on the movie that it’s portrayed as being likely genuine - and even still there are moments that suggest it isn’t actually genuine. Its portrayed as fairly nuanced - so I don’t see what would have been made more interesting by leaning hard into it not being genuine. That seems very black and white, 
and reductive. Like it would’ve reduced the dramatic impact of the whole thing if it gave some easy answer like that. Especially when by the end the film is telling you it really doesn’t matter if he felt guilt one way or another",2023-07-21 19:43:33
Jesus Christ man you were adamant,2023-07-26 22:59:48
this thread is hilarious,2023-07-27 01:03:29
">not with this man 

There are probably reasons for that. 

>but you take the victories you can get

I wish it felt like a victory, but there was no real reason to give a shit 

>the movie did give reasons to care

When?",2023-07-23 05:37:05
Yes I do. How is someone calling you a soy boy relevant to my comment. It’s not.,2023-08-06 14:21:26
Also literally every critic and most people disagree with you. Seems like you are one of the few who are mad about this so called trash,2023-07-25 01:25:58
