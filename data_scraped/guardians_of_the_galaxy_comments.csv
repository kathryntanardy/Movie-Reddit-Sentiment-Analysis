More I think about it, High Evolutionary is by far one of the best MCU villains.
  

  
No jokes, No quips dude is unrelenting and fucking detestable. ""There is no god, that's why I stepped up!"", was hard as hell ngl.
  

  
Chukwudi Iwuji knocked it out of the park!",2023-05-05
"This might be one of the most uplifting endings to a Marvel movie so far, every main character got a lovely send-off! I was amazed by how Gamora was handled as well, and I admired that they didn‚Äôt rekindle Quill and Gamora‚Äôs relationship. Ultimately the film was about found family, and it never veered off course.

I didn‚Äôt expect much coming into the theatre, didn‚Äôt even watch any trailers, but ended up with so many happy tears! I think I won‚Äôt be watching movie trailers from now on‚Ä¶

Fully expected Drax to die but I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised that my expectations were subverted and that his ending was not tragic at all!

Also first MCU f-bomb I think lol",2023-05-05

What I really liked about this movie was the stakes were small. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwe gotta save the world‚Äù or ‚Äúthe fate of universe is up to us‚Äù it was just ‚Äúwe gotta save our friend‚Äù.,2023-05-05
"Personally I loved that, after an entire marketing campaign teasing it, none of the Guardians died. So many stories have heroes dying as the ‚Äúultimate heroic act‚Äù to save a future they‚Äôll never see, but Gunn flipped that trope on its head by having all the heroes live to be the ones to build that future, which is actually the most heroic act. 

The DCU is gonna rock and I hope Marvel learned as many lessons as they could from Gunn‚Äôs time with them.",2023-05-05
Why did that girl have to get her face all fucked up from that monkey? Lol that was hilarious,2023-05-05
"The most emotional entry of the trilogy and a fitting send-off to this group of Guardians!


- Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the MVP. His performance in the flashback is amazing!
- James Gunn again with his great direction. The one-take hallway scene was great
- Chukwudi Iwuji gives a great performance. First MCU villain in a while that was terrifying 
- Adam Warlock and Ayesha storyline seem underdeveloped and pacing was a little slow in the beginning
- First F-bomb in the MCU movies and it was totally unexpected!
- Appreciate that the villain was defeated easily and the main mission was saving people and animals
- Bittersweet ending but everyone survived is the best case scenario
- Dog Days Are Over is the perfect song choice to start the 2000s playlist


MCU's best movie in years and James Gunn ends with a home run!",2023-05-05

Rocket‚Ä¶.imagine minding your own business having a mini flash back listening to creep then within a moment you‚Äôre knocked through several  buildings . DIE. Go to what is purgatory and basically feel peace when you reunite with your childhood friends. Get told ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù. Come back .  Find out YOU ARE a raccoon. Reunite with your creator/abuser. Choose to not seek revenge. And then boom‚Ä¶become Captain of The Guardians of the Galaxy!,2023-05-05

When Will Poulter called Elizabeth Debicki ‚ÄúMother‚Äù‚Ä¶ same.,2023-05-05
"Something I haven't seen mentioned that I loved is how much the dark/body horror-ish aspects get amped up in this one, the fucked up experimented animals that worked for the High Evolutionary and invade Knowhere were legit creepy, especially the pig one that gets beheaded by Adam Warlock, the CGI for them was great as well, the cages Rocket and his friends lived in felt so grimy and dirty, the scene where Ayesha and Warlock are interrogating a ravager and Adam lasers him and they show his charred fucked up corpse was also great (and fucking hilarious)

And of course, probably the most satisfying scene in the whole movie, when Rocket shreds up the High Evolutionary's face for a solid 10 seconds, and at the end, when they tear away his mask and show just how much Rocket fucked him up

James Gunn really wants you to remember he directed Slither and that he could do it again if he so desired",2023-05-05

"The Counter Earth made a lot more sense after thinking about it. Sure they handwave the whole '80s vibe as the High Evolutionary copying Earth back then, but there's subtle hints it's doomed anyway. Hatsune Miku playing on the radio means the people on that planet can't sing or create anything not given to them, and can't evolve. They need fake music given to them and that's horrifying.",2023-05-05
"I was surprised not a single major character died in this.

Also has anyone noticed the Guardians movies have the most deaths of the MCU movies? In 1 they kill off almost all of the Nova Corps, in Vol 2 all of the Ravagers get killed by Yondu's arrow, and in this a whole planet is blown up. Not counting Infinity War since they get unsnapped.",2023-05-05
"""Open the fucking door!""

That caught me off guard.

Probably the strongest MCU offering in a long time. The action was great (that final hallway fight was top tier), the humour was solid and the emotional moments hit like a truck.

Also, shoutout to Iwuji as High Evolutionary. He brought that unhinged energy to the role and was freaking terrifying sometimes.",2023-05-05
I LOVE Gamora‚Äôs ending of even tho she‚Äôs not the same one they didn‚Äôt make her switch to be a guardian . She truly made her own path and found her own family in the Ravegers . The scene of her being welcomed back and hugged was a nice touch,2023-05-05
"I definitely didn't expect to cry three times while watching a movie where none of the main characters die. How James Gunn accomplished this, I don't know, but it takes real talent to be able to pull it off.

Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite MCU movie because the setting is very unique and fun. The second movie was a disappointment to me, but this one is on par with the first, if not better. The action is great, the characters are perfect, the plot has a payoff for everything, and it is very emotional.

There's something that bothered me throughout the entire movie though. What happened to Quill's mask and jet boots? Dude almost died frozen in space for no good reason.

I'm definitely going to miss this old formation of the Guardians, but at least it ended on a high note and I will forever cherish those movies.",2023-05-05

"The story is about self-hatred. Mostly. Mantis says this explicitly when she yells that Drax is the only character that *doesn't* hate himself, and that Nebula puts down others to make herself feel better. These remarks don't just apply to this set of characters, they shadow the entire series.

The High Evolutionary kills his creations because they mirror his own flaws, and this constant self-flagellation causes him to hate Rocket most of all because he is possibly the only creation that might have surpassed his creator. And he does so while being a small one off experiment rather than any of the intended breakthroughs. The High Evolutionary seems to hate himself even more for that fact, and all of his screaming and violence towards Rocket might as well be directed at himself for envying a cybernetic raccoon so much.

Rocket clearly hates himself for basically every reason anyone ever could, with denying his existence as a raccoon being the most apparent reason. He's always shoved others away out of fear of losing them, and more importantly for fear of *failing* them. He considers himself a hideous little freak, good only for killing and mocking the flaws of others. This has sadly made him resemble the High Evolutionary to a small extent, but unlike his creator Rocket finds people that love and accept him despite everything. But what changes him into a true hero is meeting the other raccoon subjects, as this allows Rocket to finally see himself as someone worthy of love and protection, thus ending his need to see the flaws in others. After all of this Rocket begins to love himself and becomes the leader he always could have been, while happily calling himself a raccoon.

After learning her other self's fate Gamora probably *can't* become the character we once knew, and Quill essentially demanding that she do so only makes her deliberately veer further away from that image. Quill has always regretted abandoning his mother and indulging in the image of the Legendary Star Lord has been his main method of coping. Making the Guardians has helped him grow some, but that core shame of running away from his earth family still drives him, he just uses the more benevolent Guardians instead of exclusively his own image to stay distracted. His continued pining for Gamora reflects that he depends on the Guardians to continue avoiding his grief, both for his original Gamora and for his mother. In the end he lets go of the new Gamora and leaves the Guardians to finally reunite with his grandfather, facing his original flaws at last.

Gamora and Nebula have been forced to define themselves by violence since they were children, with Thanos' abuse turning them against each other until they turned on him and forgave each other. While they've begun growing past their traumas, their reliances on physical competence for self-worth still forces both to hurt others. Gamora lashes out at everyone but is always painfully aware that doing so leaves her more alone. Quill's comparing her to his Gamora only further drives home her isolation, and oddly recreates the competition between her and Nebula, just with her and her future self. She seems to decide that if she is alone unlike her other self, then she needs to be more violent, forceful, and competent to make up for that. But after seeing the love between the Guardians so many times she eventually begins to see why the other Gamora was happy that way. As she lets herself see the good in the current Guardians, she finally sees the potential good in herself and begins to reach out to others in her own path.

Mantis defending Drax and herself is the ultimate counter to self-hatred. Nebula defining herself by violence and physical competence causes her to lash out at the other two for their apparent lack of these values, and she seems perplexed when Mantis screams that nobody should *need* these values. Mantis was forced to define herself by her usefulness to Ego and leaving him has not freed her from the need to have ""use"" to others. Despite that, her bond with Drax has strangely been helpful in ways that the others could never provide; his bluntness means that he freely declares both her lack of physical worth and her inherent value despite that. As a result, she isn't as bound to her old flaw as the other characters and Nebula's outburst causes Mantis to stick up for herself and Drax in much the same way that he has. Doing so causes Nebula to see the true value that they have, with Mantis calming the aliens to avoid an unwinnable fight and Drax getting the children way from danger by entertaining them. Nebula now considers everyone, herself included, as having inherent worth to the point of admirably declaring that Drax is meant to be a dad rather than a destroyer.

Anyway, I liked the movie a lot! It's got flaws, like I wish that Rocket was more active in the plot, and that he could have beaten the High Evolutionary in a more character driven way, but the ending scene of all the Guardians happy and loving themselves and each other was just beautiful.",2023-05-05

Poor Rocket‚Äôs backstory being worse than we could have imagined. Even Nebula saying it was worse than what Thanos did to her. Discovering that he really IS a raccoon. 

Cosmo is a Good Dog damnit. I liked that she wasn‚Äôt just a standard character in a dog body. She was still a dog at her core.

Rocket's backstory is one of the saddest/captivating in the entire MCU.
 There are multiple times in the movie, when I can not wait for the story to shift back to Young Rocket.

Adam Warlock felt slightly forced, but if his opening scene is an indicator of things to come, I am really excited for his character.

The High Evolutionary ( not sure if the movie ever officially calls him this) is the sort of Villan I had hoped Kang would be. More Chukwudi, please.

Those Ghost Gang Suits were amazing.

The entire sequence at the Orgosphere was fun. The MCU needs more of that. I felt the stakes were balanced, really well with the humor  throughout their time there.
The two times I laughed out loud in the movie were:
Gamora shooting the woman in the leg, and Gamora almost killing Carrot-Man.ü§£

Gamora and Quill did not need to end up together, and I was happy this movie didn't force it.

Rocket is the heart of the film, no doubt, but what this story does with Drax, Mantis, and Nebula is phenomenal. All of the arcs end in some cool places. 


In my opinion, this movie lands the plane pretty well and serves as a really good end to a really great trilogy.

"This was phenomenal I loved it. Don‚Äôt really have any critiques, I feel this may be one of the best marvel movies if not THE best. Time will tell. Loved the Kevin bacon article on the newspaper in the post credits scene.

Only critique is that I wish we got a little more Adam warlock. But I understand he‚Äôs saved for later. Also who was the little girl at the end during the mid credits Scene? Like what‚Äôs her comic book character? Where do we think the series is going next or is it completely done ? Only star lord returning is an interesting idea",2023-05-05
"I‚Äôm slightly kicking myself over this. 

My cat died after a very long battle with cancer a couple months ago and If I had known about all the animal scenes, I would not have seen it. But then I wouldn‚Äôt have seen this film, and I‚Äôd probably regret that too.

Sooo, yes, that was a tragic backstory and honestly, fuck whatever that villains name was. 


On another note, I really enjoyed the fact that the tune they were listening to in the animal house was based on Chopin, and the tune played immediately afterwards, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always chasing rainbows‚Äù is also based on Chopin. Interesting way to show they‚Äôre similar, but not quite the same.",2023-05-05
"I love that the Villain didn't have a ""good intentions but bad methods"" and that he wasn't relatable.  I am fine with that in other films, it just seems like the MCU hasn't been willing to do an irredeemable bad guy very often.

"Every Floor, Lylla, and Teefs scene had me in tears. Also Rockets first ever word being ‚ÄúHurt‚Äù is so heartbreaking.",2023-05-05
"- first movie had the best overall soundtrack, but this movie had some amazing song choices. 

- Rocket is the MVP of this trilogy, hands down. Him putting on his Guardian uniform in the third act was applause worthy. 

- those flashback sequences were so unsettling, especially the last one with the deaths of lylla and the others. Rockets escape, despite knowing he does make it away, was terrifying. 

- I‚Äôm so glad they didn‚Äôt have Gamora fall in love with quill again, instead just leaving their relationship at Gamora saying ‚ÄúI bet we were fun.‚Äù

- quill reuniting with his grandfather‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs where I full on bawled. 

- Chukwudi Iwuji‚Ä¶‚Ä¶damn he‚Äôs a good actor. I loved him in Peacemaker and now this. But FUCK The High Evolutionary. I truly didn‚Äôt think he could be worse than Ego, the guy who literally put a tumor in someone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but yep he was WAY WORSE. He makes Ego look like a Disney Channel villain. What a capital M Monster. 

- Nebula went from an underused character in the first movie, to being yet again underused but slightly more developed in V2, to gaining a bit more development in IW and Endgame‚Ä¶and this is where I finally fell in love with her. Such a great character and her rapport with the whole team was great. And her breaking down when she heard Rockets voice‚Ä¶.damn that was so sweet.",2023-05-05

"Ladies and gentlemen, if James Gunn can bring even half the heart and love of this to Superman, we are in for a fucking treat. 

Some other thoughts:

* The High Evolutionary is straight up one of the most vile villains to ever grace the MCU. Yes, Thanos killed half the universe and Red Skull was a fucking Nazi, but the unethical torturous horror of the Evolutionary's experimentation and the implications of his many implied genocides makes him individually more horrible. Thanos, by his own admission, was random and dispassionate. The H-E is petty, personal, and petulant. The only (arguably) MCU character who I loath more is Killgrave from Jessica Jones. 

* I am shocked that Gunn didn't kill any of the major characters. I thought for sure that Drax or Rocket was going to buy it. For a second I thought that Nebula was going to buy it. 

* Also, good on Gunn for not contriving to have Gamora back with Peter.

* Cosmo is good dog. 

* Missed opportunity not to have Howard the Duck as a member of the new Guardians team, TBH.

* ""The Legendary Star-Lord will return."" Solo film? Solo TV series? I want answers, Marvel!

* I would like to note that we see the High Evolutionary try to create a Ninja Turtle and fail miserably.

* Wait, was that Phyla-freaking-Vell at the end?",2023-05-05
"James Gunn‚Äôs writing is what the MCU has been missing. This was phenomenal. It reminded me why I cared in the first place. The ending was sooo good and CATHARTIC. 

* Seeing Rocket dance and become the leader of the team! üò≠ 
* Drax finding a way to be a Dad again. AND DANCING. üò≠üò≠
* Understanding Groot for the first time because WE ARE (as the audience) THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. üò≠üò≠üò≠
* Seeing Nebula become someone devoted to caring for others. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

The emotion was absolutely unreal throughout the film especially at the end. When Florence hit I was just dead. That feeling, that emotional, that‚Äôs why I fucking care. 

I‚Äôm going to miss these characters and stories. I don‚Äôt know if the MCU will have emotional payoff like this again. This was an Endgame moment for me. Yes, I know ‚Äúthe legendary Star-Lord will return‚Äù but without Gunn will it be the same? 

Beautiful movie. And a special trilogy in my heart. Probably my favorite credit scene ever too. Rocket music theory class when. 

Guardians > All of MCU combined. I said what I said.",2023-05-05
I was destroyed when Lila the Otter died but then I remembered she gets reincarnated as Hawkeye‚Äôs wife so it was all good,2023-05-05
"I don't like it when Marvel cuts emotional scenes with a joke. But the limbo scene with Lyla and Rocket, and Lyla calls Rocket a raccoon and Rocket responds with ""I'm not a raccoon-"" before being brought back to life absolutely killed me. It was such an in-character move because Rocket has been shown to constantly tell people that he isn't a raccoon. 

And it was the perfect way of transitioning from an emotional tone to a ""alright, I'm back, let's get down to fucking business"" tone for the final act. Beautiful.",2023-05-06
Marvel just lost its best director,2023-05-05
"Probably the biggest takeaway for most of the audience was that none of the original Guardian members died and officially that Star Lord will return, if not more, as we saw in the first post credits scene. 

My favorite takeaway that the audience will probably not realize is, when Groot says his first new dialogue, ‚ÄúI love you guys‚Äù he is still saying ‚ÄúI am Groot.‚Äù We as the audience (those that have heard the line through multiple films) have heard the line long enough to finally understand Groot. 

Clever writing by James Gunn if that was intended because in the first act of the film new Gamora frustratingly asks why Groot only says ‚ÄúI am Groot.‚Äù It was not until the last act of the film Gamora said she finally understood what Groot was saying because she heard him say that same line long enough.",2023-05-05

"Odd pull, I know, but did anyone else get Frank-N-Furter vibes from the high evolutionary? Yeah, they have shared inspiration in Frankenstein, but there‚Äôs some specific beats- golden himbo creation, the crew believe he‚Äôs gone too far and mutiny- as well as a shared 70s aesthetic that made me think Frank specifically. 

On a related note, there‚Äôs a bit where Adam Warlock calls the high evolutionary a name and it gets censored by an energy blast. Now, my hearing may not be the best, and as I saw it at a screening it‚Äôs been a week or so since I saw it, but did he go ‚Äúyou pompous fa-‚Äú before getting cut off? If so, *wild* line for a MCU movie lmao",2023-05-05

Recently I've said goodbye to my closest friends as they've moved away and moved on to other things, it was oddly cathartic to see it happen to them as well. It all felt very human. 

James Gunn, go crush it at DC.",2023-05-05
Now open the **FUCKING** door,2023-05-05
"One of my favourite parts of this movie, is just how insanely formidable the Guardians have become when they are all together. They‚Äôre each pretty deadly 1v1ing someone, but this film really showed how in sync they are when it comes to fighting. Quill and Groot destroyed that room when they were with the HE. 
The hallway scene will go down as one of the best action scenes in MCU history. 
That final showdown with HE where they just demolished him, after a whole movie of building him up to be considered on par with a god. 
The Guardians were a forced to be reckoned with this whole film, and I want more.",2023-05-05

Solid fucking movie. My only complaint is that Quill just mysteriously stopped using his mask in-between movies. Which lead to a kind of underwhelming death fakeout at the end.,2023-05-05
"I don‚Äôt normally write serious reviews and i was very tempted just to say ‚Äúhow is Vin Diesel‚Äôs best role just him playing a talking tree‚Äù but this film made me cry twice so here we go.

This film shifted its tone about 30 thousand times and it didn‚Äôt lose me once, it had the best chemistry i‚Äôve probably ever seen in a marvel film. We all know Guardians is one of MCU‚Äôs best projects but my god every character in this has a unique backstory, unique motivation, unique relationships and we know them all inside out and we understand everything they are feeling.

Even the new characters feel so well established which is also down to the incredible performances by Will Poulter and Chukwudi Iwuji. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me think that there is still hope for Marvel. It is on par with Infinity War which only slightly edges it on my all time MCU rankings. 

So go watch it in the biggest, loudest theatre you can find and make sure you are ready to cry.",2023-05-05
"From beginning to end, I feel like this movie *rewarded* you for being a MCU fan, because of the emotional payoffs to each Guardian's character arc and journey since the first GOTG movie, not forgetting their involvement in the non-Guardians movies. Notably and imo most understatedly, are the characters of Drax and Mantis.

We see Drax coming full circle from seeking vengeance against those who killed his daughter, taking on the moniker of 'the Destroyer', to having a second stab (heh) at being a dad. Having been the comic relief for GOTG2 and parts of this movie as well, ""You were born to be a father"" is a clear reminder of the trauma this character has faced, and also the new surrogate role that he will take on post GOTG3. 

For Drax's usual comic sidekick Mantis, it is as though Gunn speaks directly through Klementieff when she says 'I served what Ego wanted, and then I served what the Guardians wanted, and now it is time for me to figure out what I want'. It's easy to forget that she never had any agency, and the amicable parting of ways is the first truly independent decision that she has made for herself. 

Sorry for any misquotes!",2023-05-06
"This series stands out to me as one of the most consistent film series that doesn't get stale. Every character's arc ended perfectly for me. James Gunn knows how to make entertaining action and drama scenes. The soundtrack throughout the trilogy has been the best ever heard of in film. And a lot of the visuals looked great.

Thought Warlock was underutilized, or my expectations were too high. I guess they need to build him up for future films. Chukwudi Iwuji was killer and definitely top-tier in any comic villain on screen. Every other actor was stellar, James knows how to pick his people.

What a perfect way to end this group of characters. It's been a great journey. Bravo James Gunn!",2023-05-05
"So they kinda retconned Lylla didn't they? In the first movie she was listed as a known associate of Rocket's, implying she was a free being who likely participated in some dubious activities. But in Vol 3 she never made it out of the lab.",2023-05-05

"Wow. I don‚Äôt know what I really expected from this movie, but James Gunn made a perfect ending to the Guardians story. I laughed a lot, and I cried a lot. And by god it had the best use of ‚Äúfuck‚Äù I have ever heard in a movie before.

The GotG movies mean a lot to me (hell just look at my username); in a lot of ways I feel like I have grown up and matured just as the characters in the movies did. While it‚Äôs sad to see the Guardians as I knew and loved them end, sometimes that‚Äôs life. And it‚Äôs the end of one thing, but the start of something new for them, and that‚Äôs exactly where I am right now too. But that‚Äôs life, and you never forget who you used to be or who you used to be with. 

 I couldn‚Äôt be happier with GotG 3 and how it wrapped up everyone‚Äôs stories. The Guardians trilogy has always been special for me and I‚Äôve had a deeper connection to them and their story. I‚Äôm sad to see it go, but I‚Äôm happy with where things ended.

The MCU as a whole is going to feel so empty now without the GotG or Gunn in them. They both in a way were the heart of the MCU and I feel like a lot of that is going to be gone now. We‚Äôve already felt and seen a drastic quality difference in these post Endgame films, and with Gunn and the Guardians gone, I fear the soul of the MCU leaves with it. Me personally, this is where I throw in the towel; the Guardians were the last characters who‚Äôs stories I still cared about post Endgame, so now that their story ends, I really have no attachment to the MCU anymore.",2023-05-05
"Very surprising that James Gunn didn‚Äôt kill anyone off in this movie, yes there‚Äôs a fragile closure that‚Äôs been given to everyone‚Äôs arc but there‚Äôs really nothing stopping a different director from coming in and disturbing the peace in the future. Maybe the MCU has more respect for Gunn then that, maybe the actors won‚Äôt go for it, but money talks and it gets real persuasive when it does.",2023-05-05

‚ÄúI love you guys,‚Äù had my audience gasping and even had a few screaming ‚ÄúWhat?! He talks now?‚Äù collectively.

This movie was more brutal that I expected. Rocket‚Äôs past was rough to sit through. 

The High Evolutionary‚Äôs true face was scary as shit! I expected he‚Äôd look messed up, I just didn‚Äôt expect them to show it, for one, and for two, I didn‚Äôt expect it to look as bloody as it was. Really nice!

This felt like a step in a more mature direction for Marvel, I really do hope that continues. After the last few films being a bit of a misfire/miss step, in my opinion, this was a nice breath of fresh air.

Anyone else just completely love both the character and villain designs? Some of them reminded me of Doom/Duke Nukem. I thought they all looked pretty solid, even non-villain characters like the people on Counter-Earth, you could tell there was lots of thought put into their designs.

I cannot wait to watch this again.",2023-05-05

"It's just a few seconds, but I think my new favorite MCU moment is when Nebula cries after hearing Rocket's voice for the first time after he comes to.

We have this character who, since day one, has been a programmed killing machine and nothing more for the most part. Sure, we have her team up scenes with others, some sisterly connection with Gamora, those brief moments with Tony on the ship and Rocket on the ground in Endgame, but mostly it's all about her and her objective and how she can get from Point A to Point B, with or without those near her.

In Volume 3, she has those moments of intensity with Mantis and Drax, she seems just done with Quill's bullshit, and she just wants to help her friend, but it's not until she hears Rocket's voice for that first time that we see that crack in that tough facade. She shows an emotional response of love, and Gunn makes sure we see it. It's beautiful, even if she didn't mean to display that emotion. Perfect moment for a wonderful character.",2023-05-06

It's established just a bit before that Gamora now understands Groot. But it's not like she learned his language all of a sudden, but instead that she has spent enough time with him and gotten to know him that she UNDERSTANDS him now. She grocks Groot. So when we hear Groot say ""I love you guys."" at the end, he's still saying ""I am Groot."" it's just that we the audience have spent enough time with Groot that we too finally understand him. Such a beautiful way for James Gunn to express his love and gratitude for all us fans!",2023-05-05

Us hearing that was a beautiful way to basically include the audience as part of the family, showing us that we've spent enough time with him to understand him. Beautiful.",2023-05-12
"So that‚Äôs what happens when a movie director genuinely loves the characters he gave life to on the screen.

The Guardians are the ones that got me into the MCU. Volume 2 was my very first IMAX experience. Volume 3 my first Hollywood premiere experience. I watched the movie again today in my hometown. I was an emotional wreck at the end. Hit me right in the feels.

I never knew a raccoon would make me cry over and over again. But the entire Rocket storyline is the most beautiful and tragic ones on the MCU. 

It also hit me on a very personal level as I had a post-death experience after a heart attack twelve years ago and what Rocket experienced‚Ä¶ well, that reminded me twelve years ago. When I rewatched ‚Äúthat‚Äù scene, I just lost it.

On top of that, I know the soundtrack is amazing, but the score itself is absolutely phenomenal. Especially the score revolving around Rocket and the High Evolutionary.

Needless to say, this became my favorite MCU movie ever. And I know it will remain my favorite MCU movie ever.

Nobody talking about how we just saw a literal mirror planet of Earth explode on-screen in an MCU movie? As a real consequence to the story instead of some flashback or off-screen like Xandar?

"Let's also acknowledge that one of the reasons Guardians V3 works so well is because it's really not an MCU movie, it's a *Guardians* movie. It has zero connective tissue or threads to other storylines, plots or characters. Gunn was allowed to focus on the closing chapter of his trilogy and didn't have to worry about servicing a bigger overarching plot. Marvel needs more of this to right the ship. Give us good movies about contained character stories.  *Then* do crossover movies.",2023-05-06

"I had really high expectations for this movie, not only because of how much I enjoyed the previous two Guardians movies but also due to how good The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker were. And somehow, not only were those expectations met but in a lot of ways they were surprassed. The acting from everyone was amazing, the visuals were on point and the action was brutal and really showcases how a PG-13 rating doesn't matter when the people behind the movies are creative. The plot on the other hand was exactly what I hoped for, completely focused on the characters we've come to love and lengthy enough to showcase everyone and give every single guardian a satisfying ending. Speaking of expectations, I (along with I assume many others) came into the movie expecting at least one Guardian to pass away, and yet despite loving a good emotional character death I was very happy to see that not a single one died and I didn't feel cheated. I think it's a lot harder to not rely on death as a way to close out a character story compared to what the movie did. 

The High Evolutionary however was what surprised me the most, in a really positive way. James Gunn had talked up Chukwudi Iwuji a lot during the wait for the movie, and yet I was still shocked at how good he was at playing such a brutal and cruel villain. Every time he showed up, I not only wanted him gone but feared what he might do. For a franchise like Marvel to not normally have the best villains, he's a huge breath of fresh air. 

As you can probably guess, I really recommend this movie. It doesn't feel rushed and the jokes range from alright to hilarious, and never undercut the emotional beats the movie is going for. It's by far the best movie Marvel has put out since Infinity War, and really shows the difference between a movie made by someone who loves what he's doing vs someone who was paid to do so. I don't want even want to think how this movie would have turned out without James Gunn, but at the same time I can't wait to see what he does at DC. If this movie is any indication, Superman Legacy is going to be amazing.",2023-05-05

"Man, they genuinely took a risk with this one. This might turn off some general audiences that just wanted to see the guardians say some funny zingers

Everyone who was invested in Guardians as an exploration of what it means to move past trauma will love it, though.

Every bold choice Marvel's made recently felt like it had someone there to rein it back into vanilla MCU territory, whether it's the Raimi weirdness in Dr Strange 2 supporting a fairly typical superhero movie origin for America or whatever her name was, or Ms Marvel's Scott Pilgrim-esque style disappearing after only a couple episodes

James Gunn is gone now, a lot of this cast is never coming back, so that's it for the guardians as we know them. And marvel has had such a bad track record these last few years that I just have little hope that we are going to get anything this good for a long time.

I think we‚Äôll see him again, and hope they top it for when he finally dies. 

It does bode a bit ill for the MCU‚Äôs grand plan that two movies into Phase Five, Kang is already only the second best purple-wearing tech based villain with a connection to one of the heroes‚Äô pasts that we‚Äôve seen.  At this point, have the end credits scene of The Marvels be Kamala accidentally knocking a nuke into an interdimensional portal, where it kills the entire stupid council without anyone knowing or acknowledging it.",2023-05-05

One passion project after another. For this film especially, being the trilogy finale I feel that Gunn ended it as a love letter to all of the GOTG fan base. 2 hours of messing with my ethos and pathos. Didn‚Äôt expect to be emotionally connected to a animated Raccoon‚Äôs journey but sure enough I was. All characters given their rightful send-offs and ending the film with some Florence in a GOTG-fashioned dance party. Fucking brilliant.

One thing I like about James Gunn is that he's able to make you care about characters who don't really exist. Like a talking raccoon isn't a real thing, but we still feel for Rocket. Learning about his past was heartbreaking. 

And someone brought this up but when Rocket says 'that's no excuse to get everyone dead along the way', it was probably in reference>! to Teefs and Floor dying. He probably blamed himself because he attacked the High Evolutionary instead of just escaping.!<

It sucks that this is the final GOTG film but you know what? It ended on the perfect note. Everything was wrapped up perfectly and it was nice to see these characters grow throughout the three movies.",2023-05-08
"There's so much to love about this movie as far as the lovable protagonists and their interactions go, but I really want to highlight the villain. High Evolutionary was a top 5 MCU baddie for me, right up there with Thanos, Loki, and Kilmonger.

We were all happy to see him >!get his face peeled off !<in the end.",2023-05-08
"When Gunn Captioned the movie ""Once more with FEELING"" he massively overdid it.

They just cut to scene and bolted on some cliche cathartic stuff. But catharsis is also as good as the tension it releases and I don‚Äôt think this movie did a good enough job. Also I didn‚Äôt like the quick cuts between gross and horrific scenes and funny ones. It was hard to appreciate the one liners while still really from the body-horror in the previous scene.

I‚Äôd have liked to see more Adam Warlock.

This movie could‚Äôve used an RRR-style card up front warning people about the shit they were about to see.

Other than that, this was an immensely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. I don‚Äôt think viewers need to see the new guardians in action to know that Rocket found his closure and that everyone is where they ought to be.",2023-05-08

It may if been a end credits scene but Rocket really proved himself as a great leader in that short screen time . He starts off with a group activity of asking everyone‚Äôs fav music artist ? One member offers to get the job done on their own and he says it‚Äôll be easier and better to do it as a team. When the youngest member ask member ask if he ever feels bad for hurting creatures he acknowledges that he does but that the people they protect need this help and it‚Äôs for the  greater good.,2023-05-09
"I swear there's an onion cutting lounge next to this theatre. I'm rewatching it like the 4th time & I still can't hold it in whenever we flashback to teen rocket 


FR. Though, despite lacking a major Character death like Yondu, This movie elicited more emotions than any other MCU movie.I haven't stopped feeling bad ever since I first watched this Film. Damnit Gunn, You really went out of your way to make this film the most heartfelt ending I've ever experienced",2023-05-09
"I really enjoyed this, I didn't love all of the needle drops though there are definitely some banger moments that James Gunn enhanced with music.

Hallway ""one-take"" fight is great, but how many ""Line up the guardians of the galaxy for a hero shot"" moments do we need? there's like 3 in every one of these movies.

I love the little treat with Groot at the end there, when we can finally understand him. A trait that only occurs in other Guardians up to that point (iirc).

No deaths was a big surprise for me, I expected Drax or Rocket. I'm glad, I like getting closure with everyone and it not being a horrible drama.

Peter going home makes sense. It's what we've been asking this whole time. ""Why, since he's been adventuring, has he not gone home?"". We all know the short answer is that Peter is afraid, but I feel that he'd probably be past that fear by now after all of his experiences. I'm glad we got some form of conclusion.

What a weird tension between Rocket and Peter at the very end when they're freeing the animals. Quill is surprised and annoyed that Rocket, an animal, wants to rescue animals.

7 or 8/10? great capper to the GotG trilogy.",2023-05-09
"I don‚Äôt think I enjoyed this one as much as people are out there, largely because of the messiness, but it‚Äôs still an emotionally satisfying conclusion to this team. I just wish that Marvel will trust their filmmakers more like they did for James Gunn. Yes, he contributed to the excessive storylines and characters in this film, but at least this film felt like a singular vision, which was lacking in recent MCU properties",2023-05-10
"Just watched the film, happy to see a decent, entertaining MCU movie after No Way Home. Higher Evolutionary is a villain you cannot sympathize with, that fucker deserved to die. And when you hate the character, that actor really portrayed it very well.

Loved the character arcs for all the characters, for some reason loved how the team never gave up on Rocket who has been my favorite since Guardians 1. Had its comic moments, and I almost tear dropped at Rocket's backstory but thankfully the shift in tonal balance by the in-between humour helped to control my emotions. That's what is needed : a balance of humour and tonal shifts.

Only complain I have is Warlock , Warlock could have been used better but apart from that, loved the movie. Favorite segment of the movie has to be the counter earth one, filled with lot of intense moments.",2023-05-12

"Loved it tbh, absolutely fitting end to Gunn's trilogy. So happy he didn't have Gamora just fall in love with Quill at the end and for Quill to realise that they were different people. Teared up at the end and a couple times throughout. IMO definitely has been Marvels best additions to the cinematic library.",2023-05-05

"With Multiverse of Madness being very middling as a Dr. Strange movie and a follow-up to WandaVision, Love and Thunder being unbearably unfunny every time the villain wasn't on screen, and Quantumania feeling like it lacked guidance in everything from the visuals to the writing, it was nice seeing a consistently good MCU movie. James Gunn was able to make a compelling conclusion to a series of movies that could have easily focused too much on the spectacle or the comedy.

The biggest problem I would say was that the movie would ping-pong way too quickly between a shockingly dark tone and the broad humor expected from the series. The darker scenes worked surprisingly well, better than the funnier scenes even, but it would go right back to trying to be funny almost immediately. When those scenes involved CG characters, I was getting flashbacks to Dobby's death scene in Half-Blood Prince, and how impossible it was to take seriously. Rocket's backstory was definitely written well, but I think it would have worked better as a 10-15 minute interlude rather than being cut up like it was.

The post-Endgame MCU as a whole is definitely still shaky at best, but taking the trilogy on its own, it felt a bit jarring to shift the focal point to the talking raccoon but it was pulled off pretty well. Good performances, great visuals, and solid writing, so I'd really recommend it if you've seen and liked the first two.",2023-05-07
"The one take towards the end was one of the most impressively choreographed cinematic things I've seen in years. Didn't expect to see something that impressive in *this* film of all places. I've been bemoaning the lack of good action choreography for what seems like forever and this just comes out with one of the most impressive sequences in a long-ass time.

"I think one thing its not getting enough credit for is how for the first time in a long time its a MCU with a solid act 3. MoM, Shang Chi, and eternals all really missed the mark in the ending.

But this worked, and its nice to see the highlight being the superheros saving people over big CGI punch ups; especially when the final fight wasnt the evolutionary being ""cool"" but rather just getting absolutley shanked.",2023-05-07
I walked in to this movie blind and now I might turn vegan,2023-05-07
"What are your thoughts on the soundtrack? 

I personally believe that Vol. 2 still has the best soundtrack in the trilogy with Vol. 1 being a close second. 

I enjoyed this soundtrack, maybe not as much as the previous ones but it fits really well in the movie giving the fact that they're playing music from a Zune, it is only natural for there to be genre mixing. I saw someone complain that the music in this movie isn't consistent as the first two; yes, because the first two are mix tapes and this is just someones mp3 library, its the way it is for a reason! 

I was really happy that they included some some of my personal fav songs, I love Creep, Badlands and Do You Realise??, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is one of my fav albums, so I'm glad that the Flaming Lips got some love. Since You Been Gone and In the Meantime are two songs I've never heard before that are just amazing. 

However there were some songs I still kinda feel iffy about, them being No Sleep Till Brooklyn and Dog Days Are Over. I like the Beastie Boys but it felt kinda out of place and overdone. Dog Days Are Over, I gotta say TikTok ruined it for me and it will forever be known as a TikTok song to my ears. TikTok aside, I'm not the biggest fan of the song, and I feel that it didn't work that well and that there could've been so many better alternatives. That's just me though.",2023-05-08
"Did anyone else laugh out loud at the jokes throughout the movie? I found pretty much anything Drax said to be funny ( from now anything  Dave Bautista is in im seeing).

"Overall I really liked it. 

Things I liked:

*Mantis probably stole the show. ‚ÄúForget‚Äù was my hardest laugh of the film. 

*Rocket‚Äôs backstory was well done. 

*The alien designs were awesome. The portal (sorcerer?) in the Ravagers was especially cool-looking. 

*The ‚Äúbad dog‚Äù running gag was fun. 

*The hallway fight is top tier. One of the best fight sequences in the MCU (IMO).

*Villain was solid. Not amazing, but definitely my favourite of the Guardians‚Äô enemies.

*Overall pacing felt good.

Things I disliked: 

*Soundtrack felt weaker this time around. 

*Could have used a bit tighter editing. We didn‚Äôt really need that many slow motion walks, for instance.

*Rocket should have gotten a bit more to do before and after he got injured. I know this was his story, but it didn‚Äôt quite feel like it entirely. 

*The children scene with Drax was pretty corny. 

*I know that infighting is the group‚Äôs shtick, but doubting each other‚Äôs capabilities at this point is pretty dumb. 

*Assuming there‚Äôs a 4th one coming with a new, Rocket-lead group, I would have liked Mantis and Nebula to have stuck around for it. Feels disappointing that we only got them as official Guardians for one Volume. 

Overall it felt like a good sendoff. If they continue from here with Rocket‚Äôs Guardians, then I am on board. If they stop it entirely, then this was a solid finale to the story.",2023-05-27
"I fucking tried at a computer-generated raccoon holding a dying, computer-generated cyborg otter in his arms. And then again when she returned to tell him that it's all right and it's not his time to die yet. *Bastards*.

This was... a triumph. I'm not as negative about Love & Thunder or Quantumania as many other folks are, but what James Gunn accomplished here still dwarfs those films. It closes the book on this ragtag family of misfits with some of the franchise's hardest-hitting emotional beats, without losing its own identity or getting mired too deep into misery. If Gunn can handle Superman with half as much grace and skill as we saw here, the future's gonna be so bright we'll all be wearing shades.",2023-05-05
"Reminder that Elon Musk's Neuralink has killed 1,500+ animals including pigs, sheep, and monkeys in the process of trying to put computer chips in their brains. Something to think about for everyone who was understandably disgusted by the High Evolutionary.",2023-05-11
"I really wanted to love this movie as much as the other two, but I thought this was the weakest of the trilogy. It was still great, don‚Äôt get me wrong!

When the emotional beats hit, they really hit. Rocket‚Äôs backstory was done perfectly. The visuals were fantastic. The characters all had great arcs and satisfying conclusions. I think the balance of humor in this was a big improvement from vol 2, which I thought had way too many emotional moments undercut by lame jokes. This one still had jokes, but they weren‚Äôt used to sacrifice the emotional moments (other than that Quill/Gamora suit conversation, but I thought that joke was worth it).

My issue with the movie is that the tone just felt off compared to the other 2 guardians movies. I think part of it was that the music sort of took a back seat for most of the movie. In the first two, the music really felt like a significant part of the story and most of the songs had notable needle drops. In this one, it felt like the majority of the music was thrown in just cause they had the zune. I‚Äôd say there were 3 good needle drops in this one (Creep, No Sleep till Brooklyn, Dog Days are Over). Seems like Gunn tried to tie the zune to Rocket more in this, but it just didn‚Äôt have the same impact for me as Quill‚Äôs tapes.

The other factor was that I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of how the team was split up in the 2nd act (Nebula/Mantis/Drax and Quill/Groot), especially with Rocket out of commission for most of the movie. I think we‚Äôve seen plenty of Drax and Mantis together in Vol 2 and the holiday special and I really wish they would‚Äôve been split up so we could see some different dynamics, like maybe have Mantis with Peter since they‚Äôre siblings. And Groot is great and all, but it doesn‚Äôt allow much conversation to be had between the characters when he‚Äôs in a duo. With Rocket being in a sort of coma for most of the movie, all we get of him are the flashbacks, which, while great, are a completely different character from the Rocket we‚Äôve grown to love over the years. With this being the conclusion to Gunn‚Äôs iteration of the team, I don‚Äôt think it was the best choice to have one of them ko‚Äôd for 80% of it. It just kinda threw off the dynamic in my opinion.",2023-05-05

"I just came from an intimate screening at the Alamo with a Q&A involving the editor and the exec producer. I was able to tell them that this movie did a perfect job of blending heart and comedy, without sacrificing the other‚Ä¶..something marvel hasn‚Äôt been able to do in a while (I didn‚Äôt tell them that part)

The exec Producer revealed a small detail that people might have missed, that drax was carrying the high Evolutionary back to the ship in the end 

Also when asked, half of my theater was mixed on how Groot spoke a new line at the end. Half of my theater guessed that groot learned how to speak English and the other half, the correct half, answered that we finally learned how to understand Groot

Another fun detail is the editor  used his two-year-old to record the line for baby rocket. Which is the second instance I‚Äôve heard of this, as another editor I know, that works on the mandolorian, used his two-year-old to voice baby Yoda. 

Which just goes to show you fellow editors, if you have a baby, cast them !",2023-05-05

"I'm not gonna lie, this movie was pretty dark. I thought it should have been rated R. Quill almost dying was messed up and when Gamora literally PEELS A FACE OFF was horrifying. This was a strange movie. I liked it and disliked it at the same time if that makes any sense.",2023-05-10
"In short, I loved it even though it's not quite as tight or tonally perfect as the previous entries. I think the Guardians have the strongest movies of any of the linear series in the Marvel universe and I think they are the best thing to come out of the franchise, so it was honestly great to see it go out on a high note. This movie may be a tad over stuffed and long, but you will never doubt Gunn's love for these characters and these character's love for each other. 

I was an absolute mess for the last thirty minutes of this movie or so. I think one thing that will take people by surprise is that it doesn't weave as seamlessly between comedy and emotion as the first two. This one is a lot more emotional, partially because a lot of these closed off characters are at a point where they are openly loving to each other and partially because this does feel like a big goodbye from Gunn. 

He's been with these characters and this cast for a decade now and you can really feel how much it means to all of them. I think the first two movies are great at the balance, but I loved this for its own reason of being unabashedly heartfelt. It seems like every character gets an arc that lets their best self shine. Drax especially got some nice shine and I thought I was holding it together pretty well until he was waving goodbye to Mantis at the end and I was devastated. 

Also very glad that this is very much Rocket's film. He always did feel like the most vulnerable and interesting character to me and despite him spending half this movie in a coma he's the key to this whole movie. He's the motivation for the villain and the guardians, he's our connection to the importance of friends with his flashbacks, and he is seemingly now the only one keeping the Guardians going in some form. I think it was kind of cheating to open this movie with a shot of his baby raccoon eyes, but what Gunn has done with that character is nothing short of amazing. 

Most of my complaints about this movie were also things I was happy to overlook for the overall effect. It definitely feels long, but that also makes it feel more final and gives some of the emotional moments time to breathe. It's not as zany or comical as the previous, but that seems to have been replaced by some really visceral body horror and I kinda loved that. And while the movie feels a bit bloated, especially with Warlock who seemed like a very predictable section of the movie, it's clearly set up for future stuff and I feel like at this point with Marvel you're either on board for that stuff or not. Plus, I will never say no to more Debicki in movies. 

Overall, I don't think it's my favorite of the three (Vol. 2 is one of my favorite Marvel movies overall) but it's a grand cap to the trilogy and is strong enough to make this one of the best trilogies out there of any franchise. Gunn has really done something amazing with these characters and it's wild to think that a decade ago Vol. 1 was Marvel's big swing. Chris actually uses his charisma in this role unlike Jurassic, Pom is literally perfect, everyone is just great and more importantly, you get the feeling they're all actually friends who love each other. As far as Marvel movies go, it's a 9/10 for me. All three are.

Now let me go and resume crying on my bed.",2023-05-07
"I felt really bad for Blurp when Adam killed his ravager owner and he sadly cuddled up to his leg, then was scared so badly by Gamora he peed all over the floor ü•∫

Felt really bad for that little guy, I'm glad he got a happy ending.

Also was excited to see Phyla actually make it into the group, and she's got good taste in late 90s music. And I don't think the Ayesha survived, which would explain for Adam in the end.",2023-05-07
Gamora saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we had fun‚Äù hit like a truck,2023-05-07
Finally a Marvel movie that felt like more than checking a box.,2023-05-07
"Loved the movie. It was good cap to the trilogy and I am glad the people that leave or will leave will do i organically and not some forced death.

The ine thing I was bummed/disappointed abotu was Adam Warlock. I feel he was both under used and missused. Like if he was going to be under used maybe his intro would be better? At least he came back. At one point I thought he was just done. I guess him being powerful and young keeps him back from dominating.

The High Evolutionary was a great villain. Amazingly done and his end was ambiguous so hopefully he returns. 

Loved it. Better than the most recent Marvel movies, but still kind of the same.",2023-05-07

"I think this was 110% a Guardians movie. James Gunn went ham with it. 

I think there were a few too many songs. There were barely any scenes without a song, and we'd hear like 30s of each one. I feel like barely any of the songs made any impact on me (compared to Vol 1 which has an amazing soundtrack).",2023-05-08
"Loved this movie. I've been really lukewarm on Marvel since Endgame. I was in the minority and thought No Way Home was all fan service, and no substance. The rest have been super middling. But this movie was pure blockbuster in the best way. It was hilarious, charming, clever, and extremely emotional. Just such a fun time at the movies.",2023-05-08
"Rocket's backstory just makes his reaction to Groot's death in the first movie hit so much harder. He must've felt enormous guilt.

Also, wtf is with all the Adam Warlock hate from critics? He seems to be well received, but everyone reviewing the fucking movie seems to think he's wasted or don't fit in. Are we even watching the same damn movie?",2023-05-08

"3 days late, and one thing I haven't seen mentioned so far is praise for Mantis's character arc.

"Watched this for the second time and it really hit the sweet spot today. I can definitely appreciate it a lot more now that my ""expectations"" are out of the way. Had a good crowd that laughed at all the right places and I ended up sobbing a lot harder this time. I feel like all the characters are at a really good place at the end of this film, but I can't help but wonder what Marvel Inc. has in store for Guardians 2.0 and Star-Lord.

The hardest goodbye for me to watch is Drax and Mantis, since they're probably my two favorite characters in the MCU. I'd give anything for a spin-off series with just those two (similar to the Holiday Special), but only if James Gunn, Dave and Pom were all involved. They're just the best. I really love this fucking movie. (Sadly, I can't say I share the same sentiment for anything else due from the MCU this year.)",2023-05-09
"Did anyone else notice that early in the film Quill listens to the song ""Do You Realize"" by The Flaming Lips, but he takes off his headphones just before the line ""Do you realize that everyone you know someday will die?""

"So, according to the movie H.E only started to populate Counter-Earth with the 'Humanimals' shortly after Rocket pointed out the flaw in the evolution process, yes? This means that the civilization on the planet couldn't have been there for more than a few generations at most and we can also presume that H.E. literally made the 1970s-esque era on display it's starting point instead of bothering to do a stone age, bronze age etc. rigmarole which obviously would have taken millennia.",2023-05-09
Man what a great but sad movie,2023-05-09
Very good movie. James Gunn is a master of manipulating the emotions of the audience. The only significant flaw has to be Adam Warlock. It's the only thing that felt like typical MCU world-building bloat. Everything was pretty focused and then you have this half-baked introduction to a new character who really has nothing to do after the first 10 minutes of the movie.,2023-05-09

"Man this movie made me so happy, finally another good Marvel movie. I might need to watch this again, but I think I really rate this up there with Ragnarok.

So happy this was not a cameo and reference fest like the recent movies. It just focused on the group. I think this had like zero references to the overall MCU plot and I enjoyed that. I legit had tears a few times. The action was great and that hallway fight scene was glorious. 

Something not getting enough love is the cinematography and camerawork. It had such a unique vibe. Did not feel like a typical Marvel movie. A lot of moving shots and interesting angles & lenses. It really shined in a lot of places and added sooo much to the hallway fight. 

On the other hand, watched the Marvels trailer before the movie, so it looks like we‚Äôre going back to shitty Marvel movies after this one. But I really hope they pick up some ideas from this one and maybe in the next batch they get their shit together.",2023-05-12
Did they imply the HIgh Evolutionary lost his face because of Rocket's scratches?,2023-05-13

Loved the Bebop and Rocksteady cameos,2023-07-08
I might be reaching on this but I could not help but to think that last scene when Drax said goodbye to mantis and then he had to suck up all the pain and act cheerful and dance for the people around him was such a dad act watching someone you love leave to find there own life and us dads having to let them go and hope for the best.,2023-08-02

"Winter Solider was amazing and Endgame was awesome, but this absolutely takes the spot of my favorite Marvel movie - maybe even CBM period. 

Funny, terrifying, badass, heart-rending and heart-warming; it‚Äôs got everything. Plus the huge focus on overcoming trauma and found families? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been pushed to tears so many times in a single movie, and it‚Äôs probably the first movie that made me cry through its ending and half the credits. Pulling out Dog Days just absolutely wrecked me. 

Truly a 10 out of 10 for me.",2023-05-09

"I'm reading nothing but 10/10 reviews and honestly I feel like I'm in the minority for thinking this movie was average. I give it like 6.5/10. Adam warlock was completely wasted, a lot of the humor didn't work for me and would undercut the dramatic moments at times. I wish they would have explored rockets background even more. I honestly felt nothing when his cell mates died. I was so excited for this movie but through the duration of it I felt bored at times. Definitely the weakest guardians movie for me. It wasn't as bad as Quantamania but I still don't understand all the love it's getting.",2023-05-05
"Cheap low effort story telling.

If the only way you can arouse emotion in a film is to hurt cute animals and have children in peril, you're a bad storyteller.

The plot? Our friend got hurt, we need mcguffin A! Oh no, that didn't work, we need mcguffin B. But were also being chased while we try to find it. Thrilling stuff.

And between this and ant man, is phase 
5 promising to be the angry black man villain with magic ""throw people around somehow"" powers, who's been there the whole time with a shadowy connection to a main character that they ""never talk about"", and who has had a key to their *ultimate power* removed from their grasp, and use the protagonists to deliver it by holding their companion(s) hostage, only to be turned on by those in their employ, and have the world they created collapse at their feet as they attempt an unsuccessful escape in a massive palatial building that just happens to actually be a ship, but is thwarted by our heroes just in time, as background character battle against faceless hordes outside for some reason?

Do Marvel have to do literally **everything** to an obnoxiously formulaic template?

Tedious pacing. It feels like James Gunn wants to be Tarantino, with mundane pop culture filled banter interespersed between heavy and brutal action. But the former just drags, because instead of being quirky and witty character insights, it's just an avenue to deliver reminders about  personal dramas from the past X films (""How's your grandfather"", ""I'm not the same person!"").

Multiple times they literally just went into conversations summarizing the plots of previous films. I get that there are an infinity of details to remember qcross all these films, but if the solution is to have characters recap hamfistedly for minutes at a time mid-film, maybe it points to greater design problems with this style of franchise?

And so much random nonsense. We have to break into a place to get mcguffin A. But it's actually *A LIVING BUILDING!* How kooky! And there's an earth where all the people are half animal!? Wackadoo! Also a talking psychic dog, zany!

Honestly, I think one of the biggest issues with GOTG is that the quirkiness that made the first one fell new and charming now feels stale, laboured, and forced. In the first movie, it sucked you in and gave the characters real personality. Now, it feels like a template that pulls you out because it all but winks at you onscreen with a smirk while saying ""don't you just love how quirky this all is?""",2023-05-05

"While I‚Äôve enjoyed the marvel movies post endgame more than most. I have to say this is the first marvel movie I‚Äôve said I loved after coming out of the theater since then. Actually No way Home too.

I thought it was really good. I wish we got just a little bit more action but I thought the action scenes we did get were amazing. Especially the one with Groot/Peter and then the team one in the hallway.

I also felt they did a great job making High Evolutionary despicable. To the point that I was damn near ready to cheer when they kicked his ass at the end.

Also with Groot talking. Which I was not prepared for lol. But I interpreted that as he still said ‚ÄúI am Groot‚Äù like normal but it was the first time that we were actually able to hear what they hear in that moment.

I honestly thought with all the talk, early reviews, that some characters were 100% gonna be killed off but they left it open for more to come. I wonder who will take over from Gunn when they eventually do another movie, whether they will reunite everyone or just got with a mix of old and new members.",2023-05-05

Apparently after 7 years of real life time and like 10 years of movie time Adam still wasn't fully ready to come out of that post-credits egg.

They killed Lylla and it was obviously very sad but I was much more focused on the fact that they were probably about to kill Floor and then they did and I was even more sad. Floor was the best. RIP Floor.

Don't know what it is about ostensible franchise finales the past few months and long take action sequences that make me grin like an idiot in the middle of the theater but I'd like the trend to continue.

In different hands the High Evolutionary could have been forgettable but Chukwudi really elevated him. I don't know what multiverse shenanigans we'd have to pull to get this to happen but if they need to recast Kang, I know the first place they should look.

Actually pretty happy that they didn't have Gamora and Peter get back into a relationship at the end because the more I think about it, the more it becomes clear that there was no real way to do it that didn't feel forced. The MCU already kind of did a similar thing a bit awkwardly with another alternate self when they speedran Loki's character development, but this felt like she went through the same rate of growth that she went through in the first Guardians. Also very pleased that the side Guardians got their time to shine and that you could really feel Rocket and Nebula were close after those five years.

"This is the first MCU movie in a while - after Thor L&T, Wakanda Forever, Quantumania - that I didn't walk out of the theater not enjoying the movie. L&T was awful. Wakanda Forever was bloated and just not very enjoyable overall. Quantumania was boring and bland. This movie had definite flaws but overall, I had a good time.

Quick thoughts (and I may fill in some more): 

- Gunn does heart really well. When he wants you to feel something, he usually nails it. 

- Everything with Rocket was great. Again, Gunn does heart well. Rocket's first word being ""hurt"" was heavy. Everyone worrying about Rocket felt real. And wow, the body horror in this rough. I wish there would've been more sympathy at points by the Guardians and others when coming into contact with the HE's creations. These are fucking tragic beings who have been tortured at every turn, but for some reason we need Mantis to scream in horror when she sees one. And this is after seeing how she treated those giant - whatever those things are - which doesn't have a lot of logic. 

- The hallway fight was fucking great. It felt like a send off even though the movie still had plenty of time left. 

- I'm glad they didn't kill anyone off and allowed them all to have happy endings. Drax finding something he's good at and becoming a dad again especially was great. 

- Not having Quill and Gamora fall back in love was a great choice.  

- Warlock was a waste of a character. I know some people are gonna say he's an analogy to Rocket, and fine, but he didn't really do anything in this movie other than save Quill at the very end. Why didn't he play some role in taking down the High Evolutionary? I know he's just in this to introduce a new character - America Chavez, Riri/Ironheart, etc - but couldn't Gunn give him something?

- Anyone else just kind of laugh in these movies how easily characters just crash into each other, then crash through buildings or structures and then smash into the ground? Or get thrown into a wall? Felt like it happened 3 or 4 times in this movie (Warlock to Rocket, Gamora to Quill, HE to Warlock, Warlock to Gamora, War Pig to Gamora). It's like the director - of whatever superhero movie - doesn't actually want to think of how to have two characters fight. 

- The music in this one felt way overdone. I love Gunn's music choices, but none of them felt right because they were just constant. 

- The excess of silliness. Cosmo's ""good dog"" didn't need two additional scenes to payoff at the Knowhere battle. Drax's allegory jokes were funny enough...for the first two. Then he starts talking about poop which was eye-rolling. Gunn always has one or two really stupid jokes in his movies - like Suicide Squad with the beach of dicks or God's splooge. It's just...why?

- Gunn made you care more about the populace of Counter Earth in 5 minutes of run-time than the entirety of Quantumania made you care about Cassie or the populace of the Quantum realm.

- It felt like 80% of this movie was characters yelling or talking as loudly as possible at each other. 

- Didn't like High Evolutionary at all. Him mocking Rocket was just dumb. I never took him seriously or found him captivating at any point. I'm kind of shocked seeing the praise heaped on him here.

I'll be interested to see the consensus on this one when some time passes. I don't see much of any criticism in this thread which is interesting. Again, a very enjoyable movie but there are some significant flaws.",2023-05-06

And in the end, seeing them going their separate ways, was very heartbreaking.

"Went with a group of 10, ages 6 to 70. 

Everyone loved it. 

After the last couple of MCU films stumbled and didn't really deliver fully, it was great having James Gunn pull off the cinematic equivalent of Babe Ruth causally walking to the plate, pointing to the outfield and knocking it out of the park. He knew this was his MCU swan song and you can see that he poured his heart & soul into that script.

I don't think I've ever cried so much in a popcorn film. There were 4 adult men in the group and we compared notes to what made us lose it. The most macho of us admitted he held it together.... until the grandfather scene (he lost both of his).  My tears started about 30 minutes in and returned over & over until the end. 

As other's have commented on, every Guardian's arc is handled beautifully. Each gets either an end or new beginning. The Peter & Gamora arc is particularly well done with the door left open to perhaps a new beginning for them as they have learned who the other truly is now. 

The group's consensus is the best Guardians movie since the first (although I like Vol 2 more than most).",2023-05-07
"Wondered if gunn was going to appear on the screen so he could nearly die too. Jokes aside, decent movie with really good theming. So fucking glad they didnt joke with the rocket past scenes but idk i just didnt connect to the movie as much as i did the others. I dont really have much to critique apart from the fact that everyone had to have a nearly die scene, adam being a bit meh (atleast he was funny) and kinda poor pacing? Felt like nothing had time to set in bc it was oop off to the next place. Still wanna say it was a decent movie but just didnt hit that spot the others did, 6-7/10",2023-05-08

Initially I thought that it was nothing more than a cheep cash in on the anti-MCU speak going on, but I honestly agree after watching it.

The action in this movie and the scenes where they were trying to move to the next plot point held a lot of weight.

"Great movie. I like that it put story first and went dark when it needed to go dark not just for dark's sake. Each character got the right ending, but I don't think ending is the right word. There's plenty of room left for storytelling.

I don't think I consider this a trilogy though. Technically it qualifies, but my reasoning is that it didn't feel like the completion of one story.

For example, if the story had been different and focused on Star Lord and Gamora with Rocket just part of the gang. I wouldn't have felt anything was missing when the credits rolled.

But if Return of the Jedi had been about Han Solo, I would've been pretty annoyed that the Luke/Vader stuff wasn't wrapped up.",2023-05-08

The whole movie seemed to be juggling a lot, it definitely felt like a movie before the big finale and not the end of the story. Yet‚Ä¶at the end it sorta‚Ä¶became that. It almost felt like this should have been volume 2, and Quill being the hero and dealing with his dad would have been a more fitting way to go out. Gunn also seemed to be stuck with his previous choice to end the 2nd movie with setups for the third. Warlock was fine but it definitely feels like his plot was shortened or diminished (or un-needed). 


Was really surprised at how flat a lot of the jokes went over in my theater. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan but usually in marvel movies people are pretty  on board. Was juggling a lot of tones and I think people were pretty put off to laugh after they watched an otter die‚Ä¶that was pretty hardcore.

"This movie had a strong Christian overtone, no? There's the obvious Creation of Adam shot, which I don't think was earned, especially considering the meh editing. Like ""there's Creation of Adam"" ""oh the next shot is just Warlock grabbing Quill by the arm"". Honestly, Adam Warlock was a little under utilized. His mom says that he was awoken too soon and is just a kid, despite his looks and powers. This kid loses his mother and he flies straight to the only person he knows on an exploding planet. I think Adam Warlock is strong enough to take a bomb, so I think he should've collapsed from grief rather than that weird exhaustion we got. The moment he saw his mom die shoulda been the moment he turned his attention to HE. If that happened, then we wouldn't get the weird part where Adam bursts thru SL and Gamoras ship and they're just fine with it?? Did I miss something there? Why weren't they sucked into the vacuum of space? Honestly that moment where the three ships are just trying to get to point B and there's a bajillion space grunts to kill was bloated. Couldve used those 5 mins on something else. Honestly 1 more minute for each Guardian would have workee to plant seeds throughout the film so the breakup conversation at the end resonates more. Because honestly as of now it seems a little forced, like they only did it because the writer/director is going to their direct competitor to launch a cinematic universe because they fired him over a tweet he made forever ago, yknow? 
Because they do fight a lot. They're a dysfunctional family. The love is there, but maybe it's better that they tried different things. Gamora looked happier with the Ravagers than she ever did with the Guardians. It also seemed especially hard on Mantis, so they easily coulda added some dialogue between Drax and Mantis in the same scene where she's getting Drax to give Peter her advice, verbatim. 

That being said, I do love the movie. I cried a lot. For all of its faults, it has soooo much heart. Which I think is part of the point: love things as they are, not as they should be. This is something HE didn't understand. He hated everything because he's too narcissistic to turn that energy on himself, and there's a lot to hate. He can't fathom his flaws and limits, it's someone else's fault. And what's worse is that, even though he's a genius, he couldn't create with joy. It's apparent in everything he does. I kept thinking ""this design is very human"". I think it's most apparent with the juxtaposition between his high-tec boring space cube and Guardians backup pulling up with the tricked out skull of a long dead god! Everyone is unique and has something to offer. It's good to have friends. Dance and be silly.  

Oh yeah but it is sorta Christian. They brought the animals on to the ark, and what's more 3 guardians (Mantis, gamora, peter) go their separate ways, like Noah's children Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And then I already mentioned Creation of Adam. Rocket has a near death experience and sees his friends waiting on the shores of the other side, where Lylla says ""there's the hand that creates, and the hand that leads the hand. The story has always been about you, you just weren't paying attention"". I think that's pretty much means god has a plan for you. HE's employees all go against him when he proclaims himself as god. That's all that I caught.

But yeah, excellent movie.",2023-05-10

I had high expectations for this movie and I do not feel let down. It was just so refreshing for a marvel movie to finally not just feel like a stepping stone to the next movie. It focused on itself the way the the first run of the MCU movies were doing. But easily this is my favorite trilogy of all the MCU movies, and I'd argue that this one is in the top 10.

The opening sequence to Vol 2 was great, but there was just something beautiful about the long shot sequence for this one in Vol 3 as we followed Rocket through the streets of Knowhere with the shot cutting around the time we get to Quill.

Also, once baby Rocket uttered his first words ""it hurts"" I was done. Idk how many times I had to pretend I was scratching my cheek in order to wipe a tear away.",2023-05-13

Rocket's backstory was so well done, probably one of the best things Marvel have done in a long while. Our boy Rocket really went through it.

"What a movie. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best space sci-fi ever and this movie is awesome. Rollercoaster of emotions. I cried during Rocket's escape, I smilled during hallway scene and I was afraid they really will kill Rocket. And they listened to complaints about Drax and critiqued his character, but at the same time managed to ""reintroduce"" him - he isn't comic relief for movie, he is comic relief for people around him.   

And desings of everything is so cool. Animal-cyborg-soldiers look metal af and would've been coolest toys in 80-90s. Enviroments of space stations and ships are interesting to look at. Even thing which gives info balls from arhcive looks interesting.   

I'm not sure I like new Rocket's backstory, compared to one from comics. I wish it was better ending for his friends, but oh well, not everything works out in the end.  

They learned to give serious moments to sink in, without joke interupting them.  

And how the hell, they managed to make this movie so brutal with PG rating. Ok, Gamora shot some people. Ok, Nebula is cyborg so everything happening to her doesn't count. But...face without skin, directly in camera without cutting away and it's PG?! How?! Of course I'm not complaining, just suprised",2023-05-15

Too many moments where film stops to become a mini music video and other times too many characters screaming/cursing  at each other like children. Felt like too much time was given to those moments along with Rocket's dead friends. High Evolutionary felt wasted despite being very intimidating and compelling. 

Counter-Earth felt pointless and frankly cheap looking, was I supposed to feel something towards the animal-people? They barely got screentime before being blown up and not even dramatically, just boom.

Now, when they are getting blown up, the shooting was interrupted by fighting on board, so I‚Äôm sure they weren‚Äôt all killed. I go further, lying to myself that the imported 1950 US culture means they have some bomb shelters and decide to use them after the motorcycle stealing.",2023-06-15

My only issue is that how much the audience loved Rocket and how cute the other members of batch 89 were carried the film and allowed James Gunn (who I have never believed is really that talented) to get away with a significant amount of lazy writing (most egregiously that we are supposed to feel our heart strings tugged by the deaths of certain characters, but other characters - that have basically the exact same backstory - are OK to be brutally murdered).

One other note I would make is that I thought it was pretty clear that if it was not for the Pandemic, we probably would have got a different GotG3 where the Guardians plus Thor looked for Gamora (and the High Evolutionary was hinted at) and then what we know as GotG3 would probably be GotG4.",2023-07-23

"This movie had too many good ideas and it fell flat because of it. 

The best was the Rocket back story. That was executed really well. 

Everything else was executed poorly. 

The whole thing is three fetch quests. ""Fetch the passcode from location A, fetch the password from location B, fetch the people from location B"" 

Even with 2.5 hours, which is long, it felt rushed. 

The entire part with counter earth served no purpose. It was odd that he would make an ideal society be a 1980's American suburb with animal people. 

Like this is guardians of the GALAXY, it should feel bigger and not so earth focused. The comedy of a lot of the previous movies has been from Peter quill being a fish out of water overgrown American child in a strange and diverse universe. 

But in this movie... They use random earth animals for all their experimentation. Everyone is very human. The odd bio space station had great set design but the plot inside was super basic and could have been happening at a DMV. 

Fun side plots got lost in there being so many of them. 

Cosmo, Nathan Fillion, the other ravagers, the little kids, the sovereign... None of them had time to breathe. 

The other issue was that the guardians were too incompetent and bumbling and too blas√© about it. It made the stakes feel super low. There is a nice balance to be had between the conversation and the action, but we were way too far over on the conversation+frenetic action. 

Finally, the villain was poorly done. The cold scientist was a much better demeanour than the random screaming emotional guy. The guardians are the people who have trouble with their emotional control. Having everyone do it just reduced the threat level of the villain.",2023-05-05

In the opening scene I get it, thats fine. Then in orgocorp drax gets blasted by nathan fillion (who was amazing in this) and then theres sad music playing and then he's fine? Like why bother, that scene adds nothing to the movie.   


Then again near the end, Quill gets saved by Adam, and they recreate the God touching Adam painting, which was brilliant shot composition but it didnt feel earned at all. The latter half of the movie is really fucking good but I didnt really enjoy the rest of it. Oh also, dont appreciate the deadpool 2 ripoff scene, its just played out by now and it didnt hit as hard for me. Also, the mutiny near the end of the movie. You know he's super powerful, just shoot, or at least try to subdue him. What use is standing around going to be? Also the high evolutionary's idea of a perfect world being 1990s Earth was just stupid. Hilarious, but stupid.   


A lot of this movie felt like it was riffing on the big spectacles from other movies. If you told me the scene where Kraglin looks up at his city being invaded was from Avengers or Age of Ultron, I'd believe you. The space battle with the hellspawn didnt really hit, felt like a worse version of star wars fights. Also the rancor pit.that he just keeps onboard because why not? And then she does the jurassic world thing to get them to her side? I feel like a lot of these scenes could be cut out and were mostly just empty spectacle  


The latter half of this movie hits like a dumptruck emotionally, every single scene with Rocket was excellent, the Beastie Boys fight was perfection, Groot and Quill fighting onboard the pyramid was fantastic, Adam was a bit of a joke but he was fine overall, and most importantly, Cosmo is a very good dog!

I'm not really critical of the film, I liked a lot of it and I understood its choices, but I can't really get away from the fact that I found it a really hard watch to the point that it was upsetting, and that has stayed with me more than the uplifting ending, or the jokes, or the excitement. 

That rabbit desperately shouting for his friends to leave has stuck with me, I think about it a lot, and I feel uncomfortable. 

And I'm finding it frustrating that the conversation around this has been really dismissive. I've seen a couple of threads here and on the Marvel subs about how, sure, it's a bit violent here and there but it's rated appropriately and people shouldn't expect a movie is kid safe just because it's Marvel, But I don't think it's unfair, really, to make the point that the character of the violence, of the pain and distress, in this film is very different to anything we've seen in a Marvel movie up to this point, and I just didn't have my guards up for it. 

I've seen harder, more violent films. More horrible films, more upsetting films. But I usually wouldn't see them in the theatre where I find the volume and the scale a little bit overstimulating at the best of times. I went to see this with my partner, and we both just kind of sat for a bit after. We both found the film stressful in a way we hadn't expected. 

I said after that I'd have rather waited and watched it at home, but I'd never really have known that would have been the right way to go without seeing it.",2023-05-10
"Idk it kinda rubbed me the wrong way that the same movie that respectfully shows how terrible Rocket's life was also joked about Thanos replacing Nebula's eyes. She even says that Rocket had it worse than her, even though they were in a nearly identical situation",2023-05-12
"It was good but after 6 years of waiting, it could‚Äôve been better. The story was rather sloppy and reminded me of rise of skywalker (we gotta go here and get this thing! Oh wait, that didn‚Äôt work, now we gotta go over there and get that thing!). Honestly I think the story could‚Äôve been improved by having Adam take rocket in the beginning, then have the main plot be rescuing him, instead of meandering around. 

Also felt some scenes were really dragged out, particularly some comedic beats. In cases like the team talking to the animals in the house on counter earth, followed up by the car fiasco, I felt like one or the other could‚Äôve been cut. I don‚Äôt think this movie needed to be 2.5 hours.

However, I loved the villain and Rocket‚Äôs backstory was so tragic. Loved the cool animal army, their designs were great. Also loved how they ended things for the guardians team in general, there was a lot of tension with them as any of them could‚Äôve died at any moment, and all the ones who didn‚Äôt already die each got a scene were we were worried about them. However, I thought It was a nice subversion to have them all live. I love Quill‚Äôs ending in particular.

Adam Warlock was funny but out of place, definitely feels like he is only here because of the Vol 2 post credits. Thought it was weird he had pretty much no reaction to Ayesha dying. He was shoehorned in imo, and I think his arc could‚Äôve been better.

Gamora surprisingly worked well, I kinda think they should‚Äôve retired the character after her death in Infinity War, but the new version was still really good. Glad she went off on her own at the end. 

Overall I did like this movie, and it‚Äôs easily the 3rd best of the most recent MCU shows and movies. However, it wasn‚Äôt as good as I was expecting and hoping. Id give it a 6 or a 7, but I always have recency bias with these movies.",2023-05-05

Another disappointment to the pile of recent Marvel flicks.,2023-05-05
"Vol 3 definitely tops the sequel.

What a villain, legit hated this dude more than Kang.

Rocket's story fucked me up but I held it together in the theater... When I buy it later on down the road, I can cry in my home in peace.

I thought Quill would bite it but he wasn't as annoying like he was in IW and in part 2.

Glad rocket survived!

Overall, 4/5 stars!",2023-05-05
Thought it was okay.,2023-05-05
It was oddly dark and weird. I mean Guardians was always weird but in a good way. But I felt uncomfortable especially parts of Rocket's backstory. The cyborg animals at the end creeped me the fuck out too. Also what sick bastard does that to a rabbit? You know what I'm talking about.,2023-05-07

"
Like most have said, definitely best MCU film since No Way Home. Can't believe how much better this was than Ant-Man.  You can tell how much the cast really put their A-game into it. Loved how much Mantis we got in this. Lots of emotional scenes, some got me pretty good, some felt a little too tearjerker. Some of the animal stuff and gore at the end is gonna turn some people off. Gunn definitely pushed PG-13 as hard as he could.

Only real gripe is that the movie feels like it ends 2 or 3 times, with them having to save Drax Nebula and Mantis, and then the kids, and 
*then* the animals, **then** Starlord, it made the movie feel too long.


Curious to see where the roster goes from here. A Warlock show with the cast sounds too expensive, but what director wants to fill Gunn's shoes?",2023-05-08
"The Guardians individually probably have the best character arcs in the entirety of the MCU. This was easily the best movie since No Way Home and what the studio has needed for a while. 

Not really sure how things are gonna play out now with the whole Kang shit but at least there‚Äôs some hope again.",2023-05-08

"Chukwudi Iwuji was so perfect in his role as the Great Evolutionary, he literally made me shudder with his evil when he'd come onscreen.

Just after the film was over I literally turned to my friend and said, "" I'll bet you he's a shakesperean actor who's main background is theater.  No way this guy started in LA. He's too good.""

Went home and did my google search on the guy and sure enough...",2023-05-14
"The opening Creep scene evoked more pathos than the last 5 Marvel movies I've seen combined. 

Gunn just gets it. He was far and away Marvel's most valuable asset and they just let him walk.",2023-05-14
"Is it me or did Adam Warlock seemed under used in the movie? And High Evolutionary seemed awfully weak compared to his comic book source material. He took a beating from them just like Kang having a fist fight with Ant Man.

I wish the MCU came up with better ways to beat these powerful antagonists that end up becoming run-of-the-mill bad guys by the end of the film.

I would have preferred if Quill died in space. The emotion in the scene felt undermined with Adam coming to his rescue.

I'm seeing a lot of praise for the movie, but I thought it was OK. None of the action was outstanding or memorable in any way. Certainly better than the last few MCU films, but nothing amazing either. It felt a bit long as well, but I don't know what they've could have trimmed to save time.

Favorite scene was definitely the F-bomb. Totally unexpected and delivered perfectly.",2023-05-15
"It was good but I wasn't as in love with it as most people seem to be. All the Rocket stuff is top notch but the rest is just decent. By the current Marvel standards it's miles better than anything else they're doing but if it was part of the Infinity Saga I don't think it would be as praised as it is because it wouldn't really rise head and shoulders above many of those films. It's just my opinion though but for me most of the jokes didn't land and I was dissapointed that no characters died as that would make it feel more like a finale. I didn't really feel like this is the end because the way the movie sets it up all of these characters seem to be poised to return in future movies and I bet they will team up again, even if briefly in Avengers or something else. Also I much prefer the soundtracks of the first two installments. I dd really appreciate the darker elements and how it pushed the boundaries of PG13 though.",2023-05-05
"The drinking problem plotline was such a joke. Quill was completely wasted then a random villain shows up and hurts rocket after which Quill is alert, has a epiphany and the issue is never brought up again. Why even introduce it in the first place?",2023-05-06
"I really wasn‚Äôt able to connect with this film emotionally. The movie started off on a much more violent note than the first two, and it became clear early that Disney gave Gunn a lot of creative freedom. As soon as they started playing up the cuteness factor for Rocket‚Äôs friends, it was just obvious they were going to meet a bleak fate. The movie was manipulatively sad rather than organically sad, if that makes sense.",2023-05-09
"Maybe, this was not the movie for me, but as fan of the ""Guardians"" I did not like this movie at all. The ""Guardians"" are known for their light-hearted, silly banter, for their duffus approach to everything and while there were some tragic events happening, it was never the focus - the team was the focus, who did not straight up hated each other. Even in the ""Guardians"" game, where they were dealing with brainwashing cults, tragedies and the end of the Universe, I never felt sick and the story made me tear up without the need of seeing animals getting mangled and killed. I do not believe that James Gunn was the right director here - he likes mean-spirited and cynical humour, his ""heroes"" are flawed to the point where I do not like rooting for them, he likes dissecting sci-fi and superhero characters and tropes just like the High Evolutionary liked to ""experiment"" on creatures, the overall tone in this movie was either predominantly sappy or extremely bitter / mean. And ""The Guardians"" are just not that. I know a lot of people will disagree, because they love his work, but I hope people will realise that quality filmmaking does not equal excellent movie when comes to certain franchises. I am happy that his fans will get their twisted version of Batman, which everybody expected from Snyder, but for me the hateful bickering between characters, the disbalance between comedy and drama and the excessive reliance on shocking deaths and scenes are not going to get me to like DC more than I liked the Snyder's DC (which I did not). I LOVED ""The Suicide Squad"" and ""Peacemaker"", because it made sense for them to be cynical, mean-spirited and shocking at times. I did not expect nor I wanted for the most light-hearted of the Marvel teams to have the most bleak movie so far.",2023-05-05
"My favorite part was the Mission Impossible trailer at the beginning.  Man, I did not like this movie at all. 

I really enjoyed the first one, thought the sequel was average at best, and really disliked this one.

20 minutes too long, pacing was disjointed and all over the place, weak soundtrack.

And I thought these movies were supposed to be funny?  There wasn‚Äôt one moment where my packed theatre laughed out loud together (prior movies had several).  A few random chuckles here and there, but almost all the jokes and comedic moments fell flat.",2023-05-06
"This might be the worst guardians movie. It wasn‚Äôt bad but the guardians 2 was S tier and 1 was in my opinion little better. I think the villain had so much more potential. I think James Gunn said that this was the cruelest MCU villain and I‚Äôd like to say üß¢. I honestly think Ronan the accuser was worst than this guy and I think we needed at least one character death to prove this guy was a monster and needed to be stopped. I feel like the rocket backstory was carried by the fact that they were cute little animals and that contributed to the audience caring about them. It‚Äôs a little lazy but it does work. Probably the best action sequence in the entire MCU that one shot was amazing the chemistry was all there everyone was perfect even mantis who I didn‚Äôt really like before. Was Drax dancing supposed to be a sign of change? I knew that his wife hated dancing and this was his way of being like hey I can dance too now. Idk I thought it was nice. Action was great, comedy was hilarious, villain could have been better he had a good performance. Adam warlock was pointless you could have taken him out with little effect to the story I would say this movie is High B tier I don‚Äôt really want to put it into A tier just because I don‚Äôt think it stacks up to guardians 1 which is A tier",2023-05-05
"Part of me wishes this movie would leave my brain and the other part of me wishes I could live in this moment forever. What a beautiful fucking experience. 

Never did I imagine this movie, featuring brutal and horrific moments of animal cruelty and (literal) de-facing would end up as a story about being so happy and full of love that you have no other option than to simply dance about it.",2023-05-05
"Random thought dump:

* All the close up shots of Rocket‚Äôs face (and other raccoons) were sooo impressive. I love the leaps and bounds we get to see in CGI in our lifetime. 
* Loved the story focusing on Rocket too. Especially having it revolve around his backstory. In hindsight it feels obvious from the other movies this movie need med more Rocket exposition, but going into it I still had a feeling it was gonna be classic Disney focusing on Star Lord again. 
* Character resolutions felt great. Rocket Raccoon accepting his species; Nebula got in touch with her feelings; Drax got to be a Dad; Groot got to be the protector again; Mantis realized she wasn‚Äôt weak; Gamora found a family; and Star Lord stopped running from home. 
* Held it together when Star Lord was resuscitating Rocket, and when Rocket saw his Friends, but I could not hold it together after Nebula‚Äôs reaction to hearing Rocket was okay. Very touching. 
* A lot of the jokes felt a bit ‚Äòmemey‚Äô for lack of better word but there was enough humorous dialog/slapstick to hold on to its James Gunn GOTG roots. 
* Also remember how James Gunn almost didn‚Äôt direct this? Thank god‚Ä¶
* Also also, didn‚Äôt Janes Gunn and Taika Waititi talk about the resolutions of their films at all when they were collaborating? We can‚Äôt save a spaceship full of children ever movie guys‚Ä¶
* Chuk Iwuji was faaantastic. He was great in Peacemaker too, and I even remembered him from the tiny role he had on Doctor Who. 
* Felt a bit crammed with action scenes. Probably didn‚Äôt need all the explosions and what have you but it is a marvel movie so what can you expect. At least the hallway scene worked IMO. 
* Star Lord almost dying felt a bit too much. Especially after the emotional rollercoaster we just got off. Creation of Adam joke was funny at least. 
* Speaking of Adam, Will Poulter was good. It always seems like he just shows up in movies but always does a great job. 
* I forget the name of it, but the replica Earth felt a bit wasted. Like it was all Bojack Horseman and interesting and all it turned out to be for was a planet to blow up. Could have been cut, but also could have been expanded way more on.
* Groot and Rocket dancing at the end remind me of Jojo Rabbit‚Äôs ending
* Knew ahead of time Mowgli‚Äôs ‚ÄòSan Francisco‚Äô was on the soundtrack and was excited. Sad it was only like two seconds. That song has a good vibe and was expecting it to fit into the plot better like many of the other songs do. 

Anyways it was my favorite MCU movie in a while. Not as good as the first two, but still exceptionally good for ‚Äòthe third installment in a superhero trilogy‚Äô",2023-05-05
"I liked the movie a lot but the ending felt rushed. Like the set up a bunch but not enough to explain the ending. Rocket pulled a Batman from Batman Begins. I ain't gonna kill you but I am gonna let you die on this exploding space pyramid. Quill going from I'm cool with not seeing my grandpa again to ""Yeah I gotta leave and see my grandpa"" why? Because he saw a picture? Mantis was more understandable if it was like after Guardians 2 but her leaving also felt out of nowhere but I understand the working for her dad to working with her brother and wanting to do her own stuff for a while but again it would make sense if it was after 2. I think the soundtrack was not as good as the first two either but the use of No Sleep and Alice Cooper's Chasing Rainbows was excellent. All of Rocket's backstory was the highlight aside from the scenes mentioned, those felt the most well written and acted out.",2023-05-05

"I think it kinda dragged a bit between Rocket coming back and the final assault, but dammed if I didn‚Äôt love this movie. Teared up like 4 different times. I recently lost my dog so the scene of Rocket being greeted by his friend Lila as he‚Äôs dying just hit me like a brick wall. Probably didn‚Äôt help that it was a cute little animal too lol. That one-take hallway fight was awesome too, I usually kinda tune out during Marvel fight scenes but that one was great. I‚Äôm glad no one died mainly because it would have cheapened the whole plot being to save Rocket imo, sacrifices are over-done and their send off felt fitting",2023-05-05

"Yesterday I watched Star Wars: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back at home, then went to the theater to watch the 40th anniversary screening of Return of the Jedi. Today I watched Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2, then went to the theater for the premiere of Vol. 3. Both really fun days, and never before have I been more aware of the parallels.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this film, even though it wasn't exactly what I expected. I guess I fell for the rumors that their final outing would be a lot darker and we would lose a bunch of characters. As far as I know, we lost no characters, and the Guardians live on in a different form. I guess I expected more *finality* given with how this had been hyped for years. Not that I'm unhappy with the end result; I'm just not quite sure how to feel.

James Gunn has said for sure this is the end of his trilogy, and people like Dave Bautista have pretty much retired from the character. However, the ending tells us that ""Star-Lord Will Return"" which means the Guardians can still be featured players in other movies. But I'm not sure whether that's something I'm looking forward to, without Gunn's involvement.

Anyway, I'll take a step back and concentrate on what I liked about the film. The focus on Rocket's backstory was a highlight (along with Lylla, Floor and Teeths) and formed the emotional core of the story. (The way the movie opens, with Rocket listening to the acoustic version of ""Creep,"" had me crying for the first of many times.) Adam Warlock's involvement seemed almost negligible and The High Evolutionary was definitely one evil fucker. I found the whole Counter Earth thing both creepy and depressing, like a Twilight Zone episode. (Though it eventually lent to the first MCU f-bomb, which was surprisingly understated.)

I found Peter and Gamora's relationship here quite interesting, since it never developed into what they once had in the first two movies. So that felt quite sad to me that it ended on those separate terms. My favorite characters (since Vol. 2 and the Holiday Special) are of course the inimitable chemistry of Drax and Mantis. I could watch a whole series surrounding those two characters. So of course it makes me extra sad that they too are separated by the end. I think that's mostly what I'm left with at the end of this movie; bittersweet feelings. I'm not really a fan of the latest direction of the MCU and I feel like this might be the last time I truly find myself invested in this world, and that really bums me out.",2023-05-05

If I was Chris Pratt I would be knocking on James Gunn‚Äôs door and asking him to cast me as a character in the DC universe he‚Äôs building.

It was an emotional movie from the jump. I felt everybody got to shine in their own way and show growth. I'm a bit sad Gamora isn't with the Guardians but it makes sense. Not the same person. 

I'll always love watching Karen Gillan act she just is great at what she does. 

Rocket was the heart of this movie and it was so sweet to see. He's had such a heartbreaking life. 

As cute as Floor was I was continually creeped out. 

Drax meant to be a dad is so right. He really gets emotions. Him not telling Nebula about speaking the same language as the kids was funny.

Holy smokes the High Evolutionary is a terrifying villain. No justifiable motives but realistic motives. Sometimes it's great seeing someone who's truly evil get killed. This is the worst Guardians film with the best villain of the trilogy. I still really liked it overall though.",2023-05-06

Now he can spend some time on Earth, and when he's ready he can return to space adventures, hopefully much more mature like his early comic counterpart's charactization.

For me, it has the perfect mox of drama and comedy. I'm really glad the arcs of Drax, Rocket and Peter Quill were resolved. Peter went back to earth to reunite with his gradfather, honestly i would love a tv series or movie about him being back on earth.

Rocket found a reason to keep on living and become Captain of the Gaurdians, and Drax ended up becoming the father he was always meant to be.

The only downside was i was bewildered by the characters of Adam Warlock and his mother. They are such powerful beings,  why on earth would they be subservant to anyone? Also in the comics, is Adam Warlock a superhero or a villian, and why was he not more utilized throughout the Guardians and Avengers movies.

"Good movie. However, every cast and reviewer implied major deaths in this film. The movie teased those deaths so much but nobody died. Wish I went in not hearing anything from the reviewers, directors and cast, and I‚Äôd probably like it even more.",2023-05-06

"Why did the vilian want Rocket killed?

Even at a young age, Rocket was super advanced, could speak as well as solve complex math puzzles. Why on earth would he want to kill him?

If you wanted to start a civiliziation, Rocket and his three friends would be perfect in helping to start it up. 

By the way, he wants to destroy Rocket, but he had no problem with the multitude of creatures that would go on to live in counter Earth?",2023-05-06
"Only thing that felt force and cheap. Was glamora. I give her credit for being skinny and method acting to drugged out crimanal. 

But timeline she is from. Was when her and peter meet in hours. I call bullshit she never thought of betraying thanos. That was the exact time she committed to leaving thanos ""the whole time"" when peter was stealing the power stone.

It was cheap writing to get a star lord continuation movie. Or to write her out. If she wanted out of the contract for next movie. She could have been the one to sacrifice herself, maybe grow a little. She really had no arc and no reason to be there.  

Nebula really has been the break out character over the sagas. 

Rest of the movie was great.",2023-05-06
"Recall from the first movie.  Rocket's line ""ain't nothing in the universe like me, cept me""  

2 movies later you got rocket looking at a bunch of baby raccoons and realize that wasn't a throw away line about no one understanding Quil's earth references.  Having character development across 3 films like that... its just Incredible.",2023-05-06

Also, I will never hear Creep, Do You Realize, and Dog Days Are Over the same ever again",2023-05-07
"I really liked this film. Marvel finally puts out a great movie since Shang-Chi. It's more of a stand-alone and usually, they connect to the rest of the Marvel movies but this one doesn't. No Eternals (except Knowhere), no multiverse, no Kang. 

Despite having great action the movie doesn't give the audience time to breathe, especially when they revive Rocket, it's immediately back to action. I would've liked them to milk the dramatic parts a lot more. Warlock was a bit of a letdown, he was fine as a character in the movie but not compared to his comic counterpart. 

GotG 3 was very emotional and I felt like the movie did our main characters justice even our returning Gamora. I'm actually curious to see what happens to GotG afterward and Marvel can expand this title like Star Wars. 

They can get into the Universal Church of Truth, Magus, Darkhawk, Wraith, Cosmic Ghost Rider, Moondragon, Blackjack O'Hare, Noh-Varr, Quasar, Jack Flag etc.

I would love to see a Disney Plus series of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

FYI: If you guys want a book similar to Rocket and his storyline I would suggest reading the Pride of Baghdad and We3.",2023-05-07

"Honestly pretty satisfying way to conclude the guardians. Guardians was one of my favourites with the MCU and James Gunn nailed it with this third film. Pretty happy with how each members story decided to end.

On a different note loving that Groot just ended up growing even bigger by the end. Give hulk a run for his money in the size department lol.",2023-05-07

"Four days sitting on this movie now and my only critique is not seeing more of the sovereign, would have been more menacing seeing High Evolutionary/Adam with an army, those little Star Wars sabotage droid things didn‚Äôt do much for me.

"I went and saw this one with my bf first, typically I take at least one of my kids on first viewing. This movie was incredible,  however, the second I heard ""hurts"" from little Rocket and was introduced to his new friends, idk... it all just went so dark for me. I had this awful gut wrenching feeling through the entire first half+ of the film that was unlike pretty much anything I have ever seen. I can't honestly describe it. And when ""the"" scene happened, I couldn't stop crying and almost had to leave the theater. I'm very glad I watched it first before bringing my little one to see it. üò≠üò≠üò≠",2023-05-08

"Excellent movie with a lot of heart and some surprising risks. It feels like the natural continuation of the last two and is probably Marvel‚Äôs best film narrative-wise since No Way Home or Infinity War (infinite-ly better than Thor 4 nudge nudge). I still think John Wick Chapter 4 is the movie of the year for me but this is a strong contender, hopefully Dune: Part 2 knocks it out of the park.",2023-05-08

"My biggest gripe with the movie, none of the Guardians have no issue with Adam Warlock towards the end of the movie.  
Did they forget that he tried to kill them all at the start of the movie, and if not for a lot of luck, Rocket would have died.  
So because Rocket doesnt die, and he saves Peter, they are all cool with him?",2023-05-09

"Just saw the film yesterday and I don't know I didn't really like it ,I give it a 50/50 .

I feel that the movie was trying to tell a message i just don't know what that message was .

Take for instance in the first movie drax was hellbent on revenge to the point he was a lonewolf out to get Thanos so he sends a message and Ronan shows up and wipes the floor with drax .

Everyone gives drax grief drax realize he was wrong for going along to the point he shoots nebula with a bazooka and says something on the lines of ,messing with my friends .

But with this one they focus mainly on rocket and the only thing I could tell you was ....um I really don't know his orginal friends got killed and his new ones leave him?

I understood mantis leaving ,quill leaving ,drax staying nebula staying , Adam warlock.

But far as rocket I don't feel like for a story too focus so much on him so much I didn't understand his actions .

Like high evolutionary killed a whole planet of people plus rockets old friends, rocket I'm gonna let you go .....um why?

I just didn't understand that ,drax made a comment about everyone deserves a second chance .

I understood that with drax if anything he would know that,but far as rocker I just don't know .

Why  did he do that and plus I think he would be a terrible leader he was a notorious hothead .

If anything nebula would have been a better leader or mantis ,anybody but rocket.

I just don't feel for a movie that focused so much on one charector nothing was really set up. 

Star lords and gamora story and how they dealt with it and mantis talking to Peter about ponds made more sense .

Mantis saying hey I been following others I need to do my own thing made sense

Drax being a dad made sense

Nebula staying  made sense .

Rocket I just don't understand",2023-05-15
"Good fun!

Though I can't help but recall Josef Mengele and feel desperately sad. 

Also, they were all quite happy to fucking destroy everyone they came against (including other robot animals who had been tortured by the High Evolutionary) but they wouldn't take out the top guy himself.",2023-05-15

Mantis yelling at everyone constantly and the weak attempt to introduce Adam Warlock? Also, let's have Groot finally talk yet have the characters show zero reaction. What was up with the High Evolutionary's powers? They were never explained, he just had god like powers, but was relatively unknown throughout the galaxy. If he's destroyed civilizations hundreds of times in the past you'd think someone would've heard about him. I loved the first two Guardians movies, but this one just seemed lazy.",2023-06-05
"i had a few gripes with the movie‚Ä¶ 

a few moments felt tone deaf: mantis's ""forget"" part felt manipulative, then counter earth appearing and being made a mess of and then exploded with little emotional impact.

and i really hated that cheesy ""bad dog"" running gag ‚Äîgenerally can't stand what mainstream movies do to dogs.

i also found many of the fight scenes a bit too overloaded to follow.

‚Ä¶ but overall, it had a strong emotional core and was well-structured. definitely a standout among all Marvel films.",2023-06-07
I'm not sure how I feel about the gaurdians spilting up,2023-06-08
"I think it was slightly above average. But it has been getting tons of praise because the MCU movies since Endgame have all been mid to poor. Yes, even Shang Chi & No Way Home. This is definitely the strongest MCU film since Endgame.

Positives:

\- The emotional beats were mostly well struck. The movie does hit you in the feels.

\- Character work was strong as always with James Gunn. Gunn knows how to develop characters.

\- The villain was properly creepy although still as generic as ever.

 \- Great humor as is also the case with Guardians. Definitely had me laughing in multiple places. Although not having Rocket in it did steal some of the funny from before.

\- They did almost nail the ending. Left it on a great note. while there is a possibility of a return of the Guardians, with this ending they can also be done forever without any dangling story left.

Negatives:

\- The Guardians movies always had great visuals. This time around I felt that Gunn didn't experiment enough. With developing CGI and bigger budgets, I expected a visual feast but ala Thor Ragnarok but sadly this was not the case here.

\- The action was mid too. The one take action scene in the end was a standout but otherwise I cannot recall a single action scene which was memorable.

\- Wasn't really a fan of Nebula here. She just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest and her concerns for Rocket felt forced.

\- I feel the pacing was a bit off. Could have trimmed some scenes here and there and the movie could have closed closer to 2 hours rather than 2.5 hours.

&#x200B;

Overall GOTG 3 is a solid entry to the MCU and a fitting finale. Definitely better than GOTG 2 but I feel it missed the height of GOTG 1 which is a comic book movie classic.

Ay that war pig was fucking awesome. The sorceress alien was awesome. And some of the camera angles were interesting,2023-07-08
Imma be honest i really loved the movie,2023-07-09
"I absolutely loved the movie! And not only that, but after the credits, we see the new GOTG team appear with Rocket as their captain! Tbh, I‚Äôm hoping they get their own film series, which they most likely will get one, before or after Avengers: Secret Wars. I‚Äôm just hoping that Marvel doesn‚Äôt kill off Rocket anytime soon due to the fact that he isn‚Äôt completely done in the MCU. Yes, he went through a lot of character development and his arc was very fulfilling, however, at the end of GOTG Vol. 3, we can see that Rocket is given a new purpose and that he is now supposed to lead/guide this new team of Guardians! And seeing as to how Secret Wars will be releasing soon in the next couple of years, I am REALLY hoping Marvel won‚Äôt kill off Rocket yet. We haven‚Äôt even gotten to see how Rocket develops new relationships with this new team, which will eventually make them a family, just like how the OG guardians were! IMO, it‚Äôs gonna be so wasteful and dumb of Marvel if they decide to kill any of the new GOTG members off, including Rocket. Very wasteful. And we still have the opportunity/possibility of a new GOTG film series before and/or after Avengers: Secret Wars! Like, I can only hope Marvel can understand this and NOT kill off Rocket Raccoon. Especially not in Secret Wars. Also, after GOTG Vol. 3, Rocket is most definitely one of the biggest and most popular fan-favorite characters to exist in the MCU so far, so hopefully Marvel won‚Äôt kill off a fan-favorite character like rocket yet..especially not anytime soon since he‚Äôs finally getting a break after all the crap and trauma he went through in Vol. 3. (Like please, after seeing Rocket so tired and sorrowful for the entire movie, I NEED to see more happy Rocket with his new family in future marvel films to come..) üò≠

And to add on to that, I‚Äôve recently noticed that Marvel has been killing a lot of OG marvel characters recently, so I‚Äôm hoping Rocket is an exception to Marvels‚Äô mass genocide in the MCU‚Ä¶ üò≠üôèü¶ù‚ù§Ô∏è

But yeah this movie was a good send off for the OG guardians team, but i can‚Äôt wait to see more from the new team in future marvel films tho! Especially Rocket, since he‚Äôs the only OG guardian left in the new team!",2023-07-09

"I wanted to enjoy this movie. But I found myself just so disappointed by the end.
The stand outs of the movie are rockets story and nebula.
But the rest of it felt like a bad session at a game table. The team didn't ever really feel like a team, mostly felt like they hated one another most the movie. Star lord became cringe lord for 95% of the movie. The humor was mistoned for most of the movie struggling to decide if the characters were idiots or trying to be funny at the wrong times. These didn't really feel like the characters from the last movies. This felt like a jammed in and forced goodbye.",2023-08-05
"NO ONE ELSE IS SAD THE SERIES IS OVER?  Ugh, I have a sunken heart watching this, like when I finished the Harry Potter series, sad that it's over... Sigh, back to regular life I guess.",2023-08-06

"Aw man, just watched this for the first time as it is now out on Disney plus and I gotta say: the animal abuse was extremely hard for me to watch. Some parts I felt like I was going to cry. Good movie overall and some funny parts which I love about this franchise but damn yeah‚Ä¶some parts were really really sad and hard to watch",2023-08-17
"Very late to the party. I avoided this movie all this time because the trailers, and all the comments here pre-release made it seem like one of them died. My heart could not take it. But finally I said ""fuck it!"" and watched it last night. man, what a relief! it still hits your emotions like a truck, but it ends in such a high note. as always, GOTG does not disappoint!",2023-08-19
"Finally got to watch it, man what a great send-off to the old members of Guardians and the new one is looking like they are gonna be OP as well.

Adam scenes are fun but I wish he had more, with Ayesha just get killed like that is just tragic.

also the scene where the tease out Peter going to die freezing like Yondu just for Zune and making Creation of Adam gag feels cheap even if its kinda funny. since Peter is now home at Earth he could easily obtain new one and even send Racoon new one",2023-08-19
Rockets backstory scenes were the only good parts of the movie. Only parts of the movie that had crazy emotional buildup. Every other aspect of the movie made me feel I was watch some Spy Kids movie lmao,2023-08-26
"Everyone talking about Rocket, meanwhile here I sit, happy and tearing up over Nebula screaming with joy into the sky while dancing with children.",2023-09-12
"A very difficult film to review, because it does seem to be at general mediocre level of marvel films, but the rocket part, even if being the most typical story of revenge ever told again and again and again, did hit me quite hard.

However not having rocket in the majority of the Guardian's shenanigans is a huge downside. 

The villain is terrible (especially how underpowered he seems to be even when early in the film they said he is too powerful), Gamora could not have been in it and it would have been a better film (because there is a loooooooot of screetime with Gamora), you barely get to see Adam Warlock.

The only parts that I did like are, of course, most of the Guardians and their interactions (but taking Gamora and Rocket out leaves the group very weak), there are some action scenes that are really cool, and Rocket's story.

The ending feels very forced, its probably the only ending in the 3 Guardian's films where it doesnt make any sense that they suddenly want to go each their own way. I understand it has to happen because it the end of the era of the Guardian's for now, but nothing in the film really compels me to believe it. 

In the first one they barely kmow each other, so it would have make more sense. In the second one, the have to face extremely low odds of survival against a god/planet and even Yondu dies, so it would have make sense for them to leave it at that. In the third they expend the film trying to rescue the Guardian's members and no situation they go through is worse than anything they had experienced before (even tho the film wants you to think that 'oh look, they might die actually'!)",2023-05-05
"Good:

- The High Evolutionary: deliciously and horrifically evil!  Really hope he comes back because there's a lot you could do with a villain this twisted.  Someone check Sam Raimi's schedule and see if he has time for another Marvel movie because HE is a villain tailor-made for Sam‚Äôs deft hand.

- Rocket's backstory: Very effective and really makes you feel for him as he tries to terms with his existence.  When Rocket reminds everyone that there are more than just humans to saved, that moment hit hard and I loved it.

Bad:

- The Plot: Outside of Rocket's backstory, this plot is just a convoluted fetch quest a la Rise of Skywalker.  I also had problems with HE's reasoning behind wanting to recreate Earth... like huh? Of all the races, creatures, worlds, civilizations, you specifically chose Earth? That decision just felt incredibly contrived considering the diversity of the Marvel Cosmic universe.  It's even more frustrating when Gunn has leaned into this colorful diversity through out all three films. 

- Gamora: She just existed to give Peter ""feels"".  She didn't really exist as an actual character but as a checkbox to make it look like the team was back together for one final ride. It would have been more poignant to just leave her out of the story and have Peter deal with his grief with the help of his friends.

- Adam Warlock: Criminally underused... but I don't know how exactly one would have made it work within this particular script.  He just didn't need to be there and, for us fans of the character, it's disrespectful to just leave him in and give him absolute nothing cool/interesting to do.

Ugly:

- The soundtrack: Granted it wasn't as bad as the first two films but man, these tracks just do not work and reinforce the ""human centered"" universe trope.  It should be a cardinal sin to put Beastie Boys in any film soundtrack.

Final word:  I *love* Guardians of the Galaxy in the comics and I initially really liked the first movie.  But, as I‚Äôve rewatched them and now having watched the final film, I can‚Äôt help but feel like this experiment was a big disappointment.  Nothing that made the comics great made the transition into the movies. I guess what breaks my heart the most is that we‚Äôll never get a proper treatment of the D&A material and instead we‚Äôre left with this Bendis-ian piece of throwaway entertainment.",2023-05-05
"I don't understand why the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are so silly. I don't mean silly like funny, it's not funny, it's just dumb. Drax, Mantis and Peter talk like they are doing baby talk. And it's probably not a coincidence, it's probably how James Gunn directs them. Most of the movie feels like sketch parody. Like they stop in the middle of the action and Gamora says ""just admit you're making up what he says"". Like we get it, that was the joke, no need to spell it.

And why was Peter Quill talking to the aliens like a clueless American tourist in a foreign country? He's been in space for 30 years, hasn't he encountered a language barrier before? Saying words louder isn't going to help. He needed to do more miming and drawing and keep his voice down.

And the music is so annoying. James Gunn's music tastes are completely different than mine so the songs never give me that intended joy of recognizing a song you like. It's always just ugly Gen X music to me. I think there's only one song I can recognize and enjoy in each movie: ""Ain't no Mountain High Enough"" in Vol. 1, ""Father and Son"" in Vol. 2 and ""Creep"" in Vol. 3.",2023-05-07
"I'm baffled people thought this was a good movie. Completely ignoring the comics and viewing it entirely on its own, this was an absolutely lazy script. I don't even know why it was 2 and half hours. It definitely didn't need to be. If this is supposed to be the big send off for this cast, why play it so safe?  


I don't even know why Adam Warlock was even in it. Absolutely wasted that character. If this is one of the best as people are saying, I definitely don't want to see anything else.",2023-05-08
The whole build up was family/friends but it ended with them being like ‚Äúaight y‚Äôall‚Ä¶imma do me.‚Äù I expected more of a payoff.,2023-05-05
Why is it so hard for Quill to understand that this new Gamora is a completely different person? It‚Äôs not like she lost her memory. And everyone knows what happened,2023-05-05
Theres no way you people are real. This has to be a fucking psyop by marvel to increase movie sales. I do not believe for a second that actual humas are behind these words and ratings.,2023-05-07
"I admit I was pretty disappointed with this movie. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't nearly as good as the previous two.

The plot **desperately** needed downtime, but the structure of the plot didn't allow for any downtime. 5 minutes into the movie, Rocket is critically injured and they are in a rush to save his life for most of the rest of the movie. And when they finally do, now Mantis, Drax, and Nebula, meaning we immediately have to rush to fix that. Basically 2 and a half hours of nearly constant threat.

And overall the jokes just didn't land as much. There were small laughs throughout, but nothing was quite as funny as jokes from the first two movies. The Cosmo bits were the funniest parts IMO.

And Rocket felt horribly underused considering he's everyone's favorite AND he's the entire crux of the plot this time, but he spends 90% of the movie in a coma. And his backstory basically did not work for me much beyond the villain (who was great). The stuff in his cell felt like it would be straight out of a children's movie if you removed all the horrible cybernetics. I only really felt sad about them dying because Rocket felt sad. And then towards the end it did the super cliched ""Character sees the light while dying and sees their loved one who says its not their time yet"" bit. I couldn't believe they did it completely straight. It was nuts. Overall I just really wanted more Rocket interacting with the others.  


Speaking of interaction, it would have been nice if the characters didn't spend like 75% of their time interacting by yelling at each other. Just constant screaming. It got old. And I need to rewatch the first two to see how they used the licensed music, but it felt poorly used this time. I don't think the use of music stuck out to me in a bad way the first two movies, but here it kinda did. And none of the musical moments really improved their scenes like they did in the first movie. Certainly no Fathers and Sons moment like in 2. And final complaint, the cinematography just didn't feel nearly as inspired this time. 1 and 2 had some genuinely beautiful shots and moments that just made me go ""wow"". The only static shot that really stood out to me this time was at the end when Quill was floating towards Knowhere. 

For positives, Chukwudi Iwuji really sold his character. He was easily the best part of the movie for me. And I will say the big hallway fight once everyone finally got together was pretty fucking cool. I'll say if you took the time to read this entire whiny essay, know that I only wrote it out because I was genuinely excited for this movie. GotG1 and 2 are easily my favorite marvel movies and just great movies in general. I don't hate this movie, but for me it was just *fine*, and given that it's basically the sendoff for the director and the franchise, that's a big shame to me.",2023-05-07
"Feels surreal to read all the praise, this was some of the worst crap I've ever seen, tweecore reaching its final form.

The contrast between overly cutesy animal tearjerker shit and absolutely wasted gore and profanity, idek which tone they were aiming for, but I guess it's just the same old power of friendship/family nonsense.",2023-05-08
Adam Warlock definitely felt shoehorned in.,2023-05-05
Man I don't know if I can watch this movie with all the animal abuse scenes.,2023-05-05
LOVED THE MOVIE but a VERY odd choice for Rockets first mission was to‚Ä¶.kill animals‚Ä¶.,2023-05-06
"I‚Äôm gonna be honest‚Ä¶I really didn‚Äôt *love* love this one. I think I‚Äôm fairly alone in that. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbad,‚Äù I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever feel the need to watch it again. Definitely a strong villain though, and good performances all-around. 

I didn‚Äôt cry at all which surprised me. I think because the plot points just weren‚Äôt that shocking, so you could definitely anticipate the blows. Either that or I‚Äôm dead inside. But honestly the most shocking thing to me was that random end-credits scene with the cereal. LOL.",2023-05-07
"It was ok. Not the best written, a lot of it felt crowbarred in. The jokes didn‚Äôt often work and the music felt like they went shit we‚Äôre a guardians film better have some, rather than it flowing well like the first film.
Bit too on the nose in attempts to get you to care",2023-05-10
"Best Marvel movie in a long while, but that‚Äôs really not saying much imo.

I liked it, but it still falls victim to the same storytelling and pacing traps that are common to many other Marvel films.  

>	-> Spend the first third of the film setting up the story with ***painfully*** obvious foreshadowing 

>-> follow the hero‚Äôs journey template as closely as is humanly possible (but this time, with flashbacks!)

>-> cheap one liners that call back to the obvious setups from earlier *(‚Äúgood dog!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a raccoon‚Äù)*

>-> bittersweet ending

People have compared the villain to Thanos, but I think that‚Äôs a disservice to Thanos.  He‚Äôs certainly more *hateable* than Thanos was, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily the mark of a great villain.  I much prefer a sympathetic, relatable villain to this sort of unbridled-cruelty-for-the-sake-of-it stuff.

I was surprised with how dark it was thematically.  But, I found quite a few scenes to be needlessly uncomfortable for what is ultimately a film in a franchise that‚Äôs supposed to be relatively all-ages.

I also wish the jokes they told were just an ounce more original.  Most of the humour felt like recycled material from the previous two installations.  

>	*Haha, Drax is so dense!* *Haha, Mantis is so na√Øve!* *Haha, Quill is from Earth!* *And, get this!  Rocket?  He‚Äôs a raccoon!!* 

‚ÄúOpen the fucking door‚Äù was a great way to use a PG-13 rating‚Äôs one swear word, though.  

Overall, it was good for a Marvel film, but it wasn‚Äôt a *great* movie.  Definitely exceeded my expectations, but not by a huge amount.",2023-05-13
"The movie is‚Ä¶ good, and i appreciate that it took risks, but this was just too somber and depressing for a Guardians movie. The musical moments never hit, the action was mediocre (outside of ONE scene), the soundtrack was awful & it‚Äôs only memorable moments were reused tracks from the first film, and lots of characters did nothing the whole movie.

The ending was nice, but i felt wasn‚Äôt 100% earned. Felt like they had to end it just because, not because the story had naturally come to that conclusion.",2023-05-05
I feel like Gunn went fully unhinged with the violence and dark scenes because he knew it was his last Marvel movie and I kinda wish he dialed it back a little. The Guardians movies have always been more of an upbeat vibe for the most part.,2023-05-05
Nathan Fillion constantly bringing up that he has ‚Äúone of those‚Äù on his team had me in tears every time,2023-05-05
This was insane. i was so genuinely satisfied with this ending of a great trilogy. Can we just talk about the High Evolutionary?!? He‚Äôs 1000x better than Kang and was actually terrifying. What a great villain!!! we really went back to the basics here but in the best way possible!!,2023-05-05
"So what's the deal with Starlord not using his helmet anymore, especially in battle?  Did I forget about something in a previous film?

Also, I can't be the only one who thought the High Evolutionary was Red Skull when his face got ripped off.  

Lastly, this film sure does gloss over an entire planet being destroyed.",2023-05-05
"I like the Guardians disbanding but I feel like it was done in such a weird way that it‚Äôs literally my only complaint lol. They went through all that shit for Rocket and were so focused on being a family.

Peter saying ima head out was kinda jarring idk if anyone else felt like that.",2023-05-05
"This is the first Marvel film in over a decade to actually feel like a goddamned movie instead of ‚ÄúEpisode Yada-Yada of the Cinematic Universe.‚Äù There was a plot that went A-B-C, complete with emotion, gravitas, and (reasonably inserted) humor, but it did not feel any bit as ‚Äòmanufactured‚Äô as the grand majority of the MCU‚Äôs catalogue. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, the Guardians of the Galaxy are the Guardians of ‚ÄúMCU Humor.‚Äù I‚Äôm reluctant to suggest that this was James Gunn‚Äôs ‚Äúswan song‚Äù for his MCU contributions, but his touch was unmistakable. DC Films might actually get it together. 

That being said, this wasn‚Äôt a perfect film. Truth be told, my enjoyment of the film began to sap once the ‚Äòchildren‚Äô were introduced. I kept thinking, ‚ÄúHere we go again‚Äù as I looked back to Thor: Love and Thunder and how they decided to end that film. Thankfully, the children didn‚Äôt band together to defeat the villain like with the aforementioned film, but man- you can‚Äôt help but feel Disney‚Äôs grubby, insincerely polite hands all over that children‚Äôs sequence. The dance scene at the end was filmed damn near like a Disney World commercial. 

Also, the cop outs. I blame Disney once again, but I do have to ask: is it really THAT traumatizing to children to have to kill off a major character in a film that has gore all over the place (think of the High Evolutionary‚Äôs dismembered face)? Does Disney somehow stand to lose money in merchandising simply because a major character won‚Äôt be in the films (even though the likeness of the character can be made into toys for perpetuity)? Had one of Star-Lord or Rocket died, this would‚Äôve turned into a genuinely great film! Quit treating us like morons, Disney- we‚Äôre ready for something serious. 

Frankly, I needed more Adam Warlock. His ‚ÄúSixth Ranger‚Äù arc felt a little incomplete, and I enjoyed many of his scenes, as his flying scenes and dialogue had a very ‚Äúold-school‚Äù comic book feel to them. A part of me thought that this was a primer for what James Gunn wants to bring to the table for the DC universe. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt at the expense of an enjoyable performance from Will Poulter. 

Overall, I felt relief as much as I did enjoyment from this film. Relief that Marvel Studios is capable of making a normal fucking movie that doesn‚Äôt require hours of homework and doesn‚Äôt totally infantilize its audience. Walking out of the theatre felt like I was transported back to 2008 after having watched Iron Man for the first time. 

At the same time, Marvel Studios will not learn the right lessons from this film, and without James Gunn around to challenge the mouse (to a degree), I think that Marvel Studios will regress and we‚Äôre gonna end up with more of the same stuff. At least it was refreshing to see this stand out from the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô MCU fare. Even if you‚Äôre a Superhero film hater, this will be a pleasant surprise.",2023-05-06
"I enjoyed it, especially how they approached Quill and Gamora. Was worth the time seeing it. I didn't like how sad a good chunk of the movie was, just because it'll be hard to rewatch compared to 1/2. Ending sequence was the best out of the Marvel movies.

Don't like how Quill left the Guardians just to visit his Grandpa. Seemed unnecessary.",2023-05-06
"This is a top tier Superhero movie. Balanced all the elements correctly with heavy sad/dramatic themes on animal cruelty, God/Intellectual complex, ending relationships and moving on, communication and caring for loved ones. As well as comedy and amazing action sequences were all paced I'm a very effective way to maintain interest and invest in the characters and what happens to them. 

The High Evolutionary was pretty intense and despicable. I really liked Kang, and it's easy to shit on him now with the whole RL drama, but the High Evolutionary was far more intimidating and felt more consequential in the Counter-Earth than Kang did in the Quatam Realm. I also liked that he was emotionally fueled out of pure jealousy of Rocket than anything which caused him to act irrationally vs. Kang doing things to drive the story and plot. 

The Guardians also didn't feel OP and barley survived every encounter because they were not following Quill's plans, as usual, and were not moving as a until. They were at their strongest point when they came together at the end to set all the people and animals free. This was Rocket's story but strong performances from everyone, Nebula I think had the most growth and impact in this movie. 

A couple things I didn't care for:

- Quill fakeout death and save by Warlock, felt kinda cheesy and unnecessary, if it didn't happen nothing would have changed, could have had Warlock saving the animals to change your perception of him. 

- Gamora was far too aggro and she didn't even really come around, she didn't have to end up with Quill but it was a mistake to not have her realize she had a place with the Guardians. 

- there wasn't enough Rocket and Groot as their relation was important, but I guess we got that in all the other showings. 

- Ravagers just dropped Gamora off and disappeared?? They had a dude with Dr Strange powers why didn't he just portal them into the place instead of all the crap they did to get in.
 
- Gamora was disturbed by the High Evolutionary destroying Counter-Earth and asked who would genocide and entire race, or something like that, but at the same time was working with Thanos and didn't turn good like the Gamora from their universe.. just a weird line and context kinda took me out.

Overall a great movie, 9/10 for me and I look forward to Gunn building the DC universe.",2023-05-06
"Maybe a little too long, but this is easily the best MCU film in years. Finally a good balance of jokes and heart, and a standout villain as well. Amazing end to the trilogy",2023-05-06
The best thing about this movie is that this proves James Gunns right about how there's only superhero fatigue depending on the type of story being told. And that's what movies like Black Adam and Quantumania are missing.,2023-05-07
High Evolutionary was done SO much better than Kang was,2023-05-07
My group felt the movie was not great. Scenes dragged on. Overly brutal. Destroy an entire planet and barely mention it. Frantic pace and dragged out and too long at the same time. Glad others enjoy it.,2023-05-07
After 3 movies we all are able to understand groot now was a lovely touch.,2023-05-08
"I loved it.

Chukwudi Iwuji is easily one of the best villains in the MCU as the High Evolutionary. I looked into his filmography because I was curious about other work he's done, and noticed he is classically trained. That really came across in his characterization of the High Evolutionary as a megalomaniac genius hell-bent on capturing Rocket (not simply due to some technological advantage Rocket's brain has but also because he surpassed him in intelligence despite being his creation). 

Reminded me a bit of the contempt Peter Weyland feels for David in the new Alien films, although obviously the High Evolutionary has completely descended into madness. 

Rocket's flashbacks were devastating. Probably the most emotional of any MCU film. 

All-in-all, I thought this was a good ending to the franchise in its current form.",2023-05-08
Pretty wild that they murder a dude and rip a computer out of his skull.,2023-05-10

"It‚Äôs been days and this delivery from Bautista is still making me laugh. 

Drax: are we pretending to be angry again? Mantis! You asshole!",2023-05-11
"So things I liked in this film...

- Everything with Rocket, including other character's interactions with him (like Peter's reaction when he comes back on the table).
- Drax's arc and how they pay homage to the previous films and Christmas special (his almost sibling like relationship with Mantis). It was truly beautiful. 
- Nebula's arc in the film.
- How the jokes (for the most part) don't undercut the tone when it's truly serious and how they mostly land well.
- How it is very much stand-alone from the rest of the current MCU.

Things I didn't like in this film (in no particular order).

- The runtime is pretty lengthy. You could easily shave about 20 minutes off of this film and lose nothing. I won't detail everything, but two examples are... 

a) The house sequence on Counterearth could be completely cut and replaced with them just stealing a car - it is completely within character for them to do this. 

b) the time spent on that fleshy planet could be reduced. Keep the jokes thay work, ditch the ones that don't.

- Mantis. Did Mantis' ending seem a little weird to you? Like they didn't know what to do with her. That's how it felt for me. And I think you can kill two birds with one stone here for me, or rather two issues that I have with this film. 

a) They fake out deaths so much but never follow through with it.

b) Mantis should die in this film. She can have a fucking hero's death, as she damn well deserves, but she should die. Her death would add so much to the film, especially if they keep a few fake outs first so we start to think they don't have the balls to actually do it then, BAM, Mantis is dead.

- Gamora. Obviously, this is not the Gamora from Vol 1, Vol 2, or Infinity War. But, she is from the same time period as when Peter steals the Power Stone, and so she would be in the same head space as our Vol 1 Gamora. And she just wasn't. She was far, far too savage and angry. I get she has been dumped in another universe, but...

a) She would 100% stick with Nebula as Vol 1 Gamora loved Nebula, at least initially, and it is clear she didn't after Endgame. 

b) She was the moral heart of Vol 1. Making them do the right thing whenever possible. She was not an angry, needlessly violent bitch.

c) I believe she would at least hear Peter out if both he and Nebula told her about the life he and his Gamora shared, rather than just fucking off without giving him the chance to explain himself. Honestly, this is my biggest issue with this film. Her character was completely off, and it's ruined her character arc in a sense.

- Leading on from Gamora is Peter. Now I actually love how they both end separated. But how they got there was all wrong. Peter held his own most of the time, but when Gamora was about to beat the shit into him, he should've fought back, at least with words, telling her how they are going to save their friend and she will have to just stomach that until it's done. 
I also believe they should've made more about the photo of him and his mum and grandpa. His whole arc of this film should've been tossing up whether to chase Gamora or go back and see his grandpa, or at least pay his respects to his and his mother's grave. Obviously he will play his part in this film for the main plot, but I would've preferred Gamora and Peter slowly coming closer over the course of the film, culminating in a scene (after he almost dies - where she should totally join in the hug) of just the two of them where they kiss. This can either be romantically or simply as an experiment for both of them.
After it, he can realise that while she is Gamora, she isn't HIS Gamora, and so he gets closure on HIS Gamora being dead. Gamora can then go do whatever she wants, it seems like Zoe Saldana wants out of the MCU so she can stay and help Nebula and Drax perhaps, as neither of them seem eager to return either. While he can go back home as both the woman he loved and his sister Mantis are now gone. So it makes sense for him to head back to earth and leave the other Guardians - especially if Gamora stays.



- Finally, while Rocket's arc was superb, the rest of the main characters, especially Peter and Gamora, did suffer due to this. But this is more of a minor quibble.

All the above being said, I did enjoy this film. It is my least favourite of the three, but I will still watch it again on future, I don't hate it by any means. It was good. I was just disappointed that it didn't wrap up as nicely as I expected it to.",2023-05-11
"I know that the Marvels is coming out and they will probably keep making space adventures, but GOTG 3 is the last mcu movie for me. They are never gonna make a movie as good as this.   


Quantum Mania and Thor L&T both had space adventures but what they were lacking was the heart. This movie had so much heart, it had so much humanity and empathy. The characters were taking the situation seriously. It was like an anti-marvel movie.   
Here is the part that is the most ironic. GOTG comes out surprises everyone and Marvel starts making every movie like Guardians of the Galaxy 1, and they take everything from that movie but only on the surface level. This keeps going on they keep making movies with the same humor, same tone and they can't make up their mind about anything and make so many changes that the end result looks like a cheaply made B Movie. There's no creativity anymore, you can edit together and interchange scenes between Thor L&T and Antman Q and it would look like the same movie. They were both really badly made Guardians of the Galaxy movies and without the heart.   
In GOTG 3 when we cut to baby rockets eye's close up, a full cgi shot looking as realistic as possible and me getting a gut wrenching feeling in the heart seeing this poor defenseless baby in pain I knew I was in for something special. The camera movement is dynamic, the movie has so much creativity, but the heart and what it says about empathy and humanity hits so deep for me.   
I will give you a small example, In both Avengers IW and Endgame they both have scenes where they joke about Rocket being a talking raccoon. It's like the MCU self referential humor ""wink wink we know this is a talking raccoon"" but these jokes always come at the expense of the character. There's not even one joke that winks to the camera like that. Rocket's story is taken 100 percent seriously and touches on some extremely dark and disturbing imagery. My point here is the characters take the story seriously, there's a tone, the camera is dynamic, and a lot of it is practical.   
Another example is the disappearing helmets, GOTG 1 was the first movie to do it, but in that movie it was done with care and it made sense for the character to wear it and then they started doing with everyone (even Spider-man and Bruce!) overtime it just became a lazy way to have the helmet off for actor's screen time. They took something good overused it and ruined it. This movie look has no shot where a helmet cheaply appears out of nowhere. It's a solid vision from the first frame to the last it has a message about Animal Cruelty, humanity.  
It is the new benchmark, there's so much heart in the movie it's contagious. After so many years I've seen a marvel movie which brought something new to the genre. This is why it's my last MCU movie, ending this journey on a high note. Considering the amount of slog I sat through I don't think they are capable of making another movie like this.",2023-05-14
"They could've used any AAA actor to play another forgettable MCU villain, but Chukwudi just straight up killed it.",2023-05-14
"man, I honestly really dislike this movie. It wasn‚Äôt bad. But it definitely was NOT as good as the first two! It‚Äôs a shame because I was really looking forward to this film :(",2023-05-16
"Am I the only one that found that the movie was full of screaming? Like at all scenes if an actor wants to show emotion they just scream. Maybe it bothered me more than it should but it just broke the immersion for me. ^^""",2023-07-09
"I want my 2 hours back. But unfortunately I cannot get them back. I am bit sad. I really enjoy Chris Pratt in several movies, like in Jurassic World Series. Bradley Cooper did amazing as Rockets voice, one of the best voice acting I've heard in a while.

Was there anything good about the movie? Visuals I guess. Beautiful CGI as always. Crumbling buildings. Haven't seen that before! I did somewhat enjoy Rockets backstory. But it tried too much to be a tearjerker. But other than that? I was bored. After 1 hour of watching it felt like i've been watching it forever. Mindless, boring action without tension. Jokes, jokes and some more jokes. Don't get me wrong, action movies can have jokes. Look at Lethal Weapon or even Die Hard. Or Nolan Batman-trilogy. They have jokes in them. But not all the time! Everybody is a comedian. That is a problem in modern superhero movies. It takes all the seriousness and tensioun out of a movie. Sam Raimi Spider-Man are fun movies, they still take themselves seriously.

Anyway, didn't enjoy the movie. I did like the Vol 1. while Vol 2. was little worse, I still enjoyed it more than this one. I did like Antman Quantumania much more.",2023-07-11
"Humor was excellent throughout, laughed out loud probably a dozen times or more. Song choice was noticeabley worse and more ""general use"" songs were in the movie this time. Only real big stand out musically was The Flaming Lips - Do You Realize, but they cut that out at the best part of the song... The plot was all over the place, without spoiling anything I will say Adam Warlock's introduction action scene makes zero sense when you discover what he was sent to do. A lot of it felt lazy, like everything on Counter-Earth was just cheap animal costumes and zero creativity or logic for the world, space also has zero logic applied with multiple suits being opened, cockpits in space being breached, and even Knowhere getting opened up to zero issue, until the last scene in space where space does actually behave like space all of a sudden. The characters have mostly become Flanderized too, which is pretty disappointing, and I have a strong feeling Disney is pushing for more children in all their comic movies now as this and Thor were jam packed full of children. Still better than most MCU stuff since Endgame, I'd give it a 5/10",2023-05-05
"This movie felt like a successor to Vol 3 in the worst possible way. The characters were reduced to the barest caricatures of themselves, the storylines weren't cohesive and in some cases were outright illogical, and with the exception of Rocket's the character endings didn't feel earned.

Get the thing, oh no this doesn't work, let's get the other thing, oh no this doesn't work either, let's get the other thing....You can cut out that entire 20 minute meat-planet section and it would not change anything.
Also so many convenient things that make no sense. There's a scene where the villain has captured Drax, Nebulla and Mantis, and he tells Quill that he will give the coordinates to his ship so Quill can bring him Rocket in exhange for the others. Quill tells him to go fuck himself and then the connection is broken. Without telling the coordinates. How the fuck are they supposed to find them? Doesn't matter, next scene they arrive at the enemy ship and even Craiglin shows up with the spacestation to save day. How convenient. It took me out of the movie. It is easily the weakest of the Guardians movies for me.",2023-05-05

 There was some weird plot devices and it dragged on way too long near the middle and towards the end of the movie. 

I don't wanna sound like a fedora tipper but the scene where the villain says there's no god and then the entire crew decides to mutiny him for saying that made me cringe hard. Atheism doesn't deserve that sort of unnecessary prejudice. Especially in a marvel movie.

"There were some intensely cringe moments in this that made me physically recoil in gastrointestinal pain. Why, Marvel why. Perfectly good setup, good potential and they just need to inject heavy cliche, campy cringe-ass moments. Like the kids. What is this obsession with Marvel needing to have a gaggle of random fucking kids that we have ZERO connection to, needing to be saved. Just like Love and Thunder. Probably the same dipshit at Marvel coming up with this idea. I don't care about random kids that we as an audience have no connection to. Giant crowd of animals needing to be saved? Fuck yeah. Now that makes sense, because it's directly related to the plot. Just do that instead.

Predictable mohawk guy with the predictable needle bullshit at the end ‚úîÔ∏è (holy shit many flying enemies are pouring in at once, and this guy fucked up his needle attack previously, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN?!?!???

Bad dog running gag leading to good dog all along at the end ‚úîÔ∏è (NO WAY, [PRANK GONE WRONG])

Alien tentacle monsters, giant, ferocious and deadly, that choose to inch slowly towards their prey than pounce on the fuckers and kill them as they should, because plot ‚úîÔ∏è

Sylvester Stallone popping in for a quick paycheck ‚úîÔ∏è

Groot saying ""I love you"" gave me end stage renal cancer. Vin. Listen here Vin. Just stick to ""I am Groot"" ok? Don't-listen to me, just. Just don't. He could have said ""Family"" and it'd have been better because that's a big meme

Villain was fantastic in his acting, but I wanted to see some sort of motivation behind his crazed experimentation apart from ""evil looking bad guy with evil looking henchmen"". Show us his past so we can understand his motivation. The Handsome Jack-esque design was great though.

It could have been a really solid movie but these weird off-kilter choices just sours it all somewhat. The ending dance nearly shortened my lifespan by a few years. Ah yes, the city is in ruins, and everyone's badly hurt. LETS BUST OUT THE FUCKIN MOVES and another 50 soundracks because fuck yeah we paid for the rights.

"I just got out of seeing it, and I am probably going to get downvoted, but I did not think it was nearly as good as everyone is saying. It felt very uneven, some of the acting was really bad throughout, and this one probably had the worst writing out of all three movies. The only thing that was superior about this one was the flashback scenes. The flashbacks to Rocket and his friends was beautiful and sad and tragic. Some of the action scenes were fun but long. The film felt over long. Also, they made Mantis way too over the top camp and cartoonish in both the Christmas special and this. 

I see people putting this one in their top 5 or 10, and while I respect your opinions, I disagree. I actually think it‚Äôs weird people hate on Eternals so much but are loving this. Eternals was a much better made film than this.

I loved Cosmic the Dog and found it cool when it could have been stupid and cheesy.",2023-05-05
"Kind of a hot mess, I thought.

--You know how we keep saying that the MCU makes TV shows that should have been movies? This is a movie that feels like it should have been a streaming series.  There is enough material here for 6-8 episodes of television and nothing has a chance to cook before we're on to the next ""go here to get the thing and do the stuff.""

--Gamora and Quill's Farscape relationship felt like it should have been front and center and instead it was an afterthought. I waited six years for a few shoehorned in scenes between them? We had a better payoff to Gunn's brother learning how to use his fin than we did to a five movie long romance arc.

--The High Evolutionary was like 50% Thanos, 50% Kang, 50% the bad guy from Serenity played by Chewiebeetle, and 50% the boss from Peacemaker. A very big villain!

--I can't be the only one who expected a just deserts style comeuppance where the bad guy gets jammed into his evolution chamber and turns into a brundlefly monstrosity, right? Cause what we got felt super anticlimactic.

--Warlock losing that gold chick should have been the moment he was recruited by the Bad Guy and turned into his Vader henchman. This felt like an obvious missed opportunity to integrate two wildly disconnected narrative strands.

--Too much CGI pixel vomit, but it looked a lot better in parts than other recent MCU efforts.",2023-05-07

"Haven't felt disappointed by a movie like this in so long.

I felt like Vol 2 had such a strong thematic hook, with the whole message of chosen family. Quill has to accept that his one blood relative wasn't as important to him as the friends he made. Yondu, Gamora, Nebula, Groot all have to grapple with their dysfunctional families. It felt tight, fun, and potent. A story about people learning to appreciate what they had.

This movie's just a mess. The first half or so is insanely good. That intro sequence is amazing, the Rocket backstory is emotionally charged but wow, there's no subversion at all to the point where it just feels insulting. His friends get shot because of course they do, the villain is just this loud, irritating nerd, and how do you have all of this amazing licensed music and go for the generic, ham-fisted orchestral shit for the scene in which you bring Rocket back? 

There's no subtlety, no clever twist. The Rocket backstory could've been explained in less flashbacks, but drags itself out even though we know how it ends. It feels like there are endless death fake-outs that  are impossible to take seriously given the overall goofy tone. And of course it ends with a huge explosion-fest in space that goes on for fucking ever.

I understand a lot of people just want to spend a little more time with these characters and that's fine. There are some funny bits and that hallway scene is dope as fuck. But I felt like Vol 3 squandered the opportunity to do something new and interesting with these characters. It just comes off as trying way too hard to force some tears out of me by cashing in on my attachment to the characters developed in the first two.",2023-05-08

"**Pros:** Action and CGI were good - the one take hallway fight scene was a standout in particular. It's Marvel, so the production values will obviously be top-tier. Some of the humor was funny - that f bomb joke got me laughing out loud.

**Cons:** This film was quite disturbing in a couple of ways: namely the the first third of the film taking place in a planet made up of actual flesh and body parts which was and just plain weird. Also, all of flashbacks and references to surgery and torture done on animals, i.e. a bunny with spider legs, otter with its arms cut off, really grossed me out and was very unpleasant to sit through.

**Overall Guardians of the Galaxy 3 (2023) rating: 4/10.** I personally wasn't a fan of the grotesque imagery to be honest.",2023-05-07
"Random assorted thoughts on this movie:

* I think it's kind of fascinating the saga of James Gunn getting fired then rehired after Guardians 2. I feel like he was given the proverbial keys to the (Disney) castle for this film, which may have hurt the movie.

* The main thing that stuck out to me was how grotesque it was at times. From the decapitated Groot to the decapitated War Pig to the ~~Sovereign~~ High Evolutionary's mangled face. I loved it, but I wonder if that wasn't too much for general audiences? There was also a scene in that hallway fight where Gamora (or Nebula?) knifed someone in the knee then they swung off it that was fucking brutal.

* I feel like the editing of the Rocket flashback scenes hurt the flow of the first half of the movie. Maybe that could have been a single 5 to 10 minute scene at the start instead of interrupting the action throughout. 

* I get that this franchise has been centered around talking animals from the start, but hanging so much of the emotional core of the story around the robot bunny, walrus and otter felt like a mistake to me. Maybe just make them all raccoons for simplicity's sake?

* Between Rocket's family, the furry planet genocide, and the evil furry robots, I felt like the movie leaned too much into weird shit for my liking.

* The extended sequences of children in cages was some very charged imagery in the current political climate, that I don't feel like the movie had enough to say about to justify its inclusion.

* Chukwudi Iwuji was so over the top and intense as the High Evolutionary, I loved it. Fuck it, cast him to replace Jonathan Majors as Kang.

* I wonder if Dave Bautista had a clause in his contract stipulating that he didn't want to get ripped again for this movie, because I don't think Drax ever took his shirt off throughout the film.

* The B-story arc of Kraglin learning how to use the arrow and calling Cosmo a good dog was fantastic. The arc of Adam Warlock was still ok, but a little less effective. 

* I get from a realism standpoint (insofar as you can strive for realism in plots about time travel) why they wouldn't Have Gamora fall in love with Quill again. It still felt narratively unfulfilling though to have her end up with the Ravagers again in the end.

* Also, it seemed weird how Gamora called to be picked up by the Ravagers, they never came, and she never questioned that. In general, they seemed to kind of hand wave over Gamora just being part of the team again.

* Some of the CGI felt very grounded to me (like the hallway fight) while some of it (like the planet destruction) fell into the Ant Man 3 pitfall of not setting up sufficient spatial geophagy or stakes.

* While I loved the song choices in the movie, some of the attempts to make the music diegetic didn't work for me. Like you understand that Quill is playing tracks off his Zune in Nowhere or when going into battle, but why is there music playing in that fight in the organic space station?

* Overall I loved the movie. Gunn's humor and sensibilities didn't wear on me like Taika's did in Love and Thunder. It was a little long with the Rocket flashbacks, but overall it was an excellent picture and a stratifying end to this trilogy.",2023-05-05

"I hadn‚Äôt realized how badly I needed Rocket to say his full title until now. Absolutely perfect moment. I loved that the villain had a personal connection that really drove his hatred.

The first end credit scene reminded me of the original concept art I saw for the Guardians of the Galaxy when it was announced with the location, suits and Groot‚Äôs design a bit as well. Really loved Groot. I feel like it was definitely an improvement from the Christmas special where he just looked like a guy in a suit, but here, especially when he came apart it felt very alien. Glad to see Groot is still a hoot crazy goofball who can kill a bunch of aliens when you need it. Kraglin‚Äôs fin also improved since the special where the skin was looking a bit weird. Speaking of skin and looking weird, I can‚Äôt believe they were able to show that guy without his face. My Nephew and I both thought he looked like Red Skull lol.",2023-05-05

"Maybe I was supposed to feel *""feelings""* or maybe I'm dead inside... but I felt through the movie that the writing was trying to do some kind of *""emotional blackmail""* on me with the little critter scenes... but nah!!

Also there was no meaninful deaths or actual **REAL** emotional moments, and at no time I believed any main character were in any actual danger.

Also the movie started out great but at the middle, it became somewhat of a mess and I didn't know what we were doing, or where we were going until the third act.

But overall it was a fun, comedic, right-pace movie and I supposed it was not to be taken seriously *(there were scenes were the Guardians were acting like morons, and honestly it was too much. also Gamora was too much of a cunt at times!!)*

Yet I give it a 7 out of 10 (I guess it was the correct, right amount of cocaine for James Gunn to write/direct and drag me to the movie theater and entertain me)...

The animal people will forever haunt my dreams. Forever.

Gamora ended in a good spot. She acknowledged that Quill is lovable, and she accept some version of her would love him. She is still NOT that version. 

Downsides: Adam Warlock was unnecessary and wasted. Groot ""I love you guys"" sucked. Do ""I am Groot"" but with subtitles. Actually no subtitles, change the dialogue from the others a little and just have no clues as to exactly what Groot said. Let the audience decide.",2023-05-05

"L O L is the message all life is sacred, animals, humans, bounty hunters, and even the High Evolutionary need to be saved? 

Because they sure did MURDER a lot of VICTIMS. 

I laughed when Adam Warlock asked why he was spared because he has every right to ask. No one at any other point ever spared anyone prior and even the guy that thought he was being spared got brutally murdered. I wanted to shout at the screen BECAUSE YOU NEED TO SELL MORE TOYS. 

If you're going to spend the whole movie making me feel bad for High Evo's experiments why are you going to show them being mindlessly and senselessly slaughtered. Not even triumphantly you slaughtered them with murderous glee. I can't really root for the guardians when their only motive is self preservation.

ALSO Peter telling Gamora her ravager family isn't a real family because they're just a bunch of criminals. PETER You IMBECILE. You spent the entire last movie discovering that they were more of a family to you and Yondu was your dad. ALSO YOU ARE A CRIMINAL. You MET IN PRISON. Like I get Peter's a dumbass but he also isn't because he understood the pond metaphor. 

Mantis is also horrifically underused yet again but you can't make a Marvel movie with consistent superpowers. 

 I also have to be honest I know we give James a pass on the using insert songs but IMO it was a little overdone. Just because you can do it well doesn't mean you have to force it in every 10 minutes.

It was terrible tbh,2023-05-06
"I wanted this movie to be great. I really did. The first GotG movie was my first MCU movie I saw on the cinema and I became obsessed with the francise since.

There isn't anything that makes it stand out from the other MCU movies. That was another one directed by MCU accountants. This should be a definitive and satisfying end to the Guardians story. They should ""all fly away together one last time"", yet none character get killed, giving the opportunity to produce 5 more of average movies.

I don't feel characters fates were resolved. Peter spends the whole duration of the movie trying to impress someone who only resammbles his loved one and they both end up alone in the end. They should address that the one he loves died on Voromir and he moves on or do falling in love once again. Drax and Mantis had chemistry, so it would be nice for them to be together.

I wanted Rocket to die in a heart-breaking way, kind 'not everyone can be saved', but Gunn did not have the balls to do it. His backstory was touching but also very predictable. The movie feels very low stake, once you realize no one can die in this.

On the positive note, I saw the movie in 4DX and some action scenes were intense! Also the jokes were funny.

"Without a doubt, the perfect closure for this run of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Really love that every character in the crew have their own roles in the movie, which is one of the things that makes this movie so good.
Rocket's backstory was so sad and adds much more to the character.
Also, when Come and Get Your Love came up during the introduction of the new Guardians of the Galaxy is a nice callback to the first time we were introduced to the OG Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014.
All in all, top 5 MCU movies for sure",2023-05-05

But high evolutionarys constant yelling was fucking hilarious.

"When Lylla and Rocket hugged in purgatory, their bodies made a heart. My cold heart melted at that.

I really like Will Poulter, and I hope his character appeals again. Adam Warlock was fun. 

It‚Äôs crazy how many crossover actors James Gunn uses in his project. No surprise that we saw his wife again (after her starring in Peacemaker). I guess if he can give them work, why not? 

This movie is the closest I‚Äôve ever gone to wanting to be a vegetarian lol. 

It‚Äôs interesting that the latest Thor and this movie had children as a central focus of the last act. Kind of a random thing to be in both films. 

The Guardians fight in the hallway gave me major Snyder vibes. Very well done.

Overall, really solid film. Happy sendoff to the franchise.",2023-05-05

"I liked it a lot. And they hit the emotional moments perfectly. Hallway sequence was very well done. But the first 2/3 had horrible pacing and editing. Felt like the story couldn‚Äôt breath, they‚Äôre entire time on Alt-Earth was a waste of time. And why was Adam Warlock in this movie? Such a waste of his character. Especially knowing that the sovereign were created by the villain, they could have written him to be more relatable to Rocket as just a test subject that wanted freedom. Should have been more of a serious character as well.",2023-05-05

"Just got back. What an amazing movie. Had my attention throughout the 2 hours and 30 minutes. Most of the Marvel movies since Endgame have been mid, but Shang Chi, Doctor Strange 2, and Guardians 3 really delivered. This one was very emotional. There were several scenes that made me want to start crying.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**My only complaints**:

1.) Hated that Star-Lord and Gamora didn't get back together. I was hoping Mantis or Nebula would somehow give her, her future version's memories.

2.) I get Star-Lord became an alcoholic, but he was always cautious heading into battle using his helmet. Could've avoided his near-death experience.

Some things even felt like very nice subversions of expectation.  Everything felt very well-fitted at the end.  I‚Äôve legitimately had a feeling of joy ever since my viewing, and I‚Äôve found that rare for anything post-Endgame.  GotG Vol. 3 feels very classic MCU.",2023-05-05

"Best Marvel movie in years. Really did a stellar job balancing the comedy and stakes, all the serious moments had time to breathe and (most of) the jokes landed pretty well. None of the Guardians dying was an actually clever way of subverting expectations and leaning into Drax's past as a father was a good direction to take his character post-Thanos. 

High Evolutionary rocked and definitely added a ton to a movie even with his limited screen time. Loved using a 2000s song at the end. Hope this ends up making money and Marvel is encouraged to keep making stuff like this going forward.",2023-05-06

"I really liked that it seemed like High Evolutionary inadvertently caused Rocket's advance development through love. It felt like through the first scenes we see of him and Rocket he is putting on a hell of a fa√ßade of actually caring about Rocket and genuinely inspiring him to think of greater things. That with his friends is what makes him special. 

And I think Adam is kind of similar in that he's very childlike and needs to be steered from his destructive destiny towards something great. Drax too literally gets to move on from being the Destroyer to being a dad to all the space kids.

The arcs of the characters just left me in a very hopeful mood. It was very pleasant.",2023-05-06

What James Gunn does best is characters, anyone showing up for mere five minutes seamlessly integrates into the rest, Mantis is the best example. She could have been a throwaway side character but after one and a half movies feels like she always was part of this. 

Everyone has a bit of an arc, everyone gets a bit of a resolution. And that in a space adventure setting that could feel goofy and without stakes. Pretty great character writing.

Though I would say in comparison to the other two because of the pretty dark back story it was a tad more unsteady tonally than either of the two previous ones.",2023-05-06

"‚ÄòThis was your story all along‚Äô

The sheer gross aspect of this movie was insanely interesting coupled with the heart wrenching moments was something I didn‚Äôt expect from any movie, let alone within the MCU. The skin planet and then hearing a young rocket say ‚Äòhurts‚Äô. The range there‚Ä¶wow. 

Props to James Gunn and completing a great trilogy even amidst the struggles of the MCU lately. I really enjoyed how this movie stood on its own and completed the story of Rocket, as well as the Guardians. Rather than, and granted sprinkled in there but not relying on other movies or characters. Rocket works as a perfect allegory for James Gunn that it made this story all the more sad. The ending with Rocket taking over felt interesting considering his DC position. Thank you for the movies and the great trilogy. 

There was something insanely heartbreaking about torturing of not only animals, but then upgrading to children that made the High Evolutionary so evil, somehow more than a guy who butchers gods.

We got a Face Off joke but no jokes about the guards being Bebop and Rock Steady. 

Tell your dogs they are good.",2023-05-06
"Never cried so much in a MCU movie. Animals fucking get me, man.

"It was really good, as is to be expected.  Definitely a lot more James Gunn than the previous ones.  Not a fan of gore and body horror, but glad this had some restraint there being a Disney film and all.  I was surprised we didn't get a John Cena cameo given all the other James Gunn crossovers.

This was probably by far the most emotional of all MCU films.  Say what you will about Tony's death, but he's got nothing on Rocket Racoon.  

The only thing I'd say comes off as a weakness, and personally I don't care, is Adam Warlock.  I'm not a comic fan, so it doesn't bother me, but I feel like a lot of comic fans could be upset by his portrayal, particularly because it was teased so early in the franchise, and what we got was essentially a baby Superman who was barely a villain at all, more of an occasional nonsequitir nuisance.   Since I had no expectations, it doesn't bother me, but I could see some people hyping him up to be a big bad villain and they'd be pretty bummed by what we got.

Loved the humor too even though a lot of the dramatic beats probably will overshadow it.  The movie had some great jokes.  Definitely a favorite for me was Drax's ""monkey noises"".",2023-05-06

"Bawled at this movie. A few things:

One, I am so glad that Gamora did change post Thanos and found a new family in Ravagers. 
     A.) I‚Äôm glad to see the other Sorcerer Supreme but would have found it hilarious if Michelle Yeoh‚Äôs Ravager just randomly showed up

Two, I loved one guy getting credited as ‚ÄúGuy Gamora Shot!‚Äù. That cracked me the fuck up.

Three, interesting that girl at the end in the Guardians is Phyla. At least that‚Äôs what she was credited as. I will be interested if she and/or Adam show up in The Marvels. 

Four, Nebula has grown so much! I‚Äôm such a proud momma vibe with her. 

Five, Mantis going on her own with the beasts makes me so happy for her. I hope she somehow comes back but if that‚Äôs her send off, I loved it.

Six, the story of Drax. I know this was Rocket‚Äôs trilogy (something stated by both Gunn and the movie), but his journey? Made me tear up too. He got his family back and didn‚Äôt have to destroy anyone (well any good guys).

Seven, Groot slowly getting Gamora to understand him? So pivotal to her story in this. And he spoke something other than ‚ÄúI am Groot‚Äù

Finally, I‚Äôm starting a class action lawsuit to Gunn for giving me way too many bawling moments with animals getting hurt. Not ok, dude, not ok.

"Loved the movie, but the flashback scenes with Rocket make me never want to watch this movie again...",2023-05-08
I just watched it today and I can‚Äôt even think about Rocket without wanting to sob. I‚Äôve always joked that every time they make a Guardians movie they‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna make these people cry so freakin hard..‚Äù but this one really got to me with all the animal abuse. Like when Rocket saw the baby raccoons and refused to let any of the animals be left behind I just lost it,2023-05-08
"Such an emotional movie and it leaves me with such an uncomfortable feeling thinking about Floor, Teef and Lyla and what they were subjected to too. The most glaring thing in this movie for me would be that it seems James Gunn completely ignored the vacuum of space. Like when the hellspawn crack open Knowhere or Adam crashes through the cockpit of the ship Peter and Gamora are on.",2023-05-08

Man that scene where Rocket gets pulled out of the afterlife gave me some Kakashi flashbacks.,2023-05-08
"I really enjoyed it. All of Rocket's flashbacks were thoroughly engrossing. I got some real Secret of NIMH vibes. 

I thought the plot became a little too unwieldy after Rocket finally woke up. The whole part where Mantis, Drax, and Nebula get trapped on the ship just felt like a way to postpone the ending more. Adam Warlock was underutilized and wasn't really given much to do. I have to wonder how this movie might have looked without the James Gunn firing + rehiring/Infinity War/Endgame disrupting Gunn's writing. Seemed like he had a lot of loose ends to fit together, but despite that he did a fine job. Certainly many of the best action scenes from the series can be found here. 

Where was the f-bomb? I never noticed it, but I've since heard it was the first f-bomb in a Marvel movie.",2023-05-08
"I honestly thought the last two movies were good and this one was no different. Full of laughs, emotion, and action. Third best marvel collection of movies to date behind avengers and Captain America.",2023-05-08

"This movie being a sendoff for the GOTG had me going in expecting someone to die. I know Bautista hates all the makeup and wanted out. Every time Drax got injured I held my breath in shock then was surprised when he stood up. I'm glad none of the Guardians died in this movie. It was a great ending for each of them. 

I'm surprised after the movie when >!it said that StarLord would return. I thought Chris Pratt would retire from Marvel too like RDJ and Chris Evans.!<",2023-05-08

"Is it just me, or is that Rocket near death experience very similar to Deadpool 2?  I wonder if Deadpool 3 is going to bring that up...",2023-05-09
"I love how Mantis stood up for herself and wanted to find a path for her. The animal cruelty hit so hard omfg it was killing me. Glad that prick got what he deserved. I love how everyone was trying to grow and be something better. Nebula wanted to give others what they couldn‚Äôt have before. I just enjoyed the themes of loving yourself, family always and forever, and not doing what is easy, but what is right. Cried my eyes out and it was just brilliant imo. 
P.S. I liked warlock but I feel they didn‚Äôt really give him a lot of context or backstory. Just that he had to capture rocket, then sadly his mom died, he saves Peter, and boom joins the team. I would‚Äôve liked a bit more from his character.",2023-05-09
Adam Warlock was hilarious lol.,2023-05-10
"Pretty good movie, a little long, could be trimmed down a little. The effects were phenomenal and there's just so much creativity in costumes and alien designs.

The movie was amazing. Mad feels all the way through!,2023-05-11
"Loved the movie, I can also report that it's being review bombed mildly, with word for word reviews with generic named accounts rating it 0-3/10. I dunno why? All I can think is that some weird snyderverse fans are mad that DC is doing a reboot so they sre shitting on the James Gunn movie.",2023-05-11
"I really liked that it's the 2nd Guardians film to dodge the typical Marvel formula of the villain being just a bigger, badder, version of the hero.

They slipped back into that with 2, but 1 and now 3 have unique villains, disconnected from the heroes, with their own motivations.

A real rarity for Marvel, good to see it!",2023-05-12

"Compared to Gamora and Drax with all their heavy makeup definitely but that scream he laid out when Lila was shot and Floor was having a panic attack screeching ""Rocket, Teef, Floor GO NOW"" while Rocket is screaming (in a way we have never heard before) and the villain mocks him as well! That was an emotionally charged scene, I would say he worked hard for it",2023-05-15
Loved it,2023-05-15

I would like to mention the actors/actresses screams in this movie. Mantis when she sees Quill floating in space, fearing her brother has died right in front of her, Quill screaming when Rocket flatlines....they were CHILLING screams. I don't think I can rewatch this one for a while...it really tugs on the heartstrings.",2023-05-16

I‚Äôm interested to see where it goes from here without Gunn and with a new crew of guardians but I hope for the best as I genuinely love this trilogy with my whole heart",2023-05-17

"I loved this movie, great send off to the characters and the best Marvel movie I‚Äôve seen in a while, but I‚Äôm not sure if I can sit through the scenes with the animals again, that shit was traumatic. Just thinking about that poor bunny is upsetting.",2023-05-20
Wheres the fuckin movies,2023-05-21
"I set myself up before even going to see this movie under the expectation that either rocket or drax were going to die, given they had been through the most painful experiences. As soon as the movie started with the music following rocket, it set the tone unbelievably well and I totally believed rocket was going to die. Then when he immediately got attacked and was bleeding everywhere I was sort of put into a state of shock that he was dying so soon. I can‚Äôt actually believe how many moments there were when I expected someone to die. Rocket at the start, Drax when he was shot badly in the orgoscope, Rocket again when he actually died, Mantis when she confronted the Basilisk (I guess this one was least likely), Peter at the end and hell I even thought Nebula might die when she decided to drive the HE‚Äôs ship to help everyone off. 

After reading some of these comments it‚Äôs reminded me of so much that happened in it, and I think I need to see it again to fully appreciate the absolute rollercoaster this films takes us through. It is actually a masterpiece with subtle tones of strong relationships between different and perhaps unexpected pairs of characters, a 100% evil villain, a redemption story for warlock and closure for every character which actually makes sense. Only thing I‚Äôm not totally convinced on is why Nebula stuck with the children, although I suppose throughout the MCU she has done a complete 180 in terms of how she behaves going from being full of hatred in GotG1 to wanting to take care of kids by the end of GotG3.",2023-05-21

"I‚Äôve been burnt out from the Marvel films, but came to this one when friends asked. I did like it, and I don‚Äôt really have anything like negative to really say? Although I wish there was just one more film left with the entire cast but I guess since Gunn is focusing on other projects they also want to hang up the coat, and I can‚Äôt fault them for it.

Either way I liked it, my friends like it.",2023-05-24
"I'm so late but I showed up high to the theater and sobered up very quickly in the beginning (like Peter). I didn't watch any trailers but was curious why parents were so upset, I more so understand the parents now. It definitely is its rating but holy shit that beginning had me half covering my eyes. what a great movie

Edit (though I doubt people will see this): did anyone else think Gamora was going to die? I did but mainly thought about it when the little furry pet got attached to her and before we knew Adam wasn't dead. I thought that each character the animal got attached to died and was like ahh shit",2023-05-27

"Could someone give something to read on the topic of long-shots? Namely, how they plan and (and maybe execute) scenes like the one where the Guardians fight the monsters and minions together? When Drax opens the doors and there is a wave of enemies coming. There is a lot of choreographed movement on the screen, as a starting writer I am just wondering how this is planned ahead in time, what will be on the screen on every given second and what goes to the front, what to the background, etc.",2023-05-29

"I did not like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 - and I loved the previous 2. Gunn strayed off brand, interrupted the world he'd created with horror elements that did not mix with the GoG cannon, at all. It was like a fucked up commercial that distracts you from the main plot. Sure, I like a good back story like anyone as far as how Rocket became Rocket - however the direction they took it was super messed up and ruined the movie. I loved the comedic moments, the bad dog jokes were hilarious and Drax ""You think I'm stupid?"" and many more. Chukwudi Iwuji did an amazing job as the super villain. Adam Warlock - 0 backstory? I would have hoped at least a freakin 30 sec clip explained who he was in more detail, the world he came from, how he has powers etc. The post credits scene was pretty lame as well. But above all, walking out of the theater last night, I just felt unsettled and annoyed by the metal arms and spider bodies of the fucked up experimented animals & the minions that worked for the High Evolutionary. It destroyed what was enjoyable about the movie and took it away from being good for kids to watch. That campy, good natured vibe - that is missing from so much of cinema in a sincere way, not the fake Disney movie way - with 80s nostalgia really set Guardians to a new level and why they became a fav. Now, the intrusive horror vibe made it distasteful, copy and pasted in, and made it hard to fully enjoy any of the pieces that did work well for the film. I didn't go to see Black Mirror! Very disappointed. Hopefully in the next film Gunn can recover from this misstep.",2023-06-03

"Idk if it's MCU fatigue or the fact that the rest of the MCU has drifted towards the style of the Guardians movies but this did very little for me

Rocket's backstory was interesting but also felt drawn out, Drax and Mantis had some good lines but no one else did. Overall I was pretty bored. The villains and the action felt generic, actor's performances were dull. It felt like everyone involved in the production was just going through the motions

Honestly think I had more fun laughing at Antman 3, that was so incredibly bad it ended up being a pretty funny evening. This was just... meh",2023-06-14
"So I haven't seen anyone mention the music.

1) I didn't know some of the songs chosen so I don't think this soundtrack is as good as the previous efforts.

2) It was too invasive. I feel like Peter wouldn't have music blaring while he's on a job with his friends bc he needs to be able to communicate with them. It was just too obvious that they were trying to keep up the ""we have the best soundtracks in the MCU"" game. (Psst, take a listen to Captain Marvel's 90s soundtrack sometime. It's fantastic.)",2023-06-17
"I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I was pretty apprehensive about it after Thor and Ant-man ended up being duds (which was extra disappointing since I enjoyed Ragnarok and the previous 2 Ant-man films). Thank goodness Guardians actually turned out to be pretty good. The balance between the comedy and serious moments were well handled unlike some of the other entries in the MCU. I like that Star Lord gets to be cool again after having been relegated to less flattering showing in previous MCU appearances.

I was indifferent but now I'm looking forward to how Gunn will handle DCU.",2023-06-25
Best MCU film I've seen in quite awhile. Super hero fatigue is real but this hit the spot. Probably in my top tier of MCU movies.,2023-07-08
"Just watched and I really enjoyed it.

I do feel there is a bit too much comedy, but the horror in this film evened it out in the end.

IT WAS SO FUCKING SAD. Rocket;s backstory felt like I was watching a live-action anime. I don't think I could watch it again because it was a lot to take in, personally, way future.

I have no idea the direction the MCU is going in, it's difficult to create new+fresh dilemmas constantly, the story and dialogue has to be A1 with repeating events.

I know for a fact they knew to use ""We are family"", I don't know why they didn't. The pop culture statement would have made it unforgettable.",2023-07-08

"I love guardians of the galaxy, all of them are good this was I liked but idk I can‚Äôt handle animal abuse so It was hard to watch in the beginning I cried a little bit",2023-08-03
"I finally caught it last night on Disney+. I had seen all this hype (or whatever you call retroactive hype, praise I guess?) for the High Evolutionary as an all time great MCU villain and I just wasn‚Äôt feeling that. He was obviously despicable to the extreme in ways that only the completely dead inside can‚Äôt emotionally engage with but beyond the animal abuse I found him very one note. He just yelled and screamed and preened. Whatever. 

Having said that, this is easily my favorite of the Guardians flicks. Everything else besides the villain worked so well for me. It was both the funniest and most brutal of the series and I really appreciated the finesse it took to pull that off. The soundtrack was great, the character growth and development were excellent, and I overall just had a great time. A great send-off for the Guardians. I think the most affecting moment for me was seeing Gamora back with the Ravagers. I immediately realized that she was with her chosen family who were not the Guardians and I thought that was a beautiful and subversive thing to show. 

Good stuff! More like this, please, Marvel Studios!!!!",2023-08-03

This movie is great so far but what's up with Nebula and Gamora's makeup? And what's with Nebula's voice? Why is she screaming every line and why does she sound kinda like Cookie Monster? Karen Gillan is usually a great actress bur she just seems off in this movie.,2023-08-18
"Guardians of the galaxy 3 hit me hard because i grew up with the trilogy. I was 11 when GOTG 1 Vale out 2014. Now i am 20 and the ending was like a closure for my childhood. Every time a GOTG was released I was going through though stages of my life. This movie not only ended a trilogy but a era of my life. I think this may will be my last marvel movie I watch. 

It also made me feel hope again for the future. 

Farewell guardians, we had a good time‚Ä¶..",2023-09-04
"I guess everyone has nothing but positives to say about this movie but I found the ending really unsatisfying. The whole point of the movie felt like it was about friendship and the new family all these ragtag individuals had created. Peter spends the whole movie desperate to save rocket. Then no emotional conversation between the two of them after they save him. And it‚Äôs see ya I‚Äôm heading back to earth and done with the guardians of the galaxy. It just felt so sudden and for all the happy emotions they made between all these characters they didn‚Äôt do a great job with Peter and Rocket at the end. They should have had Peter saying to rocket that he‚Äôll always be his best friend or something at least to show that he‚Äôs not leaving to hurt his friend or they‚Äôll always be friends or something.
Also Gamora‚Äôs character is inconsistent with even old gamora. Sure she didn‚Äôt have the same events happen for her to fall in love with Peter. I get that. But in guardians 1 before she loved him she was the one who was trying to stop the Kree from killing an entire planet. Now she doesn‚Äôt care about anyone. It just didn‚Äôt feel at all consistent with her old character even.",2023-09-05

"I don't know how to rate this movie.

on one hand the Rocket and Peter/Gamora storylines are great on the other hand the movie is full of lazy writing and forced conclusions to characters arcs.

it's like they realised everyone needed a conclusion to their arc so they just tacked on a bunch of weaker material to the main storyline, e.g.

Drax needed a reason to become a dad again, Oh look at that he finds a bunch of caged children in the final act to save!

Adam Warlock needed to be good by the end of the movie, oh look he randomly faints when confronting the Guardians at the end and they save him just in time for him to have a change of heart and save Peter when he's stuck in space!

Mantis needs to stand up for herself, oh look here's a scene where Nebula is being mena to Drax, now Mantis can show she has a spine!

none of these were bad ideas it just seemed forced like they were working their way through a checklist when filming this movie and couldn't think of a better way to weave these storyline with the A plot.",2023-05-08
"Just watched it on D+. This was not a good movie. It was the weakest of the 3 by a wide margin. Very weak script, scenes were all over the place, serious pacing issues, went 30 mins too long, forced and unfunny jokes, one-note characters across the board, except for Rocket. I was particularly offended by the sappy, overwrought pretentious, shallow emphasis on giving the tortured animals cliched lines like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have friends,‚Äù or their plans for the future before obviously killing them for purely manipulative emotional effect. It‚Äôs like what a 12 year old would put together to try to make other little kids cry. It was childish and unearned. What an immature movie. And that script definitely needed another few turns. All of the humor involved characters shouting at each other. No differentiation in tone or delivery or personality. All the lines could have been said by the same person. Finally the music was also forced and awkward and would just drag on and on without fitting the tone of the scene. Just not a good film.",2023-08-06
"Well shit that was miles better than vol 2 in about every way. The darker themes and moments were handled perfectly, don't understand the tonal complaints from the critics.

"Surprisingly, I think people are underselling this a little because of recent marvel projects. 

This is a really, really, really good movie. Super tight script where there isn‚Äôt really much fat and it‚Äôs also hitting all of the emotional beats. Incredible pacing, no wasted moments and the flashbacks for rocket are well spaced. Dialogue is very funny (for my sense of humor anyway). Excellent use of marvels first ‚Äúfuck‚Äù. Not enough can be said about where all these characters end up. I don‚Äôt think any of these characters have an unsatisfying or inappropriate ending. I think it‚Äôs absolutely worth touching on how effective the flashbacks in this movie are. The villain barely interacts with the main cast and you still feel his presence despite that. 

If I had to pick one criticism - Will Poulter is under utilized. His fight scene to start the movie was incredibly dynamic and one of the best offerings from marvel, plus he was very funny. Looking forward to more Adam warlock.",2023-05-06
"Yo this was good. I kept thinking ""if Thor Love & Thunder was made like this it would've been epic""

I especially loved the fight scene with all the Guardians. They also weren't afraid to be a bit more graphic than the typical Marvel movie (e.g. Nebula being disfigured, beheaded pig, etc.)

james gunn style direction - nostalgic 90's music + floating through space or dramatic nonsensical action montage. rinse and repeat until the movie just sort of ends. overall good film that is driven by the characters we've invested in all this time.,2023-05-10
"Not a single thing in this movie hit for me. They were clearly trying to make me care about multiple things and none of it landed. They felt more disconnected as a group than they did in the first movie. And even if they were trying to levy that into the idea that it was time they parted ways, it didn't feel earned. I just didn't care about any of the characters anymore. And too many random pointless cameos that just takes away from the escapism.",2023-05-08

Good F-bomb placement, excellent hallway action scene and felt for Rocket‚Äôs story, I just can‚Äôt see myself liking this better than GotG 1?

"Am I imagining a plot point here or can someone back me up please.

In my head I definitely remember someone in the film saying that Gamora ""Doesn't remember"" her time with the guardians. And at the end of Endgame/Thor 4 this 'past-gamora' is WITH the guardians. So somewhere between then and now they've had a falling out and she's left, then joined the ravagers.

AND we see Mantis wipe Draxs' memory when he's upset about being called stupid... can you see where I'm going here?

Did something big happen between films and Gamora asked Mantis to erase her memory of them?",2023-05-05
"my thoughts:

-this is the best MCU movie since EndGame

-i was initially skeptical about Wil Poulter as Adam Warlock, but now i can undoubtedly say he was perfectly cast for that role

-this movie was so much fun. not many moments/plot points i can poke holes in

-james gunn is the best comic movie writer/director at the moment and needs to be given as much money as he wants for future projects",2023-05-05

"For me, this was a hit and miss.

I don't get why everyone is angrily yelling at each other for the first half of the movie and I felt it leaned a bit too much into the ""kick a dog"" trope to tug on our heartstrings and make us hate the villain.

A lot of the jokes surprisingly did not land, making the Guardians seem like assholes. The pacing is odd, it goes from zero to 100 almost immediately. 

I was impressed by all the body horror, though. Some of it is genuinely creepy.

I feel the film maybe tried too much to get away from the vibe started in the first film and then subsequently copied to all too many Marvel films.",2023-05-05

"I was really looking forward to this after reading some reviews and I think they got me too hyped. I thought it was good, but it didn't blow me away like most reviewers were claiming it would. Honestly, I left blue balled. We got all this build it up to this being the end of the Guardians and then not a single one dies. It really seems like the MCU is too scared to off main characters now. At least it wasn't as bad as Antman where they're fighting the new big bad that's killed hundreds of Avengers and yet he can't handle ants.    
    
One main gripe though is at the end when Groot speaks, I wish he said:

"I thought it was solid. I feel like the problems I have with the movie are the same problems I have with other Marvel movies, which I admit I‚Äôm not a fan of.

One thing I‚Äôll say is that Rocket‚Äôs emotional core of the film is extremely effective and makes up for a lot it‚Äôs issues.

I genuinely can‚Äôt stand Nebula. Idk what it is, I find her so annoying her lines suck, and Karen Gillen just isn‚Äôt a great actress.

I don‚Äôt really see *why* Gammorah couldn‚Äôt remember Quill. Quill even mentioned it was ‚Äúinfinity stone scienc-y‚Äù mumbo-jumbo. But like if that‚Äôs the case, then after she died and came back the exact same ‚Äúinfinity stone scienc-y‚Äù mumbo-jumbo could have made it work too. Idk

The whole thing plot-wise feels completely contrived, but they honestly all are, so that‚Äôs not really a huge hit on it.

Overall I liked it, I just struggle to look past the glaring laziness of the writing and truly awful tone management and dialogue.",2023-05-08
"It was pretty good.

I am not a Marvel person but I really enjoyed the first Guardians of the Galaxy as it had interesting and fun characters throughout. The second one had some cool moments but overall I thought it was meh. This third installment is better than the second one and definitely better than the previous Marvel films.

I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of James Gunn‚Äôs filmography but his work on the Guardians of the Galaxy and The Suicide Squad were pretty good and fits his type of style and direction including this one. The special effects were colorful and had some pretty good designs, moments with action or fight scenes were well-executed and fun to observe. With the previous films having a 70s and 80s like soundtrack, the soundtrack here has some cool bangers and adds energy to the atmosphere. There are also some pretty cool camerawork throughout.

The performances from the cast members were all great as each cast had good chemistry and energy to work together as a team. I appreciate the film approaching new elements on emotions and dark aspects which I thought were creative and worked pretty well with the narrative. For characters, it‚Äôs fun to see the main crew interact and continue to explore their purposes. Some of the new characters introduced were interesting although not as fun or interesting as the main leads. There were some decent dialogue throughout and the humor aspects were good but some really didn't land well.

But overall, the film was still pretty good as it carries fun characters and a good sense of humor. Definitely one of the best films from this phase.

Groot saying ""I Love You Guys"" was honestly sweet.

"The Rocket movie wrapped inside the cliche MCU film was quite good.  Gonna get a 4/10 from me; way too long, everybody is just yelling the entire time, and they do the same story beats since the first film.  Even the scene in the organic prison was almost exactly the same as the original prison scene instead of turning off gravity he makes all their suits go crazy.  The stuff with Rocket was fanatastic tear jerking.  The rest of the movie was standard MCU cookie cutter but at least Cosmo was a good dog.",2023-05-22
"I went home and hugged all my pets.

There's a lot to love about it ‚Äî it's genuinely emotional, laugh out loud funny, has an incredible action sequence (Beastie Boys), some truly inventive set pieces, and a cathartic conclusion to much of the GOTG arcs...

...but it's so noticeably shaggy and uneven throughout. The plot is overstuffed, the villain isn't as interesting as the movie pretends he is, and they couldn't resist the urge to add in an unfortunate amount of CGI goop in the final act.

Which is a shame because there's a top-tier MCU movie in there that gets somewhat cannibalized by its shortcomings and ends up being fine/pretty good.",2023-05-05
"This was okay. I enjoyed it more in the beginning than nearer to the end. It starts to drag, and it feels like there isn't as much humor late in the film.

"I just got out of seeing it, and I am probably going to get downvoted, but I did not think it was nearly as good as everyone is saying. It felt very uneven, some of the acting was really bad throughout, and this one probably had the worst writing out of all three movies. The only thing that was superior about this one was the flashback scenes. The flashbacks to Rocket and his friends was beautiful and sad and tragic. Some of the action scenes were fun but long. The film felt over long. Also, they made Mantis way too over the top camp and cartoonish in both the Christmas special and this. 

I see people putting this one in their top 5 or 10, and while I respect your opinions, I disagree. I actually think it‚Äôs weird people hate on Eternals so much but are loving this. Eternals was a much better made film than this.",2023-05-05

"I'd say it was about as good as *Volume 2*, but *Volume 1* is still the best of the trilogy by a long shot. *Volume 1* felt like a bit of a love letter to science fiction, like it was the kind of film people were hoping or expecting that *The Force Awakens* would be. But something was missing from *Volume 3*, as if Gunn was leaning a little too hard on the campy 1980s science fiction aesthetic. Some of the costume designs -- especially during the Orgocorp scenes -- were very obviously people in silly costumes and makeup. Even with Nathan Fillion chewing the scenery, the film just couldn't get out of its own way.

Usually flashbacks can be used to give context behind characters actions by showing the memories they're thinking about while doing things, but rocket didn't do anything for most of the movie.

The F bomb was a total shock!,2023-05-07
"Still making up my mind about this one. Great visuals, action sequences (although the 360 degree rotation around characters standing back to back is way overdone by now), and one-liners. The animal lab abuse was just insanely brutal and honestly a little cheap to pull at the heartstrings. Reminds me a bit of Avatar 2, with >!the calf crying out for its mother after the whalers kill her!<. If this kind of stuff helps sway people away from eating meat or laboratory tested products, I'm all for it, but man this stuff can be traumatizing for little kids.

I thought the main villain High Evolutionary was fantastic. Seemed as though he was modeled directly from Adolf himself. Use of eugenics to create the ""master race,"" delusions of grandeur and striving to replace/become God, and even tangential references to the Holocaust (kids in concentration-camp like pens, ""Incinerate them!""). I was a bit lost with Warlock's plot line, but I've only seen the first two Guardians movies once. His arc seemed a bit odd and not very organic. Sean Gunn's presence was also very distracting and every time he was on screen, all I could think was how silly it is to cast your family in enormous roles when much better actors should have been used.

Lots of death fake-outs too, which I didn't really mind, since I don't want to see any of those characters die. It was already an emotional rollercoaster, so that would have just been a step too far toward the dark side. Lastly, what's up with Rocket's animal friends still being all f'd up and modified in Heaven? Shouldn't they have been reverted to their original forms? Seemed like a strange choice to keep their bodies all mangled when the usual trope has people being healed from whatever their ailment was. Also, the ""Your time will come...but not yet"" cliche needs to go away. Best line of the film: ""Open the fucking door!""

Overall, I think I'd give it a 7.5, borderline 8/10. Enjoyable, but the mediocrity of phase 4 and 5 so far gives it a bump. I'll look forward to Starlord's ""life on Earth"" standalone film.",2023-05-07

Probably my favorite of the Guardians franchise and top 3 in the MCU overall. One of the things I haven‚Äôt seen discussed is there isn‚Äôt any use of the usual MCU joke structure of undercutting a serious moment with a joke. There were so many times in an emotional moment where I was getting ready to roll my eyes at a joke coming at the end of it, but that never happened. They let the serious moments be serious and the funny moments be funny, and it‚Äôs all the better for it.

First of all the villain. You have absolutely no understanding, why he is the person that he is. He wants to perfect the Universe. That's it. Compared to Thanos he practically has no story arc. And seemed wasted. 
Next Adam Warlock. He is.only in the story so he is introduced to the MCU. He is practically not needed fir the story. Why is he There? What's his motivation? Or the motivation of his people? Where does  he come from? Nothing.

"My biggest criticism of this film isn‚Äôt even this films fault

But the lack of Peter and Gamora‚Äôs romance, especially after the first two films, really glared and this film made me realise how much I liked the pairing and how much I missed it and as a result, this film made me wish they hadn‚Äôt killed off prime Gamora in Infinity War because when Peter and 2014 Gamora go their separate ways, it felt like an unsatisfying ending to their story together.

I dunno, call me a sucker for a happy ending but I would‚Äôve preferred to see Peter and Gamora get their happy ending. Prime Gamora didn‚Äôt get her happy ending, instead she just got killed by her abusive adoptive father and as a result, Peter was forced to move on which didn‚Äôt really feel like a happy ending for him either. Yeah, I know not everyone gets a happy ending but considering all those two had been through and lost, I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve been too much to ask for them to get a happy ending together. I mean we saw Peter lose his mother, then we saw him find out his birth father was a ***dick*** right before he loses his adoptive father and then he loses his girlfriend and with Gamora, we saw her lose her people, we saw the results of Thanos‚Äô abuse and once she finally gets away from him and finds a family, she‚Äôs killed by him, so is it too much to ask for those two to get a happy ending together?

In regards to 2014 Gamora, i understand why Gunn went the direction he did but I think if done well, Peter and 2014 beginning a romance could‚Äôve worked because sure, this new Gamora isn‚Äôt the same Gamora he fell in love with in 2014 but at the same time, he‚Äôs not the same Peter he was in 2014. They‚Äôre both different now and I think it could‚Äôve worked, especially because I‚Äôd trust Gunn to write it in a way that could‚Äôve worked. They wouldn‚Äôt even need to get ‚Äòtogether‚Äô in the film, they could‚Äôve just hinted at it. 

I dunno, maybe it‚Äôs just me.",2023-05-09
"Biggest issue with the movie to me was Gamora, it felt like they opted out of a grieving plot and instead went with an ""exes learn they can't reconcile"" plot while still keeping the grieving angle and both were done an disservice in the process. Gamora is also such a terrible person in this with so few scenes that I did not care how her plot ended (which also made no sense because she was brought from like a month before the events of GotG 1 and it was explicit in that one that she had the most moral backbone on the team, Peter *even says so verbatim in this one*. The idea that she'd revert to being a sadistic sociopath just because she was plucked from her timeline like a month early is ridiculous.) Overall, wish that she'd been left out entirely or even died permanently (again) in Endgame.",2023-05-05

This trilogy has always been about Rocket, so seeing his story get the focus was great. That hallway fight set to Beastie Boys goes fuckin hard and was amazing, just action so well choreographed in a big budget MCU movie. I love everyones arc, the best villain in any of the GotG movies and probably up there with Namor as the best of the post Thanos phases.

Thanos wasn't as petty or cruel (they went out of their way to have Nebula even say that not even Thanos tortured her to this extent) or have a god complex as this guy does, and man I did feel like he got off a little easy.

I‚Äôll give myself a week or two. Rocket‚Äôs backstory was freaking heartbreaking. Don‚Äôt know if I wanna go through that again, but hats off to James Gunn for bringing the drama and not holding back. The bonds he developed with the other animals while in captivity was bittersweet. You simply didn‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to them, but the film went there.

One scene I don't see mentioned much was when they were breaking into that organic corporation and quill is having this heart to heart with gamora... Only to be interrupted by mantis telling him they can all hear them. And the.

"Great movie, definitely bogged down at the beginning with Marvel's signature 45 Minutes of Expository Catch-up‚Ñ¢ but once it got past that it was a very funny, surprisingly heartwrenching movie that's dripping with actual personality, which feels illegal for marvel movies nowadays.


It feels like Marvel saw The Suicide Squad, realized that sort of thing was possible, and then let James Gunn go buck wild in Vol. 3 in ways they never would've allowed in the first two. Kind of makes me bummed that we probably won't be seeing any more Gunn-helmed Marvel movies. I want that Howard the Duck movie, god damnit",2023-05-10

I loved nearly every moment I cried so many times it was honestly heartbreaking and hilarious at the same time. Every part of rockets backstory broke my heart and even though we knew it was coming i still had hope his friends had survived :( (so naive). Mantis and Drax constantly had me laughing I love their relationship I cried with drax as he said bye to Mantis, Nebulas character has had one of the greatest developments (next to mantis) she‚Äôs got such dry remarks that i found hilarious. Im glad they didn‚Äôt bring Quill and Gamora back together that would of being so forced, she hasn‚Äôt gone through everything old gamora went through to make her fall for quill and it‚Äôs nice to see shes got a family with the ravengers and i feel like stallones character is the father figure she‚Äôs always wanted. Cosmo was such a cute character the perfect doggo love that she was a big part of the film. I love that rocket got closure from the guilt he was feeling for all these years. I love adam warlocks character I know some people didn‚Äôt but i think it was done perfectly he‚Äôs not living to his full potential yet cause hes just a kid he just does what he does for his mum. When he disintegrated that guy i was in stitches it was so funny and nathan fillions character was quite funny.

Abusing animals even CGI ones always elicits a strong emotion from me. I'm glad not too long after that scene they had Drax doing the monkey noises it really helped.

I was definitely expecting Rocket to die in this film, the trailers and the vibe from Gunn certainly gave that impression. As soon as he was revived mid way through I knew it wasn't gonna end with him dyeing a second time which was a good choice it was a less predictable ending to have them all just decide to move on from the team.",2023-05-05

"Really liked it for the most part. Felt good to see an MCU movie with actual character development for a change. 

Gunn‚Äôs handling of superhero action choreography is best in-class. Would have loved for him to do an Avengers movie eventually. Oh well. 

The animal abuse was overdone imo, and Rocket‚Äôs backstory was kinda overlong/took him away from the core crew for a long time. There weren‚Äôt many meaningful interactions between Rocket and the rest of the Guardians after he came back, which is a shame considering that this is maybe one of the last times this iteration of the crew comes together on screen. 

High Evolutionary was just comically bad. I mean, I get that I am supposed to hate him, mission accomplished. But I just wanted every scene with him to end as soon as it began.

That Florence + Machine needle drop tho. Bawled my eyes out. Gunn‚Äôs best soundtrack in the whole trilogy. 

Overall,  some of the most emotionally resonant content MCU has churned out, and serves as a fitting swan song for these weirdos.",2023-05-06

Not that those things were bad, they just pale in comparison to the Guardian stuff for me.

I expect the DC films to be better, but they won't reach the heights of anything like this, and all I can see is wasted potential. Especially in light of how disappointing this current phase has been.

God, as much as I love this film, I can't help but feel extremely frustrated and disappointed that I'm not going to get something like this again.",2023-05-07

"Really enjoyed it.  My thoughts:

&#x200B;

It truly was an emotional roller coaster.  Back stories galore.  Each character had their arc and yet there wasn't a total ""everything's perfect in the end"" kind of feel...to me the best movies out there.  Rocket's backstory was absolute top-notch writing.  

&#x200B;

There were times were I thought the sfx were not quite up to snuff - like in the tissue base.  At Marvel's level I want the best, and I could tell some of those effects were not 100%.  

&#x200B;

The last song I feel wasn't the original last song.  I felt they were dancing to something else but then couldn't get the rights or something.  

&#x200B;

Agree 10000% on the ""I love you guys"" bringing the audience into the guardians...I even kinda heard ""I am groot"" anyways.  Beautifully done.

The movie is really bad.,2023-07-13
"It was a great movie, full of emotional moments, I loved rocket backstory and all the heartfelt moments. But to be frank, I don't think Vol. 3 fit that well with the narrative the movies were going for in Vol. 1 and 2. I always thought that the movies were mostly about Peter and his relationship with his own past, the stuff that he wants to forget about/feels guilty about (with his mother) and the part he yearns and desperately looks for to feel validated, to feel important, go finally feel good with himself (with his father).

I thought Vol. 3 would show us Peter coming back to earth and what that meant for him, coming full circle and finally facing his trauma. Instead Vol. 3 kinda just turn into a Rocket movie and I'm not saying it was bad, it was actually the best part of the movie IMO, but it just feels like the general story took a side turn all of a sudden. 

I also feel like old Gamora should have been there. Their relationship was kind of the emotional core of Peter's arc and, in a way, of the movies. They were sort of the mom and dad of the group. I know that wasn't Gunn's decision, but It feels like there's something important missing. At least the movie addresses it kinda good and doesn't make the fan service move of bringing old Gamora back and actually commits with her death, giving her a good send-off.",2023-05-11

"Where to start? 

I felt that some of the gags were misplaced, causing the tone to feel uneven at times. It also had some predictable beats at the end (Warlock saving Quill, Cosmos being a good dog, ""But not yet""). And I found it odd that Groot seemed to not have as much of a reaction to Rocket being near death as the others. 

But with that said, WOW. The best MCU film in a good while. So much emotion and heart in this one. So relieved that the Guardians all survived. Rockets backstory, while horrific, was beautifully done. The introduction to Batch 89 reminded me of Syd's toys in Toy Story. 

The hallway sequence is one of the best action sequences in the all the MCU. Seeing the team work so well together after their earlier dysfunction was great to see.  

I said it was predictable but damn it, Cosmos is a good dog. 

Probably could go on for a bit on all the great moments in this film. Will rewatch soon.

Very sad for Peter after watching this movie. It was a good movie! He just suffered so much loss. He always wanted to ""find his family""

SPOILER BELOW

Here are my observations. Rocket's backstory (very sad) is connected to Gamora's murder. The High Evolutionary was at the mountain when Gamora was murdered by Thanos. They made it a point in the movie for Gamora to take his mask off.

What did the High Evolutionary do to those children. I believe one of those children rescued could be Gamora and Peter's child. Repeat of Peter and Gamora's tragic childhood -broken families are always so sad.",2023-05-05

There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre never seeing each other again. Peter can come visit Rocket and Knowhete anytime and viceversa. Mantis will probably return from her solo trip in a year or two and Gamora is still in contact with Nebula/Knowhere. 

It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre never gonna see each other again‚Ä¶..",2023-05-07
"Man I was not expecting such an amazing movie. I knew it would be good, but not *that* good. They nailed everything. Closing every arch beautifully. Adding just the right amount of humour, while taking themselves serious enough to acknowledge that it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust another superhero movie‚Äù‚Ä¶ Also loved the little bit of Poulter‚Äôs character that we saw, and look forward to seeing more. Rocket makes a great captain, and if I never saw any of those characters on screen again, I would still be satisfied.",2023-05-07

"Saw it tonight. Probably the single best Marvel movie since‚Ä¶. Oof, genuinely hard to think of worn that had is all in the way this one did. 

James Gunn moving to DC is a big loss for Marvel, and if the WB bosses stay out of his way, DC could actually be really good!",2023-05-10
"*After all is said and done, can we agree this movie kicks ass?!*

That was fucking beautiful, and I mean it. After the second movie and the current state of the MCU for some time now, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I was thoroughly entertained. I laughed, I cried, I was horrified, surprised by how dark is got for an MCU film, but at the end of it all I was left smiling. The humor wasn't too overbearing, the action was great, the music was on point, and I love it. And they actually referenced ""God reaching out to Adam"", with Peter and Adam at the end, Jesus! This movie reminded me why I love Florence and The Machine. Haven't smiled that much in a while.

""*Word."" -* Rocket Raccoon

&#x200B;

But with that said I do have a few questions like Why the hell at the very end Get the high evolutionary seems so weak At the beginning he is almost crushing Adam to death but then he forgets he can Control gravity? What? And he can create highly advanced civilizations using primative lifeforms, give himself superpowers, but he can't just grow a new face? Really? And what happened to him afterwards at the end? Did they just leave them there on the floor? I could've sworn I saw Drax carrying him across his shoulders...

And was that the FIRST use of the F word in the MCU movies?!",2023-05-12

"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The first one is great, but the second one is at the bottom of my MCU list. It's hot garbage. But I thought this was solid. It redeems some of the character choices of the second one a little bit, with Mantis yelling at Nebula about Drax. It's incredibly emotional, Rocket's near-death experience is the first time a Marvel film has made me misty-eyed. And Chris Pratt did a better job when handed an emotional scene. I was much more convinced by his grief over Rocket than I was by his grief over Yondu. I'm a fan of both Adam Warlock and the High Evolutionary from the comics, so I'm torn over both their adaptations but the portrayals were good nonetheless. Phyla, on the other hand... No thanks. Didn't like that one at all. The music choices weren't bad, but they weren't as well-integrated as the other films. I've already said way more than I intended when I started this comment, so I'll wrap it up by saying it was good and I liked it.",2023-05-05

Some mentioned it as the best since End Game. That might be too much but it‚Äôs a GREAT movie. James Gunn does not miss at all. It is a movie with a great background story around Rocket, probably my fav character of them, highly emotional and written so well.

The fights were awesomely shot, the music was amazing and the duration did not hinder me at all. I won‚Äôt go to much into detail to prevent spoilers, but it had funny oneliners, some cool new or funny characters and the emotional aspect of Rocket‚Äôs past touched me.

Guardians for most people is considered as third rate and a side commedic group. Hell I loved Guardians since it's debut. Something about it just works with it's balance of it's characters, action and comedy. Like even Thor movies tries comedy but it feels kinda lame. Spiderman has it's dorky comedic moments. But Guardians has just the right balance. 

I guess the diversity as a group really works because each character is has clear written quirks and traits. Whereas say a group like ""Eternals"" they all feel too homogeneous and everyone in that group just blends into one character. So it doesn't feel like a group but one entity.",2023-08-04

- I was emotionally invested in every scene that had Rocket Raccoon, specially that last scene with Layla. 
- Beastie Boys fight scene was def one of the best action pieces in MCU. 
- Adam Warlock seem a bit underutilized but hopefully has more stuff in future movies. 
- Great cameos and callbacks from previous movies. 
- Movie dragged in few parts, wish it was a bit tighter and well paced like the first one. 

Also, the movie felt like a big ad for pet adoption and I def hugged my pup once I got home. I would rate this a 6.8/10",2023-05-05
"Just saw it. So good. 

The wrapping of all the arcs was so good.

But man The High Evolutionary. He was such a good villain, just complete and utter evil. No sympathy bullshit, it's great seeing a villain just be a bastard.

He is a crazy alien with a mega-ship, gravity powers and a face mask. But his effectiveness is because he is a very real villain. He is a nasty little abuser. Lording his superiority over others and is driven to hysterics and fury when he realises Rocket is smarter than him. Mocking Rocket's grief, after he murdered his friend. The whole, I created you, so I own you for the rest of your life. When his crew turned on him, the towering fury as he destroyed the cockpit rather than sensibly compromise. He could be a guy without powers anywhere, and he would torture the people around him, to justify himself and his superiority.",2023-05-07

Nothing like watching animals get tortured for 90 minutes on a Sunday afternoon.  I don't know if Gunn thought he was being emotional and high-brow with all the suffering animals it really just felt like cheap pulling on the heartstrings and overly violent to me.

Then you have the bad guy who is running around torturing them and screaming constantly.  Some real academy award winning material right there.  Several of the actors felt very phoned-in with their performances, Zoe Saldana in particular.

The plot felt very The Last Jedi/Return of Skywalker as others have mentioned.  Didn't make a whole lot of sense to me and was constantly jumping everywhere.  I also had difficulty believing with the level of violence that this got by with a PG-13 rating.

I think Marvel and Disney have really lost it since Endgame.  Once they realized they were making money hand over fist they were compelled to continue to pump out movie after movie  in order to make their quarterly profit goals.

"That has been definitely one of the better MCU movies since a long time. Honestly my biggest gripe about it is that it kind of feels like two movies merged into one. On the one hand we had the whole Rocket and High Evolutionary storyline, on the other humour and music of previous GotG movies. I think the latter could be better here, it just all seemed kind of forced sometimes imo. Like music being there only because it's Guardians movie so it has to have music or humour not being the best. Still as a whole it was definitely good movie.

And I really don't like Phyla. It was just so random. I don't like her being one of hundreds children and not unique, her being in Guardians at the end without any good reason (why would they take kid in?), her suddenly having powers. Plus according to High Evolutionary the kids aren't creative at all and that doesn't seem like an interesting character trait. And of course, another prominent LGBT character being very young.

Edit: Most Guardians character still aren't the best unfortunately, especially Drax who is still the same, and Nebula who should have a bigger role since she's the one who has know Rocket the longest. The game had them all so much better.",2023-05-07

I came in prepared to burn the theatre down if they killed rocket.  But once I saw that he was goign to be in a coma like the whole movie, I knew he wasn't going to die which make me feel better.

Anyway, the action was top notch, the humor was great, this was a glorious send off for this guys.  

And throwing a Fuck into this movie.  I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT.  Amazing.

Worst of all was the tropy flashbacks to Rocket‚Äî probably the most unlikeable of the group. It was so obvious what was going to happen with the other characters, there was next to no emotional connection or payoff. It was like watching a Racoon version of the Book of Boba Fett when he‚Äôs in that Bacta tank.

"The strongest feeling I had about GotG3 is it feels like a big budget version of the straight to VHS sequels of Disney films in the 90‚Äôs, far closer to the throwaway recent GotG Holiday Special than I was expecting. 

It‚Äôs a very navel-gazing and self-indulgent film. James Gunn seems to focus myopically on things that he‚Äôs passionate about - like the actors he obviously thinks of as family - to the detriment of good character writing and story. While ideally filmmakers should speak from the heart, he has a simplistic and heavy handed approach to emotion in his films and this is one of the worst examples.

The pacing and editing makes the film drag for the 2 1/2 hour runtime. Scenes constantly hang uncomfortably after their natural finish before a new one appears with a sudden misplaced pop song, that feels a far cry from the iconic soundtrack use of the first film.

The choreography of many scenes, including but not just action sequences, is awkward and lacking dynamism. Events happen on the screen without any weight to them, enemies are dispatched perfunctorily like an arcade shooter, and there‚Äôs never a feeling of any real stakes despite the aforementioned over-wrought emotions.
The use of CGI has a large part in this, with a flagship hallway fight scene feeling empty and lacking impact. On the flip side, the heroes‚Äô home in Knowhere is a decidedly practical single set reused from the Holiday Special that makes the space station built in the head of a dead celestial being feel like a small market square in a mid-budget sci-fi TV show.

There‚Äôs a cliched narrative structure of Rocket‚Äôs flashbacks while he‚Äôs unconscious which penetrates throughout the film and disturbs the flow of the story. This conceit is also responsible for the current Rocket not being present for 75% of the film, a very strange choice.

Outside of the admittedly emotive Rocket backstory, there‚Äôs very little meaningful character development and writing. Most of the interactions between the cast take the place of forced, impotent disputes that resolve with a shrug or throwaway comedy moments which land flat, meaning when the last act wraps up and the team all have their arcs concluded (after several minutes of awkward dancing), it‚Äôs unearned and unsatisfying. The attention is spread thinly across too many players, with Gamora and Adam Warlock noticeably having very little to do. The latter feels like a big disappointment after the promise of Will Poulter‚Äôs appearance in the MCU, and the character could have been quite easily sliced out of the film with minimal adjustments.",2023-05-07

"Give a thumbs up if you were annoyed at how utterly stupid they made Adam Warlock. Instead of being a menacing villian such as the High Evolutionary, they made him out to be completely stupid and child-like, when he is an adult.

It was so cringe what they did with his character, it made me think of Shazam, when the boy turns into the adult superhero, he talks and acts like a kid, i feel like they were doing the same thing with him.

When they were interrogating the prisoner, why on earth would Walock shoot him?? That was so stupid. And in the begining, the High Evolutionary would have sent him to capture Rocket, not kill him.

And at the end, even though he killed someone in cold blood, he gets to save Peter and be a hero, pretty much becoming an extended member of the Guardians.

The times he was in the movie were low points for me, thankfully he isnt in the movie that much.

I swear on my life, if they made a movie soley about this particular Adam Warlock played by this actor, i couldnt be paid enough to go see it.",2023-05-09

"Wasn't planning on seeing this (I haven't even watched the second one),  but I'm curious as to whether someone can give some insight into a Facebook post I saw. Was curious as to whether there's actual merit to this. 



""Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is the most anti trans movie  I've ever seen! How did James Gunn, canceled by the woke mob at Disney, then rehired get away with this? Jason Farley clued me into this.

SPOILERS BELOW

Bad guy literally transmutates animals. Turning then against their biology.

Rocket Racoon struggles to embrace his true biology. Only later coming to terms with who he was actually created as.

Villian claims there is no God until he stepped in.

Wanted to create a world without bigots. World he created resembles meth laden streets of San Francisco.

The villian has tons of children in cages who are rescued.

Holy cow this is some subtle writing and the fact that Disney didn't see the message is crazy to me.""

After all the recent Marvel releases I'm happy Guardians maintained their consistency with how entertaining and enjoyable their movies always are. Also Adam Warlock came of a bit of a comedic relief character but idc I laughed everytime especially when he was about to fuck groot up and then just passed out lmao. Hope we can see more of his serious side in the future especially with how strong he really is.,2023-05-05
This film in a way reminded me of Top Gun Maverick: lots of red flags of the characters' death but no one died & a satisfying ending for all of them. It's definitely the most emotional MCU film to date,2023-05-05
Well add that one fight to the list of excellent hallway fight scenes in movies.,2023-05-05
"It‚Äôs not as tight as the first, but I genuinely think the first is one of my favorite written, directed and paced blockbusters ever (and without a doubt my favorite Marvel film). I adored this film, I was a little concerned Gunn was going to go a bit too far into the morbid and sadness of the Guardian‚Äôs trauma, but it felt so necessary to see Rocket‚Äôs tragic backstory to understand why he holds his new family so dearly. The High Evolutionary may be a typical evil God-complex villain, but the performance, actions against his creations, and connection to Rocket really made him stand out as a memorable and cruel antagonist. 

I love how the 3rd act ties the characters up without ridiculous conveniences or killing them off instead choosing to give the Guardians natural next steps and endings. Say what you want about Gunn, but you can tell he really loved these characters with how he chose to leave them off this film. The line about Drax not being a destroyer but a father really got to me emotionally and the whole montage on Nowhere at the end was just beautiful. 

I have loved these characters since their initial 2008 comic run and am so grateful this trilogy exists and gave them the spotlight they deserved flaws and all. It‚Äôs like a 9.5/10 imo with my biggest issues being Warlock feeling a bit of a waste, Groot being a bit too much to the side, and the Rocket flashbacks coming abruptly at times even if they were great. Gunn really went for it with the violence and gross creature/body horror with this one.",2023-05-05
Did anyone else notice that the singer from the Christmas special was there and just had no lines?,2023-05-05
"I think this was an amazing closure to the GoTG trilogy. It also makes me really excited to see what James Gunn has in store for the DC universe, because if you let him take the reigns, he can make a damn good movie. I loved that it was a movie that basically stood on its own and didn‚Äôt need the normal Marvel cameo hype or needed to be a preparation film for the next big Marvel arc. 

My only critique: (may have been because I was a bit tired), the cinematography in the first half with the one shot techniques he was consistently doing was literally getting me motion sick. I got so dizzy I had to leave for a few seconds. Could‚Äôve been that this needed to be viewed via center seats for full effect, but adjusting to the zoom-ins and 360s and all the other camera movement he did from the side of the theater was a lot for me.

Side note: Nebula was a fucking rockstar this movie. Probably my favorite character now. It‚Äôs amazing to see the ending to her character arc and all the growth she experienced.",2023-05-05

"9/10 movie for me. Fun adventure and feels good movie. Lots of death fake out and I'm happy no one died cause theres so much more stories to tell and it's awesome for them to come back for cameos for Avengers etc. Hits especially hard if you have pets.

That hallway scene. prob one of the best marvel action sequence. Every character had a good closing arc. Adam Warlock seemed under utilized, but I like Will Poulter and Adam Warlock and the new guardians crew, so can't wait to see what's next.",2023-05-05

"Since probably NWH, Marvel has lot the ability to write emotion. The heart just vanished, the jokes got stale, the action became forgettable. MCU's crown on the blockbuster world slipped and fell. James Gunn reminded me that most of the MCU has still been defined by fun action, well rounded flawed characters and a good sense of emotion to tie the whole thing together. It stings he won't get to lead the cosmic side of Marvel like originally planned but he'll kill it for DC. The second MCU film besides Endgame to make me tear up and over fuckin cyborg animals none the less. I love you Gunn. I don't know what will happen with the MCU from here on out, but it might be the epilogue for me, (for now).

8/10.",2023-05-05

"James Gunn did an amazing job. The characters felt like the best version of themselves, none of them were as incompetent or too jokey as they used to be, they were perfect, the hallway fight scene (holy shit what a scene) easily goes to show that. They really drove home just how much of a family they've become, felt so human. 

As a Marvel movie, it felt so good to have another one that didn't talk down to you. It was mature, brutal, and made it all the more real. The movie looked like a movie and had incredible visuals. And a great villain to hate, what an incredible face reveal. Bravo. Shoutout Rocket!",2023-05-05

"James Gunn could make a damn good Doom movie if he was so inclined to. Those bio-mechanical henchmen (and the ways they were executed by the Guardians in that hallway scene) reminded me of some Doom enemies. Obviously he‚Äôll be busy with DC for likely many years to come, but damnit he‚Äôd crush a proper Doom adaptation.",2023-05-05
"*We‚Äôll all fly away together, one last time‚Ä¶ into the forever, and beautiful sky*

Never had a MCU movie be so emotionally resonant with me before. I‚Äôm surprised none of the Guardians died, but I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt. As an audience member I felt that everyone deserved the happy ending, and it was nice to have purely happy tears for the Florence and the Machine dance sequence at the end after so many despair tears over the course of the movie. 

If there‚Äôs a criticism I have to make it‚Äôs Adam Warlock, it just didn‚Äôt really feel like James Gunn knew what he wanted to do with him. Kind of felt like the idea he had for him changed between Guardians 2 and 3. Also, it felt weird to have the ‚ÄúThe Legendary Star-Lord Will Return‚Äù card after what felt like a tight, narrative conclusion for the character. I love Star-Lord so I‚Äôm excited to see what kind of role he has for the future, it‚Äôs just hard to see what kind of story he has to come back to. The new Avengers movies seem like the obvious answer but still, I‚Äôm just wondering why they would need to include him.",2023-05-05
"Well this was really good. Worthy follow up to the last two Guardians films and the best MCU anything since Endgame rather easily. Mostly because it has so much more heart than anything else in this universe

They really let Gunn loose with this. Camera movements were a bit much for me at times though. It was a hard PG-13 too with some really grotesque stuff. I feel like some parents will be a little surprised. Might be a bit much for some kids who saw the other movies. The scenes with animal cruelty were especially difficult to watch and really emotionally effecting. 

Overall though it really was a great conclusion to all character arcs. I kinda loved it",2023-05-05

"Well there were definitely certain scenes that gave me an idea of the type of tone Gunn wants to encapsulate in Superman. Plus, he does what he always does by showing how each character is useful in their own ways, making me even more excited than I already was for his plans with the creature commandos. DC is in great hands.",2023-05-06

"This movie reminded me why I fell in love with the mcu and superhero films in general after seeing Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. A great villain, great characters, amazing action, some well placed humor, and a whole lot of heart. Hope Disney learns from this and stops pumping out mediocre films for profit",2023-05-06

Humor that consistently landed, violence and imaginative creatures that really pushed the PG 13 rating, well crafted fight scenes, intriguing character development for 6 characters at once, a captivating villain who you actually hate, and emotional moments that really hit and weren't undermined by one liners and quips. Very well done IMO and should be viewed as a good sci-fi movie just as much as it will be viewed as a good super hero movie.",2023-05-06

"I really enjoyed it, cried so many times, especially when The Dog Rays Are Over started playing AND THEN THEY PLAYED COME AND GET YOUR LOVE and yeah you could say I was bawling so fricking hard. I love that the villan isnt some random dude thats wanna destroy the universe or whatever, and I could actually hate him because of his connections to Rocket. The humor was very good, and the Gamora and Quill situation was done really well, I really enjoyed it. Its still hurts not to see them together but I understand that this is what they both need - with Gamora finding her own path and Peter finally moving on. Yeah overall I think it's definetly a good and solid ending to the series, with everyones characters being so beautifully summaried and ended. It felt like old mcu movies :]",2023-05-06

"Wait what was the villain‚Äôs name again? Anyway yeah that villain guy pushed the limits of PG 13, but it was pretty interesting that the weird design of his covered up face actually meant something, and it wasn‚Äôt just some goofy feature of them being an alien human thing.",2023-05-06

"The animations on Rocket and his friends were amazing. I definitely teared up during pretty much all their scenes together.


I'm also surprised how much blood and bodily harm was in this. I don't remember any MCU movie having consequences from being battle injuries. High Evolutionary's last scene was straight horror.",2023-05-06
"Drax the Dad.

Oh my god.

I did not expect to cry in a Marvel movie like that.  Like the end of Endgame and Infinity War were sad but not really cry inducing for me.  But holy shit @ this.  I guess animal cruelty, even in CGI, hits something different.

"it's a really lovely movie! Wholesome, lot of heart, with the weirdness that you'd expect from a James Gunn movie. The weird visuals and humor might not be for everyone but I think if you know what to expect you'll love this movie. The soundtrack was a banger, the visuals were great too (great to see legitimately good marvel CGI again finally), and the camera work and action set pieces were some of the best I've seen in recent memory. Overall, a great sendoff.",2023-05-06
I made a really big mistake when watching this movie. I forgot to bring tissues. God damn there were so many just emotional moments. Rocket and his friends especially üò•,2023-05-07
"The two most heartbreaking parts in this movie for me that breaks my heart is Rockets first word ""hurts"". Little baby Rocket was so scared and in pain. He didn't deserve that :(. the second thing is Lyllas death and then Rockets anguished cry of pain. That BROKE ME. I'm glad we get a happy ending for this. Its an emotional happy ending at that. it's the end of the james gunn guardians era. Now my review of it:

I've seen it twice now and it's a 9/10 for me. I wish we saw more of Adam warlock. He was good with what we have of him. I found him to be pretty funny but overall he was meh to me. And I feel like we deserve a little bit of a backstory with nebula. Like she's an adopted daughter of Thanos too. Where did she come from? We literally have nothing of her backstory. But maybe this movie was too overstuffed to give her a backstory too. I didn't need it. But I kinda want it. Everything else, is a 10/10. If it wasn't for those two things this movie would be a 10/10 but no movie is perfect. Not even endgame. Loved this movie too. We now have the perfect trilogy of guardians movies.  Rockets backstory tho üíîüíîüíîüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ rockets first word spoken is ""hurts"" oh man that gets me everytime and then his anguished cry as he sees lylla die in front of him üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòâ literal pain. Little rocket didn't deserve that.  Another thing that I was hoping would happen is rocket meeting Groot for the first time. That kinda sucks. I wanted to see that. also who remembers this scene from Infinity War: Thor: ""I assume you're the captain sir."" Rocket: ""You're very perceptive"" Thor: ""You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?"" Rocket: ""Oh yeah just let me just ask the captain. Oh wait a second it's me. Yeah I'll go"" They predicted Rockets ending for Guardians 3. Not ready to say goodbye to these Guardians tho. I'm gonna miss them. Also that one long shot hallway fight scene with No Sleep till Brooklyn playing was FIRE ASFFFFFFFF",2023-05-07
Which classical music is High Evolutionary playing while he explains the meaning of it?,2023-05-07
"Such a great conclusion to a trilogy. Probably the darkest MCU movie, but definitely worth it. 

I would've loved to see a Drax and Mantis spinoff, but I guess the Christmas special was the best we'll ever get from the two of them.",2023-05-07
So refreshing. That's what a good marvel movie is supposed to feel like.    Hope they can find their way,2023-05-07
"I haven‚Äôt felt this happy with and MCU project in a very long time. It‚Äôs a genuine work of art, and radiating Gunn‚Äôs signature style.

Not super invested in any of the announced content, so it might be last Marvel film I see, at least for a while. What a way to go out, though.",2023-05-07

"First of all I freaking love their playlist in this movie, the music selection for guardian of galaxy has always been on point. Plus the great story arc for everyone in the movie and humor were on points. So far definitely the best movie from MCU since infinity war",2023-05-07

"My gfs dog passed a couple weeks ago. She had had him for 15 years, they had an incredibly special bond. You can pretty much imagine the amount of years in this movie. I think that emotional impact and gravity adds a ton to this movie and makes me actually care about the stakes, their relationships and their personal journeys.

‚ÄúThis was your story all along‚Äù for some reason really got to me. I‚Äôve been a person who has lifelong feeling of being a creep or freak. I‚Äôve always felt the character resonate with me pretty strongly and I really enjoyed his story and I‚Äôm a huge fan of what Gunn plans to do with DC and their characters. 

9/10 for me",2023-05-07
The no sleep till Brooklyn scene did not have to go that hard. One of the best MCU action scenes by far,2023-05-07
"This movie is so heart wrenching like, got me teary eyed for so long.

I dont know how they did it, but they successfully pulled off how much the guardians love and care for each other.

It was so palpable I got goosebumps, tears, and strange sense of longing for a friendship Ive only seen as an audience.",2023-05-07
"Just got out of the cinema.

I know it's been said a lot but one of the best MCU films in a long long time. 

Really like that Gunn is able to push the envelope a tiny bit further in terms of maturity. 

Also liked the robocop reference, brought back memories of seeing robocops weird bald face after he took off his helmet",2023-05-07

He could finally care for himself, the problem was not that they were inferior, the problem was that the bad guy saw them as different.",2023-05-07

"The Guardians are certainly quite a diff breed than the usual heroes.   
I've never heard a hero say 'Kill them all' before.   
And Quill was saying that to Groot, who later saves Adam since 'everyone deserves a 2nd chance'  
I'm not complaining, I actually never cottoned on the 'turn the other cheek' philosophy.  


Also, Rocket is also from earth! Which could explain his affinity for the music. Even if he didn't know why (Guardians 2)  


I agree, the best MCU movie since Endgame.   
With Gunn now co-CEO of DC, this might turn it the other way now, DC quality-wise over MCU.   
Maybe the studio execs shd back off dictating over the creatives.",2023-05-14
"GuardianOfTheGalaxyVol3 was a great 3rd film and a fine addition to the trilogy. The guardian films continue to be my favourite part of the  MCU and it will be interesting to see where they go in the future. Definitely had me tearing up at some of the emotional moments. All the cast got there moments to shine and I think they all got endings that were fitting but left them open to return, should they ever want to. Chukwudi Iwuji was great as High Evolutionary, from his first introduction you just knew he would be easy to hate and he so was. Maria Bakalova was great again as cosmo and i look forward to her turning up again. The use of music was great as always and gunn certainly knows how to use it and weave it into his stories.",2023-05-14

"This is probably the most emotional movie in the series, all while no one dies. Comicbook movies are often low stakes with emotional scenes not feeling authentic. All flash capeshit.

There are some great marvel movies but this is one of the few marvel movies where I felt proper emotion. I legitimately felt sad for Peter accepting that for all intents purposes, the Gamora he knew is dead. An entire life of abuse for Rocket and how Drax, Mantis and Nebula's sad pasts are constantly pushing then to soul search. It's filled with themes like accepting reality, facing trauma and moving on.

All that plus realizing that this is an end of an era for possibly the best trilogy within the MCU impacted me far more than any reversible character death. Combined with nostalgic music like Dog Days are Over and realizing that this was a trilogy that began over a decade ago, I never expected a comicbook movie to hit this hard.",2023-06-04

So yeah, I don't think it was the right story for the last movie.  The acting and production values were top notch of course, good humor as well.  What they could've done is what makes the whole thing sad.",2023-07-30
I'm super nervous they would fuck up since the last few movies have been.. not very good but they stuck the landing PERFECTLY! Super excited to see James Gunn DCU,2023-08-02

"3 months late.

Watched it twice on Disney+. Great movie",2023-08-09
This movie rocks. It‚Äôs even better on a rewatch.,2023-08-12
"Ok so the question at the end, favorite musical acts; aren't there tons and tons of other planets with life on it. Why'd they only choose earth artists. Are we supposed to believe earth is the only place with music or good music. I understand the audience wouldn't know non earth artists, it's just weird to me that the writers don't think of those things. Kraglin says ""the man, Garth Brooks"" like they're all supposed to know.",2023-08-12
Star Lord no rocket boots or helmet was a little silly. He's my fav mcu character and that like Superman without his cape or Spiderman without webs lol.,2023-08-12
"I just watched it so I‚Äôm still reflecting. Man, I love Rocket more than ever. Nebula was great. Kraglin was great too. Didn‚Äôt like puffy Groot and I guess I never thought Mantis should‚Äôve been a mainstay. Just my opinions",2023-08-13
"Gotg never disappoints. Such a good cinema. I hope they do a sequel to video game too. It was as good as the movies.

The villain in this one was really good too. Both the writing and acting 10/10. Deserves special mention.",2023-08-18
"good film, just like to know where's the rock reference, they did ""don't move or the bunny gets it"" from con air, they take off the villain's face from face off, 2 Nic cage films from the trinity the missing one is the rock",2023-08-18

"When I tell you I cried, I did. It's probably childish but Guardians is and will forever be the best marvel group to me. Sad to see it end but I'm glad they all got closure. I will still watch all three movies every year.",2023-09-02
"This was a weird one. The only characters I actually cared about were the group of test animals. I kind of expected Rocket to have to sacrifice himself and then some emotional scene where he's back with them. But what we got was a bit meh.

I've watched most marvel films. I don't remember them finding Gamora or knowing she was alive. They hammered home that she wasn't the same Gamora to the point where maybe the film would've been better if her character wasn't in it. I also do not remember the Russian dog and the guy with the floating dagger thing. I felt like they expected me to know them and I felt like I'd not done my MCU homework. As for Adam Warlock, he was just kind of there. I kept waiting for him to become a more important character and properly team up with the guardians, but it didn't really come. I don't feel like the film would've suffered much if his character wasn't in it. 

Some of the monsters were a bit grotesque and creepy but I guess that's what it was going for. There was also some that were kind of bad looking.There was something a bit Doctor Who about them for me, especially on counter earth, which took me out of the film a bit. The villain was decent but I kind of felt like he could've been more, he was ultimately easily defeated. In the end he was a standard Marvel villain.

The ending was kind of meh. Their reasons for leaving the group felt a little contrived. I think I was expecting a character to die or something. So ultimately the final act felt a bit standard marvel when it could've been something a little bit better. This is one of the better recent marvel films though.",2023-09-02
"Horrible movie. 

It's a fucking goofy movie, let's put some hardcore animal torture in it. 

What the fuck is that. Fuck this movie.",2023-09-06
Why would you disband the gotg when there‚Äôs barely any likable characters left in the mcu? Dumb as hell,2023-10-01
I gotta say i was really impressed with this movie. With how alot of MCU is nowadays i expected lazy writing. It really seems to me that Spiderman and GOTG are the two big stories of modern MCU.,2023-10-23
"Loved it, I adore the first movie and this isn‚Äôt too far off from it. Perfect send off for every single one of these characters. It takes a LOT for me to cry during a movie and I cried at least 3-4 times.",2023-11-17
"Just gotta say, loved the movie! Chukuwudi absolutely killed it, backed by a solid script. Knowhere's world-building blew my mind; the written languages, side characters, fictional brands, and all those other details made the GotG universe pop! You could tell that they put a lot of love and dedication into it. Areta and Orgocorp were a joy to explore as well.

On the other hand, Counter-Earth was disappointing. The High Evolutionary's choice to go model it after mid 20th-century US felt odd, considering the advanced tech he possesses and his taste in music. I expected a sleek, utopian design, or at least something similar to his ship. Maybe it's just me, though.",2023-11-17

Did anyone catch that Rocket and Floor were cuddling before HE came crashing in? üòû,2024-02-14
"I think it‚Äôs also worth noting that the third assistant of HE seemed to have such a better moral compass than HE‚Äôs (not that she was better as a person but just lesser evil I guess). Even during the scene when Rocket solves the violent problem, she finishes his sentence in awe instead of feeling threatened like HE did. She was also opposing him in many ways. Then the ending when she finally gathers the courage to go against him (and sadly dying).",2024-02-14

Is that supposed to be a monkey?,2023-05-06
"it felt to me like the flanderization was getting a bit much for Drax even before this movie and it definitely hit its peak here but i did love how they confronted it by having Mantis defend him from Nebula and showed Drax's true value as one of the Guardians.

"The movie was terrible.  After thor love and thunder, i thought that was the greatest let down of the mcu, but nope.... this was. Such a great cast and they came out with that crap. The rocket backstory was depressing and not that intriguing.  Gotg movies have always been max entertainment and jocular. The introduction of animal cruelty cast an unwelcome feeling unto the movie and ruined it. I've a lot more to say about it, but the one other aspect that was awful was the ending with groot. Cheesey and unnecessary.",2023-05-26
"I found myself laughing LOUDLY during >!spoiler the scene where the otter was shot dead. Complete silence in the theater. 9/10 jokes were a miss for me. The buildup to the death of all the animals was just a culmination of how bad of a movie this was. Also found myself laughing at the animals in heaven scene at just how silly they made the animals look and the buildup. Main character early on in the movie is all about, ‚Äúhey no killing that‚Äôs not who we are.‚Äù Then proceeds to murder everything including the headset guy in the water. How the hero‚Äôs have fallen. Pacing was super slow. Ending scene was painful to watch the forced interactions and dancing scenes.!<",2023-05-12

"I liked his men turning on him. Not just being mindless goons.  Though, they should shot before he turned around lol.",2023-05-06
"I did some research and I think why he did so well was because he used to do Shakespeare. He was in Julius Ceaser, The Merry Wives of Windsor, King Lear, Coriolanus, and Antony & Cleopatra. Honestly, I'm not surprised because he gave the High Evolutionary such an air of grace and evilness.",2023-05-08
Also dude has a vision and he stick to it. Despicable as fuck but you completely understand his motivation and obsession.,2023-05-06
"I was watching some reviews before watching the movie (I know, I sinned) and most of them didn't like him.  Coming out of the movie, i thought he was a fantastic one shot villain.  He played moments where he was ""human"" like when he was proud of Rocket for being intelligent and detestable really well.

Also a side note, I really liked how the ship turned on him, that was new for MCU iirc.",2023-05-08
"Agreed, he actually seemed unhinged and insane compared to most other Marvel villains who are typically just major assholes.",2023-05-08
"To be fair non of the big villians in recent MCU movies are jokey or use quips. Wenwu, Green Goblin, Wanda, Namor and Kang were all pretty fucking serious and terrifying at points.",2023-05-06

The actor did a phenomenal job. I‚Äôve never hated a villain so much.,2023-05-08
"Yes - I thought he might be too similar to Kang in Ant-Man, they are similar types of character, but the High Evolutionary had a very different demeanour. He seemed to be trying very hard to appear always the aloof, ‚Äúgodlike‚Äù leader, singularly focused on his ‚Äúnoble goal‚Äù. But he constantly loses his temper and his composure, exposing himself as just a petty, petulant and cruel man.",2023-05-08
He was perfect. Managed to hit pitch perfect reads of the most ridiculous lines and never let me stop hating him for a fraction of a second. His commitment was godlike.,2023-05-09
"yep as gamora noted

He wipes our ENTIRE species and civilizations,even thanos wasn't that nuts he would leave half of you alive",2023-05-09

"He‚Äôs such a perfect foil to everything the Guardians represent. He wants complete uniform perfection. The Guardians welcome all strays and outcasts, flaws and scars and all.",2023-05-13
Oh my gosh yes. I wanted him to suffer the entire time I was watching (the character not the actor). He was amazingly written and well acted. I especially liked when Quill was like yeah we don't need to hear your backstory. Because we didn't need to he was a terrible person with philosophical motives who went nuts because someone was smarter than him. Honestly after watching I wondered why they didn't have Gunn take over for Ant-Man & The Wasp I feel like he would have done a better job with Kang overall. Like yeah Kang was kind of scary but The High Evolutionary was straight up terrifying maybe it's because he didn't have a cookie cutter goal of take over everything ever.,2023-05-09
"He‚Äôs not that big of a dick in the comics, but the MCU and the comics are two different things so it works. Casually blowing up counter-earth is a great way to establish ‚Äúthis High Evolutionary is a monster worse than anything the Guardians have faced before‚Äù .",2023-05-09

And it's nice that for once it's just a villain, a hissable detestable bad guy who kills cute animals. Instead of a tragic back story or reasoned monster or sympathetic.",2023-05-09
For real. His intensity was so insane. Watched antman other day and this guy killed being a villain. The writing I'm sure helps but good lord the guy was brutal don't wanna spoil,2023-05-08

i just wish he was a little bit more powerful.,2023-05-08

He feels powerful and he is vile. He is the best Marvel villain in ages.,2023-05-14
Just saw it this week and this was one of the few villains in a comic movie that I truly hated with all my heart because of the animal treatment.,2023-05-15
"And best of all, the story wasn‚Äôt ever *about* him. I even kind of wanted Peter or Rocket to cut him off when ranting at the end and yell ‚Äúit‚Äôs *not about you*, asshole‚Äù and then just kill him or leave him to die. In a way, that‚Äôs kind of what they did, I just would have liked the meta commentary that not every comic book movie needs to be *about* the villain. Villains don‚Äôt always deserve sympathy, High Evolutionary being the best example. 

But absolutely, I loved him, he was so fucking intense. I‚Äôve missed that in other villains. They‚Äôre always full of themselves, but in the vain, needy way. This dude gave no fucks, he was absolutely single-minded and focused on his own goal.",2023-05-10
I can't ever remember feeling *visceral hatred* for an MCU villain before. Iwuji was brilliant.,2023-05-10
"His performance made my skin crawl, it was like watching a skinwalker or something.

Best villain in the MCU tbh, purely for his acting and direction",2023-05-21
"The way James Gunn wrote him to show that Rocket being special and getting away drive him madder and madder, to the point his other creations revolted against him was brilliant. TBH I didn‚Äôt think Gunn was that great at villains but this is Micheal Keaton as Vulture levels of great villians.",2023-05-23
He was fantastic.,2023-05-12
"Just catching up and seeing it / piggy backing here, but this was my thought exactly that he was a perfect villain given that his pursuits were so clear and laid out but also so fundamentally detestable. So, so good.",2023-05-28

Guy killed it!",2023-05-26
">High Evolutionary

reminded me of the bad guy from the Firefly movie.",2023-05-10
"He was such a shrieking psychotic mess. It made for a very scary and thus effective villain. I think it helps that everyone around him seems so helpless, which I guess they were. All of Rockets origin scenes had me on edge and almost in tears. Had to be the most satisfying ass whooping of any marvel villain so far",2023-06-11
This actor played it just right when a lesser actor would‚Äôve Eddie Redmayned-it and played it horribly. Chefs kiss!,2023-05-11
">More I think about it, High Evolutionary is by far one of the best MCU villains.

....you mean besides the terrible ""plan"" of getting his ship destroyed, mutineied crew and incredibly weak fight finale?

Very well acted though.",2023-05-11
"Jeah, but he had no development. I still wonder what his story is. I didn't understand his motivation. Why the animals? Wh earth? Why kill everyone? Why anything?",2023-05-11
"A classic villain, yes‚Äî but no, the best villains have a bit of give and take in them.",2023-05-14
"And not a single bit of sympathetic story. That threw me off so badly with Kang. I want a big bad who IS a big bad, not just a misguided baddie.",2023-05-10
High Evolutionary was how Kangs character should‚Äôve been portrayed in Quantumania‚Ä¶but seeing as that was only a variant of him im HOPING they get it right in his next appearance,2023-08-06
"I thought he was great and really liked the concept, which made me think about how we think of the god in the bible. Creates us to please his own ego, then when we don‚Äôt turn out exactly as he wants casts us aside. Yet his creations still love him",2023-08-05
Eh it was cartoonish and lacking in nuance,2023-05-09
"No one holds a candle to thanos.

Open the FUCKING door,2023-05-08
I like that they addressed it.  Quill would naturally have a problem accepting she doesn't have feelings for him and Gamora would have a problem being treated like she's someone else.  Having this conflict resolved the way they did felt organic and allowed the characters to grow.,2023-05-06

yup it was nice to see that ravagers were in fact her Gaurdians...referring back to when Peter said to her that Gaurdians is her family not ravagers,2023-05-08

"Yeah, with the exception of Antman 3, most of the Marvel movies lately have been really dreary or at least were chill until a sudden bittersweet ending.

I‚Äôm glad this movie avoided that despite having all the set up to axe half the cast",2023-05-08
"I stayed away from anything referencing the music too. And every song just hit me. Plus the closing song is one that really has gotten me thru some rough times and then again with the family during covid. 

I was weepy, but my daughter was in tears. Happy steong joyful tears.",2023-05-08

I hope/think they're saving to reunite Peter and Gamora for next movie (akin to gotg1 and 2) at first I was disappointed they didn't but when it said Peter will return I thought alright maybe that's wgat they're doing. Thinking after Gamora spent time working with the guardians in this movie and starts to unlock her emotions and let down guard and she goes bavk to ravagers she'll realize she's not as happy realize what real family is,2023-05-09
"I would hope this is not truly a farewell to the Guardians, and that we see these characters again in other Marvel projects.",2023-05-11
But Original Gamora was replaced by a version of herself she would not have liked that broke her old relationships. Its happy for this new Gamora not the actual Gamora if that makes sense? Keep seeing this pop up. This is not our Gamora's ending. not really happy to me sorry. Still great movie just not uplifting to me.,2023-05-16

"> that they didn‚Äôt rekindle Quill and Gamora‚Äôs relationship. 

Uh, what version did you see? Some rough-cut bootleg?

The version that played in my auditorium definitely sets up that just like the ""other"" Gamora, Peter's character (loyal, humorous, noble when he needs to be and above all else good-hearted) is starting to change this Gamora's attitude towards life and *him.*

That's the beauty of Gunn's writing here, avoiding a neat & tidy reunion between them even though Quill entirely ""deserves"" this happy ending. But Gunn isn't going to just hand it to him. To me, it's an accomplished balancing act that comments on the nature of ""true love:"" that Quill and Gamora really are made for each other, but it's not some ""distany"" that bonds them it's that they have and are witness to shared experiences that make them respect, admire & love each other. 

Gamora is retracing the steps of her own self to discover that she is capable of it while Peter is learning to accept that this Gamora is a totally different person that he needs to relate to as a unique individual. 

It's a shame that Alan Horn didn't have the backbone or sense to avoid firing James Gunn. Marvel is going to suffer from not having Gunn around to help the MCU succeed in the post Cap & Tony phases. But, I guess some will argue that DC needed him more.",2023-05-07
"The ending was actually the weakest part of the movie, can't they for once end on a more sombre note. Was 100% expecting one of them to die. Also Rocket not shooting the high evolutionary in the head at the end is just an eye roll.",2023-05-12

"This was the scene I came here to talk about. I just saw it. I can still hear that little bunny frantically yelling. I cried a few times during that movie and it was very painful at moments.

The whole thing made we feel uncomfortable to be honest. I mean Guardians was always weird but in a good way. Here I felt uncomfortable.,2023-05-07
"*Spoilers ahead, read at your own risk.*

This whole backstory disturbed me greatly. I was emotional the minute the movie started; when the hand came into the baby raccoon cage and they were cowering and hiding in fear. Rocket gets thrown into another cage after undergoing horrific tests. The poor guy is scalped, among other things. He can only utter the words ""hurt"", in a sad and weakened voice. Then, we‚Äôre introduced to his other animal friends who have endured pain, torture, and other ungodly body horrors. The reveal of Floor (this sweet little white bunny) was the hardest for me. Poor thing has a metal jaw for a mouth, her cute little feet dangling in front of her, and then these terrifying spider legs coming out from her sides. Anytime the movie did a flashback to Rocket and his friends, I would cry. Even after those scenes were over, I was still very upset because I couldn‚Äôt take my mind off of them. It was a good movie, but I felt very drained once the credits rolled haha. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be that dark.

Edit: I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who was scarred from the animal abuse. Those scenes were very harrowing and heartbreaking. I‚Äôll be thinking about it for a long time.",2023-05-08

Rocket's scream when Lylla dies and he's just standing there in that wide shot all helpless...damn. That scream was just so...real..and full of pain. It was so good that I got scared the MCU is gonna pull a classic MCU and have a High evolutionartu guy drop a joke or something else comedic and ruin the moment. But nooope. They just let that sit and MAN! That was just suchhh a real and hard moment. I miss when MCU used to do that. Thank you James Gunn! You killed it!

">The DCU is gonna rock and I hope Marvel learned as many lessons as they could from Gunn‚Äôs time with them. 

I dunno if they did. I felt like the only real problem with this movie was how rushed it all felt in the first half. There was kinda too much squeezed in there, and that's been the biggest issue with all the stuff since Endgame. Too much in too tight a package leading to a movie that feels rushed but is still too long. Something tells me they're going to keep doing that for a while at this point. 

Gunn is definitely gonna save the DCU though and I'm looking forward to some actual creativity being applied to stories like Superman.",2023-05-10

It gave me a sense of peace leaving that theater because most movies are too scared to take that risk but it's more common than not to not get what you want but things still working out in another way.

Forgive my ignorance. What are the traits of 70s sci-fi which resonated here? Could you please recommend some 70s sci-fi?,2023-05-22
Agreed on the 70s!  It was the movie they all wished they could make back then and early 80s.   I was blown away.  Easily one of the best MCU films,2023-05-21
I was screaming at something scary behind you.,2023-05-05

"Oh man, the horror imagery was something I wasn't expecting at all. They definitely pushed the boundaries of what they could do and I feel as though James Gunn wanted to see how far Disney/Marvel would let him go by using up as much of their budget on music licensing and also the extent of how creepy some of the creatures looked. Gamora peeling the guy's face off and the movie included the first ""fuck"" in the MCU felt like things that James Gunn wrote in to see whether they'd make him take it out (and they didn't).",2023-05-05

"Yeah, I think Gunn still would‚Äôve made it R if he was able to, especially because some of the dialogue felt like he wanted to include a bit more swearing.

"Gunn did the horror aspects better than raimi in MoM.

Gunn did the kid/dad aspect better than in love and thunder.",2023-05-08
"> And of course, probably the most satisfying scene in the whole movie, when Rocket shreds up the High Evolutionary's face for a solid 10 seconds, and at the end, when they tear away his mask and show just how much Rocket fucked him up

I really thought he was going to use the mask and rocket boots when he was in space because we hadn't seen them the entire movie,2023-05-05
"Gunn confirmed that due to the hectic beginning of the movie, Peter had to make snap decisions quickly and simply forgot/left the helmet behind on Knowhere. They never returned there for him to have the chance to pick it back up.

The boots were also confirmed by Gunn that Rocket made anti-grav boots for everyone that were all around just far superior and vastly more upgraded than Peter's old, misfiring rocket boots. They do the same thing Peter's old boots did but with added gravity functionality. Its why Rocket is ""testing"" the newest version of them at the start of the movie while talking to Nebula and why gravity was played around with so much during the movie. Its also one of the key ways Rocket kicks the High Evolutionary's ass at the end. He controlled gravity, so Rocket made anti-gravity boots to counter him. Also playing into the entire notion the High Evolutionary hates Rocket for being more creative/smarter/free thinking than he is. Rocket had years upon years of how to think about beating his ass... and he did so thoroughly.",2023-05-10
he even had the new uniform that has a cool helmet with it from the comics,2023-05-06
He answered this very question on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jamesgunn/status/1655344620681965568?s=46&t=0qG1fdiS0OXXZZgxL9DfHw,2023-05-08

"My guess is he ditched them because they reminded him of Gamora. Their first meeting he used the rocket boots to take her down, and his first selfless action was giving her his mask to survive in space.",2023-05-05
"James Gunn felt the need to explain this on Twitter today--Quill left his helmet in his apartment because he rushed out so quickly, and he stopped using the jet boots because the jet packs Rocket built for everyone worked so much better. It's a contrivance, but it's Word of God canon now.

His helmet broke in gotg2. Unsure about boots,2023-05-05
"Yeah it was a really weird scene because:
A) we'd already gotten a scene like this in the first film
B) he didn't have any of his normal gear
C) all his friends and allies seemed to be about 100 feet away and none of them had a spare jet pack to use",2023-05-07
"Idk about the boots, but masks in movies are important because you don't have to pay the star as much to be on set and have a stuntman fill in. Some people think that's why the Black Widow movie took so long to get made. No masks mean  more expensive movies. I'm thinking with this being the Gaurdians last hurrah, Disney's hands off approach, and Gunn's influence, the creative team didn't have to worry about needing to use a mask and wanted you to see the stars faces as much as possible.",2023-05-06
Seeing as rockets suit had the anti-grav suits I assume Quill's suit had too so not his rocket boots and the helmet could either be stored as a memory to yondu who gave him his first helmet or destroyed between movies,2023-05-06
Pawned them off for booze.,2023-05-06
"It was a face-off, not a trap.",2023-05-07
"I said this in another comment:

I also wondered about that but then remembered they all left Knowhere in a hurry to save Rocket

Whether that's the explanation or not, it's always a bit jarring to have those kinds of questions in a movie you otherwise lived so much.",2023-05-07
Others probably already gave Gunn's answer but the helmet was left back on Knowhere since he left the planet in a hurry to save Rocket and the rocket boots were no longer in use by Starlord as the jetpacks that were made by Rocket were a major upgrade/easier to control. The rocket boots essentially were retired.,2023-05-08
"Gunn addressed this. Peter had no time to get his helmet. 

HE woke up from his piss drunk stupor into a fire fight and was rushing off to save Rocket's life helmet be damned.

As for the boots he gave them up because Rocket already designed for him a superior jet pack.",2023-05-11

That was kinda the central crux of why the high evolutionary was screeching about rote memorization. Sure there is information in their heads but they can't use it to create anything new.,2023-05-05
"They seemed to just be a society from the 80s, maybe only a small percentage of them could create, kind of the same with regular earth in a way? Are we saying that anything that they had was basically just imported from earth on creation of the planet and that this is why they were still stuck in the 80s? Presuming HE started creating the inhabitants and the planet after Rocket escapes, that's got to be what at least 20 years ago?

Seemed to me HE's plan was flawed from getgo, eg ok he can make an initial set of ""perfect"" creatures, but then there isn't anything guaranteeing the offspring will have same characteristics, it's similar to a premise in another movie called I, Mother, AI tries to raise non-violent human, thinks it's done it, but nothing is guaranteed in terms of whether this first set of humans will be able to raise offspring the same way, let alone many generations down the line.

And did HE friggin clone or rapid growth those kids? Kidnap them? How did Drax speak same language? Either way HE was fucked up, and him getting his ass beat by all the Guardians ending with Gamora shanking him in a manner that he probably thought was imperfect was so satisfying.",2023-05-08

">in this a whole planet is blown up

I have to admit, that bothered me a little bit. Mostly because the characters didn't bother to acknowledge it. Millions of people were wiped out and the Guardians didn't bat an eye. They could have at least had the High Evolutionary plan an orbital bombardment to give the Guardians time to stop him, even if they failed -- which could have then built on the characters a bit. The film never really explored two key ideas which really could have funneled into this: firstly, that Gamorra meant something to everyone in the Guardians and that her return meant that they had to process their grief in new ways; and secondly that Peter's obsession with people dying around him meant that he would go to any lengths to save Rocket, even if it meant neglecting Counter-Earth.",2023-05-06

I could have done without that last minute random fakeout of Quill almost dying in space yet again though. That sort of came out of nowhere for me, it wasn‚Äôt super heroic and it‚Äôs been done before I thought. I didn‚Äôt think for a second he was going to die, so it just confused me.

"I mentioned in another comment that this movie kind of benefitted from James Gunn leaving Marvel after finishing this because I felt like there was no plot armor. There were a handful of times where at any given moment I felt a core member was in trouble and nope! they all made it out okay! but it didn‚Äôt feel cheap either because every character found a reason to keep going even if it meant retiring from the Guardians of the Galaxy. I was sure that Drax was as good as dead with how vocal Bautista has been about wanting to not have to stay in immense shape like that anymore as he gets older and how he was glad to be done with Drax, but nope! they just wrote him into a nice little gray area where he can either never come back or come back in a less significant way and not have to be so yoked. 

I am however very shocked to see Star-Lord will return. I was almost positive that Chris Pratt was going to make the jump to DC with James, but I‚Äôm eager to see what comes out of that. hoping it‚Äôs not a Disney+ show and if it is I hope it‚Äôs more Loki and less Ms. Marvel.",2023-05-06

We grieve for Starlord, but in a sense, Gamora got an ending that suited her much better. Now she's in a place where she can really use her talents and be appreciated for her badassery. Nebula needed empathy and love to really become who she was, Gamora needed respect and love. I never really felt like she was fully comfortable as she was when she was with Starlord. At the end of this one she seemed so happy and fulfilled, though. UGH. THIS MOVIE MAKES ME SO EMOTIONAL.",2023-05-10

I'd have to rewatch more closely to be sure, but I think it's possible that in the scramble to get off the ship, (only after making sure all the innocent animals were off, of course) someone might have carried him off.",2023-05-15

All he had to do was flick a little switch to completely nullify his power over him and turn the tide. To me it read like rocket had prepared that years ago just in case, and him being the better inventor of the two, like you said totally by chance in a one off experiment, shows rockets difference to the high creator, he doesn't need to win a big flashy way or anything more direct, because in many ways he had already won.

Like Rocket is a super genius so he probably counted them all like rainman and a box of toothpics and made sure the count was right.

"I knew they were all gonna die as much as I knew I was going to love them, and it was gonna hurt. Like, no doubt in me.",2023-05-05
"In the trailer there's a scene of Rocket and Lylla hugging, I figured that would come towards the end when you find out the 89 survived.

It made it all the more crushing when you see the hugging scene and what came after. My hopes were raised and dashed most masterfully.",2023-05-06

"I was kind of expecting Lyla to show back up, mindwashed or something equally fucked up that would still prevent rocket and her being together, or that rocket would be the one to die and Lyla might be the one we see the POV of...

was not expecting that :(",2023-05-06
I vaguely remembered the scene of Rocket and Lyla hugging from one of the trailers and thought that would be a scene of them reuniting on Counter-Earth in the present. It was not.,2023-05-15

I had to warn my sister. My nieces love guardians and of course especially Rocket (don't we all). And they also have a pet bunny.,2023-05-08
"100%. And Evolutionary face too. I was scared of Darth Vader face without helmet in Star Wars, but face without skin is much worse",2023-05-15
"That was a really good long take shot too. I think sometimes a movie will shoehorn in a oner so the director can show off, but that was really the best way to bring us into Knowhere and let us see what each of the guardians has been up to since we last saw them",2023-05-05
"One thing that really got me about the opening was how it could not have been more different than the opening of GOTG 2.

Vol. 2 starts with a loud, bombastic action sequence set to a high-tempo, high-energy song that keeps rolling even as our Guardians fight a seemingly impossible enemy and are in constant danger. At the end, they barely escape with their lives.

Vol. 3 starts with Rocket surveying normal, everyday life in Knowhere, ending with Quill violently drunk, yet again, to a slow and emotional acoustic track of a very sad song. At the end, Knowhere is mostly destroyed and they're all badly injured, including Rocket fighting for his life.",2023-05-05
And everyone dancing to Dog Days are Over was the perfect ending,2023-05-05
When that was how they opened the movie I immediately said to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be crying a lot aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù I really was not wrong,2023-05-05
"yeah, the Radiohead opening hit me like a fucking brick. Vol. 1 + 2 both have super fun energetic intros and then this movie started and I was like ‚Äú‚Ä¶fuck.‚Äù",2023-05-06
I love that it was the acoustic version,2023-05-05
Ending it with The Dog Days are Over was a great touch too. I loved Rocket and Groot dancing together and Drax dropping with the beat,2023-05-07

"Right as the song says ""creep"" James Gunn's title card comes on screen. I'm guessing he did that intentionally as a way to poke fun at himself for the twitter shenanigans.",2023-05-06

"That scene, already just the opener, was about to make me cry. I was like ‚ÄúSeriously, already?‚Äù",2023-05-06
I was crying through that entire sequence.,2023-05-06
"Eh, tbh I thought it was way too corny. This movie could've stood to use less music, in certain spots.",2023-05-06
I truly loved this film. It had some flaws but it had HEART and so it still triumphs for me.,2023-05-05
"It really feels like Feige and Marvel Studios let Gunn go 100% on this without interference. Little-to-no connection to the other films, the violence and action, the F-word, it‚Äôs like Disney/Marvel Studios apologized to Gunn for firing him and said ‚ÄúGo crazy!‚Äù",2023-05-05
100%. Gunn‚Äôs Guardians have always been special because he and the cast have poured their souls into their characters and it really makes an incredible difference. The MCU is going to be really empty with Gunn and the Guardians gone.,2023-05-05
And to think that Disney almost threw it all away. I‚Äôm glad they got James back but I can only imagine just how weird this movie would have been without him.,2023-05-05
"I think that‚Äôs the issue I noticed with a lot of the new MCU films‚Äî that the directors don‚Äôt care about the characters or the universe on a personal level.

For Taika Waititi, it worked in Ragnarok because Thor‚Äôs character needed a hard reset. But when it came to Love and Thunder, the fact that Waititi didn‚Äôt actually care for most of the characters showed clearly‚Äî only Jane and Gorr were handled with any real *care* throughout the whole movie.",2023-05-05
It's clear the DCU is in good hands with James Gunn.,2023-05-05
"Sadly, this may be the last MCU film that appealed to me",2023-05-05
Why does everyone just keep leaving Black Panther out? It's been like 6 months lol.,2023-05-06

"This puts faith in me about the next Justice League with James Gunn at the helm. The action, the air tight pacing and heartfelt stories. 

God, if WB don't fuck it up it'll be like the animated version of JL",2023-05-06
James Gunn man. Sucks he's leaving the MCU. I feel that DC will definitely benefit from his presence though.,2023-05-08
"Not to take anything away from the movie, but Gotg had 2 movies, a Christmas special and roles in other MCU films to develop their characters so this movie could focus on this story it told. It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt have magic and heart in other movies, but comparing them and the resolution of their story arcs won‚Äôt ever be a good measure.",2023-05-14
Really surprised on how many references there were to the Holiday Special. Casually dropping that Mantis was Quill‚Äôs sister must‚Äôve shocked a bunch of people who didn‚Äôt watch it.,2023-05-07
I couldn't make out what Peter said at all,2023-05-05
I wonder if people in the MCU would believe him since MCU earth has been invaded by aliens a few times.,2023-05-06
What were they saying in that scene? I couldn‚Äôt really make out the audio.,2023-05-05
"the other headline was about [""Lola the puggle""](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEqRFIdgHcW/?hl=en)

I think they should have had Kevin Bacon in the credit scene.,2023-05-08
"I know it was a funny scene and I wanted to laugh at it....but in my state, there's an infamous case of a woman's face being horribly disfigured by her pet gorilla. It's something you can't unsee.

Sorry to be a buzzkill, but that scene reminded me of that case. I'm sure I'm not the only one.",2023-05-07
We all have to make sacrifices lol,2023-05-05
Quill and Gamora going their separate ways was the right ending. Forcing them back together would‚Äôve felt like a cop out in a way. Their interactions in this one made them grow as people and move on to be new versions of themselves.,2023-05-05
"Given Gamora‚Äôs characterization in this movie and considering how long it took her to really warm up to Quill in the first movie, it would have definitely felt too forced",2023-05-05
"Plus it kinda doesn't make sense since this Gamora is not the Gamora we know, like a completely different person.",2023-05-05
"I love in a way how it is and isn‚Äôt. I was expecting a main character to die during this movie, but when they got near the end, I realized I wanted none of them too. They all have fantastic chemistry with each other. Truly feels like a family. 

So to see it end with them just pretty much saying ‚Äúsee ya later‚Äù was a nice change of pace. It‚Äôs the end of their story, but we will likely see them again if the universe really needs them",2023-05-05
"Quill matured to not have to rely on Gamora as a rock, and just this time the MCU has matured to not rely on killing beloved character(s) as an easy way to extract emotion from the audience once actors are done with their contracts.",2023-05-05
"I was surprised that they didn't have Gamora save him like he did in the first guardians of the galaxy.  

Also, it bugs me now, but where was his gear?  His boots and mask?  I would think he would have them on the ship or at least always on him?",2023-05-05
I also love that the Ravagers actually do love Gamora and we see them welcoming her back with open arms.,2023-05-05
Oh wow what an interesting way to have Gamora's Infinity War death matter,2023-05-05
And then seeing Gamora with the Ravagers like super happy. She found her people. She found her family.,2023-05-05
"Have Peter and Gamora end up together again would be character regression for Peter, so I'm glad he moved on .",2023-05-05
"Quill's response hit hard, man.",2023-05-05
"Yes it would have cheapened the impact of her death in Infinity War had they just brought them back as a couple. Instead, Gunn showed us ""they could end up together; their chemistry is still there"" but put them on different paths of life so that it will (probably) never happen.",2023-05-05
"Probably from a logistics standpoint they didn‚Äôt get together (Zoe Saldana not returning to the role, so she says) or it could be James Gunn not wanting the same cliche fairytale happy ending is my guess.",2023-05-05
I Would Have Really Liked Just Doing Laundry And  Saving The Galaxy With You,2023-05-06
"I was surprised when Gamora even came back to the crew, but pretty much knew they weren't going to end up back together. The Gamora Quinn and everyone knew and loved was gone and this new one wasn't her. What would it be trying to say by having Peter fall in love all over again with what's essentially a different woman. I'm sure it could be spun in some sweet way how Peter will her no matter what varient but I think it's infinitely sweeter that in all infinite multiverse of Gamoras Peter loved that one and only Gamora that he'll never be with again.",2023-05-05
"I kinda wanted that bit with Peter and Nebula to go a bit further, I think they could be cute together, but at the same time I can imagine that Nebula is still trying to get away from Gamora‚Äôs shadow and dating her kind-of ex would make that a little rough",2023-05-07
I honestly thought it was the obvious route they were gonna go only because of how hard theyve driven home that she's a different gamora. But it really felt satisfying the way it went down but his final reaction got me.,2023-05-05
Really seemed to be setting up him and nebula honestly,2023-05-05
"Too many movies do ‚Äúthe universe found a way to make it work‚Äù

‚ÄúThe universe gave me a chance at closure and moving on-‚Äú is better imo",2023-05-06
Loved that they showed Quill was wrong about Ravagers not being her family,2023-05-08
"But if Starlord is going to return, will that be Chris Pratt as Starlord or someone else?",2023-05-05
"I don't know what it is, but from watching this movie I did get a vibe that Gunn didn't want Gamora resurrected in Endgame.",2023-05-05
"I'm glad. The Gamora Quill knew and loved is dead. Him not getting with the ""new"" one means he has to fully except the death of ""his"" Gamora",2023-05-05
I was actually dreading them getting back together since Endgame. It just didn‚Äôt really make sense and gave me a weird vibe like him retraining her to be his girlfriend or something. I don‚Äôt know. It was handled really.,2023-05-06
Great goodbye quote to the Guardians movies overall. ‚ÄúI bet we were fun.‚Äù,2023-05-07
"""Oh you wouldn't believe it"" ü•∫üò≠",2023-05-05
I hated that she went back to the revengers and was so happy. She really seemed like she wanted to stay.,2023-05-07
"It's so good. Such a more adult and interesting take than the alternative (which, hey, I admit, I wanted too at first). Their arc can be read as a breakup metaphor, and Peter can't understand why Gamora doesn't love him anymore, Gamora can't force herself to feel something she doesn't feel, and in the end Peter accepts that he can look back on the good times, appreciate the fun they had, and move on with his life.",2023-05-11
It looked like Gamora thinks Nebs and Pete would make a good couple,2023-05-07
"This was what made me go from 'like' to 'love' for the movie. It's a very realistic ending for people who work hard and still don't end up with what they wanted but things working out in other ways. It gave me a sense of peace, personally.",2023-05-08
I went through a breakup months ago and it still hurts a lot. That line and really just all of the Peter and Gamora scenes just killed me. Going from being completely in love with somebody who also feels the same way to still being in love with them but they aren't anymore and it's as if none of what you went through ever mattered and they are a stranger really really fucking hit close to home. I was holding back ugly tears every time they interacted.,2023-06-19
Why would someone so handsome be interested in an ugly woman? I never understood that plot line.,2023-05-05
It‚Äôs great storytelling and an effective choice about letting go.,2023-05-05
What a wonderful scene,2023-05-05
"Yes, surprising but tit fits great in the series.  I really thought she would be drawn back into being a Guardian through Rocket's struggle and  backstory",2023-05-09
Man ended Kangs career in one line,2023-05-05
In a universe where gods are literally hanging out being jokes.,2023-05-05
Honestly it‚Äôs pretty cliche.,2023-05-05
"I really thought that was going to be when Thor showed up.

*Thunder/lighting clash* - ""Oh, yeah?  Say that to my face.  Sorry I'm late, guys"" - *Ass kicking scene*

Or something along those lines.

But who am I?",2023-05-05
Yeah. She was great in this. Glad she was finally able to shine. She's been a lot more comic relief until now.,2023-05-05
It‚Äôs the first MCU movie in a long time that looked and felt like a movie and not actors in a green screen doing the same plot structure with quips. Seeing this after Thor and Dr Strange is jarring and really shows how lazy the main MCU is since it‚Äôs not hard to imagine James gunns leverage over marvel got him the time to make the movie how he wanted since he was basically already done with the company.,2023-05-05
I love Mantis and Nebula‚Äôs sibling-like bickering!,2023-05-05
"I love that he's putting his GF in all of his movies now, she's great in them though!",2023-05-05
he really made the best mcu trilogy out of relative unknowns lmao. the dcu is about to be so fucking good,2023-05-05
Pom Klementieff getting to show off her chops before Dead Reckoning!,2023-05-05
Yes I was so happy they did more with her character beyond just one-liners,2023-05-05
"I'm glad they dialled down characters since that Christmas special. It was funny but they acted like psychos, especially Mantis.",2023-05-06
"You're right, this is one of the best acted MCU outings. There've been good plots and good special effects and good scenes, but rare is a superhero film so fully accomplished by all involved.

Good eye, and thanks.",2023-05-06
"Honestly, for me it's the opposite, I really liked that movie but most of characters felt flat imo. The same in the previous two GotG movies. Some of them are written well but other aren't, Drax being the best example. That's my impression especially after I played the game where all of them are truly amazingly written.",2023-05-07
The acting is insane. Just the banter and demeanors alone are so detailed,2023-05-10
"The villan wasnt so good though and warlock was so‚Ä¶.. yeah

But the core is very good",2023-05-05
I‚Äôm so glad the far left wasn‚Äôt successful in getting him canceled.,2023-05-06
Truth is thanos despised her weakness and was trying to raise her to be a perfect soldier. He was a very shit father but a father no less. Rocket on the other hand wasnt given anything comforting. His story was always one of the worst.,2023-05-07
"Even better that it was Nebula, who spent 5 years with Rocket after the snap as the only two guardians alive.",2023-05-06
"Yeah that was powerful as fuck. Nebula‚Äôs been defined by that and mentions it all the time, and it‚Äôs usually brought up in a ‚Äòthis is what my father done to me, what do you have to be sad about?‚Äô For her to realise Rocket had a worse deal was really huge.",2023-05-06
It reminded of the scene in Age of Ultron where everyone was weaving through eachother.,2023-05-05
That poor guy who got impaled in the thigh on the wall just reminded me of John Wick 4 when they get impaled to the wall. Pretty brutal action that was neat to see in GotG 3 and this hallway fight scene was definitely pretty glorious to watch them working as a team one last time.,2023-05-05
"Somewhere on earth at that moment, Matt Murdock smiled.",2023-05-06
To me without a doubt the best action scene in any marvel movie. That was the most perfect blend of actual actors and cgi that I have ever seen.,2023-05-08
i was like 'how they gonna beat all these dudes?' then they showed me exactly how,2023-05-06
"LOVED that! It wasn't just a 10 second scene, it was a good 5 minutes and everyone basically got to show off their skills like The AVengers did in the Battle of new york. Pure. Exhibition.",2023-05-06
"Extremely similar to some scenes from the videogame that came out in 2021 honestly, it's super fun",2023-05-06
With an impeccable soundtrack choice to match!,2023-05-05
It felt very guy richie - and i loved it,2023-05-05
"I got to so see this scene again once on digital.  Chaos everywhere, and the end had a messy room full of dismembered bodies.",2023-05-09
Are Marvel/Disney hallway fight scenes back on the menu?,2023-05-10
Best Marvel movie for a long time. Definitely one of my favorites now. Also probably the heaviest one,2023-05-10
Honestly that was a brilliant way to give the MCU its first official F-bomb.,2023-05-05
Pratt's delivery was hysterical.,2023-05-05
"Best use of the word ‚Äúfuck‚Äù haha

It‚Äôs been what 15 years since the MCU started and never once have we heard anyone say the fuck word until now. It was sort of a throwaway line but I‚Äôm not sure it would‚Äôve worked anywhere else in the film",2023-05-05
"James Gunn saw the door and decided to take Deadpool‚Äôs thunder

That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs James GOAT",2023-05-05
Hopefully it opens the fucking door for more,2023-05-05
"When I heard someone was gonna say ‚Äúfuck‚Äù in this movie, I was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt be some cringey ass delivery A La Dark Phoenix. I‚Äôm glad it was more of a comedic throwaway line.",2023-05-05
Yup perfect use of it - realistic frustration,2023-05-05
"Such a random moment made for maximum impact. It‚Äôs just so  funny, yet weirdly natural because the first ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be some epic moment. It should be as silly as ‚ÄúOpen the fucking car door‚Äù",2023-05-07
when was it?,2023-05-05
That caught me off guard lol,2023-05-05
"Man I don‚Äôt even remember it, it didn‚Äôt register like at all",2023-05-11
I didn‚Äôt even notice it! When was it!?,2023-05-05
I thought it would have been way better if right after Groot said I love you guys if someone just responded ‚Äúwhat the fuck did you just say‚Äù,2023-05-05
"Disagree, personally. Just unnecessary in my eyes. 

Not to be an old granny with her panties in a knot, but it feels like it was just put in for the sake of it. Seems like most found it funny though.

And I don't have a problem with swearing. I enjoyed Evil Dead Rise, for example.",2023-05-06
I don't know it felt forced to me. Like why did that scene need to happen just to make it official?,2023-05-20
But then they added too many after. Beastie Boys and multiple ‚ÄúShit‚Äù,2023-06-05
I wish they didn't put it in. I want my nephew to be able to watch these films.,2023-05-08
Same line and one time used in the movie 2012,2023-05-05
So funny man was shocked they did it.,2023-05-05
A flip in the first film and an f-bomb in the final film. Both are great.,2023-05-05
I saw it in german. Where was it used?,2023-05-05
What scene?,2023-05-06
"I think ""I (fucking) love you guys"" would have topped it",2023-05-07
"Twice actually! Once with the car door gag and another when Rocket‚Äôs otter friend was shot, she said, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ fuck‚Äù before falling down! I thought a PV-13 movie only gets one fuck! I guess that Disney money can buy anything!",2023-05-07
OPEN NA FUCKING NOOR,2023-05-07
It totally caught me off guard and it was hilarious.,2023-05-07
Even the guys getting electrocuted fit the beat,2023-05-05
The shot of Rocket in the air shooting downward during the battle was excellent.üëè,2023-05-05

"I know some people don‚Äôt like 2 as much but I think all 3 are excellent. Cream of the MCU crop. 

I can‚Äôt decide where I‚Äôd put this one either - but it‚Äôs battling for the top spot. Need to see it again to confirm.",2023-05-05
No Sleep Till Brooklyn is gonna be stuck in my head all night lol,2023-05-05
"For me it's fairly easy, it's 1 - 3 - 2. There were enough flaws in 2 that I was somewhat disappointed, but it was still really good, we were holding it to the standard of vol 1. 

Vol 1 is just too good, and I thought this one was spectacular. In terms of MCU overall, I think it's now my top 5:

GotG1

GotG3

Winter Soldier

Ragnarok

Endgame",2023-05-05
"It helps that it‚Äôs the only one that‚Äôs really a trilogy. The rest are really just movies that feature the same character, a la James Bond. 

* Iron Man - 2 different directors, but this is probably the closest to a true trilogy. 
* Cap - 2 directors. One is a period piece, one is a spy movie, and one is an Avengers 
crossover
* Thor - 3 different directors, all wildly different tones and unrelated stories
* Spider-man - same director, but the 3rd one is a 3-way crossover more than a sequel
* Avengers - 2 different directors and they‚Äôre all sequels to the Phases rather than to each other.

GOTG and Iron Man are the only ones you can mostly watch on their own, without crossovers. Gamora is the obvious exception, but otherwise this trilogy tells a single, continuous story unlike the other ones.",2023-05-05
Captain America?,2023-05-05
I think the first one is still the best but I liked this one better than 2 so 2nd place for me.,2023-05-05
"I'm probably in the minority but i love Iron Man 1 and 3, and 2 is a weird love-hate relationship. But a fantastic trilogy imo.",2023-05-05
"Frankly, I'll say it, it's top 3 Marvel movies for me. 

The sheer emotional weight behind the movie, coupled with the great action, acting, sets and music, and how it not only concludes each person's arc but gives them a proper reason for splitting up to discover themselves is absolutely brilliant. I believe this is so far the only Marvel movie that made me tear up, and that says a lot. 

I wouldn't put it at number 1 overall best Marvel movie but it is certainly the best of the trilogy (but all 3 are easily the best MCU movies to come out)",2023-05-07
"if I had a nickel for every time a space sci-fi adventure movie had a big action setpiece towards the end at the tune of the Beastie Boys, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.",2023-05-05
People really do be sleeping on the Captain America trilogy,2023-05-06
The Cap trilogy was good.,2023-05-05
My entire theater was audibly gasping in awe during that scene,2023-05-05
Definitely had that avengers 1 action sequence showcasing everyone. Was delightful.,2023-05-06

They should have used ‚ÄúBodysnatchers‚Äù, since it would be a nice call back to ‚ÄúCreep‚Äù (being that they are both Radiohead songs and they are part of a long-take), and it foreshadows who the Long Evolutionary actually is.",2023-05-05
I wouldn't say that it was consistently good because second was bad.,2023-05-07
They tastefully covered up the ‚Äúclassy ho‚Äôs‚Äù line too.,2023-05-07
"The beginning of that fight is the best part.  The music kicks on, they all start walking towards their inevitable deaths in slow motion and Gamora is just standing there like ""what the fuck is wrong with you people"".",2023-05-08

She's angry because she's an empath.  She's been soaking up all of the guardian's anger.  She's not argumentative on her own, she's yelling because they all yell at each other.

"> This is what made the MCU great. 

gonna be honest, I can't get past this feeling that we're all going to look back at this as when the MCU really kind of stopped being good.

Like there'll be some good movies here and there obviously; they make three a year they can't all stink, and I think people tend to exaggerate how bad they've been getting.

Might be a good way to introduce Nova as well. Richard Rider. The last of the Nova corps, exiled on a distant planet since the destruction of Xandar.",2023-05-05
"I am curious what they have planned for Warlock, Because I will be honest, I do not really need or want any more Guardians movies. I feel like this was a perfect ending for the group as a whole and while I have no problem with them showing up now and again, I don't think we really need to focus on them anymore. 

Plus as you said, Adam is probably too big of a character to be stuck in a group for very long, so I am sure he will start making his way soon enough. But will he get his own series or mostly stay as a background character in the rest of the cosmic MCU stuff?

I am not super familiar with any comics where he is the lead, so I don't actually know how much there is to Warlock as a character.",2023-05-05

well you can thank Alan Horn for that because Vol. 2‚Äôs ending was very much heading into the direction of him being the villain until Gunn was fired and this movie was delayed forever. I think they still did a great job with dealing with the consequences of Vol. 2 and Infinity War/Endgame though.

"While it is as good movie as we could have hoped for, I would not start the praises with a villain.

He is forgettable C tier level villain here. He did not feel threatening enough, he did not seem in control, he just screamed a lot which is the cheapest approach to make audience react as if he is scary. He could not even control his own leadership, he begged like a bitch when defeated. And his whole operation is apparently defeatable by some b-tier ravagers left behind that have ship with a canon and 3 minutes notice...   but I guess one should write shitty villain when the main attribute is unnecessary torture of cute animals... would be a waste of good material on such character, better save it.

Warlock was ok, but he needed at least 2 more scene to underline his child mind IMO.",2023-05-07

I dont fully agree. Feige let Raimi and Taika free reign and the result were fun, but shallow and meaningless movies that ultimately disappointed (at least: me). Gunn gets the overall nature of the MCU and how to tell a story in that way. Give us emotions, give us fun, give us consequences.

The MCU lost so much momentum after Endgame - we went from every film tying together and clearly building up to something bigger, right back to the start with a collection of unconnected movies (and having lost the biggest of the marvel characters as a draw).

Groot and Gamorah have already died so there isn't much sense killing them again.

I thought for sure one would die (my money was on Drax) but after watching the film I see a random death would have just been distracting and made the movie all about mourning the dead character when the movie was already about accepting the Old Gamora is gone.

There is no crossover plot-line or any semblance of over arching plot even in the other Phase 4 Marvel movies and they are still mediocre. I think it all just comes down to James Gunn having full control over the trilogy with a beginning and an end.,2023-05-06
"HE is also sort of like the Forerunners in Halo, killing all life then reseeding it, which itself was also inspired by Noah's Ark. Hell, the main installation that can fire the Halo's and is out of range of them is literally called ""The Ark"".

They were arrogant af and thought themselves better than other species, but unlike HE, they didn't create them and only killed them (and most of themselves) because they exhausted every other option against the Flood. Between getting infected by the flood and a painless death, I'll take the painless death.

(Yes I know the Forerunners *technically* caused the Flood outbreak because they killed the Precursors and used their corrupted dust on their pets or something (343's storytelling....), but the Flood outbreak is more karmic retribution than something they intended on).",2023-05-20
"Honestly, I can understand it not being there.

This is set in the same year as Endgame, which was 5 years after Infinity War. Except Peter got snapped, so Gamora died, he died, came back, saw another Gamora that rejected him, and claims they never met.

I also imagine the mask is rare or hard to come by, so  if it broke between Endgame and now, it wouldn't get replaced given Peter's mental state.",2023-05-20

The second type of influence comes from the people who guide and direct you throughout your life. These could be mentors, teachers, friends, or even strangers who offer advice or assistance. This is considered the ""hand that guided the hand.""

Essentially, the quote is saying that while your creator has a significant impact on your life, it is the people who guide and support you that help shape you into the person you become. It acknowledges the role of both nature and nurture in shaping a person's life and character.",2023-05-13

When they ended the movie with that song from the first movie (""Come and Get Your Love""), that was when I knew that the filmmakers themselves believed the movie was sh_t, and they were using every cheap trick in the book to try to please the audience.

Peter Quill dies in outer space and we see the tissues in his face and skull starting to explode from the pressure differential... then his dead body is brought inside. Then he wakes up and makes a joke. What is the point of that? So many pointless things in this movie.

Reddit owners DEFINITELY getting some financial love from the studios with the way comments are getting voted in this thread! What a joke. I'm glad I've switched from reddit to twitter, mostly.

I had low expectations for this movie and I STILL didn't enjoy it that much. The villain was interesting, but the filmmakers drew our attention away from the villain's motivations. He wanted to use science and genetic experiments and a kind of totalitarian control, to create a ""better"" society. That's really interesting. Where does that come from, were the filmmakers borrowing this from an old comic book? I wish the movie had explored this idea a whole lot more; as it is, it's barely mentioned.

Have Marvel movies gone downhill since Stan Lee's passing?

The flashbacks  actually expand upon Rocket's character and let us know why he is the way he is.

I personally thought the scene where Adam incinerates that guy was unneeded gore, lol.",2023-05-11
"My interpretation was that thanos surgeries were advanced and professional at the very least and used proper cybernetics that would be considered an upgrade. On the other hand the High Evolutionarys labs were grungey and underground, he was just haphazardly adding shit to see what happened to work not caring about the consequences.",2023-05-13
I think that part with Nebula‚Äôs eyes was improv by Pratt. I do see where you‚Äôre coming from though.,2023-05-15
"I had the exact same thoughts while watching . The  cuts were so jarring and it legit reminded me of rise of skywalker. Too many plot lines with different emotional elements. Sad backstory, cut to comedic drax, cut to action filled Peter/groot etc. it was just so all over the place lol",2023-05-05
">The story was rather sloppy and reminded me of rise of skywalker (we gotta go here and get this thing! Oh wait, that didn‚Äôt work, now we gotta go over there and get that thing!).

'And then....' which per South Park creators is a cardinal sin in screenwriting.",2023-05-07
I ain‚Äôt reading all that I‚Äôm happy for you tho or sad that happened,2023-05-05
"It's garbage. I'm shocked people are receiving this film well. The entire story is one McGuffin after another, and plot of ""we fight but we're family"". Felt like same script writers as Fast and Furious. 

Oh you think this character is about to die? Nope.",2023-05-27
lol I thought about doing the same but I went to a theater with the luxury recliners and I was tired so I let myself doze off a bit,2023-05-07
The movie in my opinion does not really start until 1:40:00 when we finally get some rocket action...,2023-08-05
That's the way I took it too.,2023-05-07
"Another commenter has said that James Gunn has confirmed that to be correct. Idk if he actually has, but another commenter said it, so there is that",2023-05-07
"Yeah, it didn‚Äôt sit right with me either. To me at least, the whole underlying theme of the Guardians series is the idea of ‚Äúfound family‚Äù. These people are all ‚Äúlosers‚Äù, having lost their families and homes, but they found a new one with the team. So the idea that they all willingly decide to go their separate ways just seems off. Peter and Mantis in particular felt odd since they had both just discovered that they are literal family, but decided to leave for very flimsy reasons. 

All in all the idea of the team breaking up felt forced, and not really in line with the characters up to this point.",2023-05-07
"Peter is just going home for a while, Mantis wants to find her own way but it's not like she won't keep in touch, Nebula is in charge of the GotG HQ and Drax is raising kids there.  The only ones to leave outright are Mantis and Peter.  And Gamora died in Endgame.  This version found family with the Ravagers.",2023-05-08
"It felt really contrived for several of them at once to start saying that they were going to leave. Quill, and then Mantis says uhh me too. And Nebula all of a sudden wants to be a caretaker? Since when? Felt like a hurried way to break them up.",2023-05-08
It‚Äôs not like the Guardians could stop the mass destruction of Counter-Earth at any point. The HE already wanted to do it and just pulled the trigger then.,2023-05-08
"I see it as - they saved who they could. Including random animals

They couldn't save Counter-Earth, but then they tried to redeem themselves by saving everyone on HE's ship",2023-05-08
Replace Kang with HE.,2023-05-08
Still thinking about it 3 days later. I want to watch it again soon while also I never want to see it again.,2023-05-08
"Ethically speaking, we have always considered a difference between killing someone who is an active threat to your life and killing an already defeated opponent for revenge. The latter arguably being a 'war crime' if you imagine executing captured enemy combatants. Seriously, it's a big no-no. I don't know why people have taken to ignoring that.

But in any case... I kinda interpreted it more like it would be a more fitting punishment to leave him alive, powerless, with his influence eroded, his minions killed, his experiments freed so he's only able to watch as the messy, imperfect universe he hates so much flourishes without him. But Idk.",2023-05-08
"While I always have an issue with that mentality I assume it is because in that moment he was helpless and not an immediate threat. The others he killed were actively trying to kill them so it was defensive. Killing someone is fine as long as they are trying to kill you, not fine if they are just laying there waiting to die.

It shouldn't matter what they are currently doing if they are a genocidal maniac that makes torturing entire species a passtime, but they make a distinction based on situation.",2023-05-08
I'm sure he gets blown up along with his ship though lol,2023-05-08
that pissed me off. he should have just fucking  blasted him,2023-05-08
"Meh the High Evolutionary was basically a goner at that point bring stabbed by a giant sword by Gamora. He was basically immobile and helpless. He ain't getting off that ship. 




Rockets never really killed anyone that was helpless, the only one we've seen do that is probably Gamora and Nebula.",2023-05-09
"I wish they did that, but that likely shows language competency that Drax doesn't possess.",2023-05-09
He's also the lead agent in Gunn's Peacemaker show.,2023-05-16
"I thought ""Oh, shit, Rocket has the Zune, is Pete already dead?""",2023-05-16
"I agree with almost all of your points. The movie was solid and better than a lot of recent MCU projects, but I don‚Äôt love it as much as some others do. Few of the jokes landed for me as well. The previous movies had moments that had me laughing out loud, while this movie only managed to get a few chuckles out of me. I don‚Äôt think the movie necessarily needed a death, but I was surprised there wasn‚Äôt one at all. I appreciated the darker elements and Rocket‚Äôs backstory, but the rest of the movie only pretty good for me. This was not the return to form for Marvel that I was hoping it would be, and that others are claiming it is.",2023-05-05
"He might have just been on a emotional bender? 
The woman you love is dead... ohh and here is the woman you love but before she met you so its a constant reminder that you could have her but she is gone! 

If one is responsible enough one can get drunk and let it loose to allow emotion to be free.",2023-05-06
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the biggest deal. He‚Äôs basically forced out of it because he‚Äôs on a two day time crunch to save rocket who is his best friend and basically all he has left,2023-05-07
"Agreed.  The emotional beats in the film hit with all the subtlety of a wet noodle.  Gunn is a proficient director but he's not good (some people seem to think proficient and ""good"" are the same thing).",2023-05-09
Definitely agree to an extent. They picked the cutest baby animals,2023-05-09
"Aren't all movies emotionally manipulative? The choices of shots, actors, lighting, and music are all purposeful to make us feel a certain way.",2023-05-09
"Idk, thought the 'flaws' are the most important characteristics to the gaurdians as a whole. The characters are so flawed to the point they aren't even honorable heroes, just a common family with common family problems, and that's where a lot of people including me relates to. Imho the movie kinda resembled family road movies where the whole cast screams at each other about how someone hates others but ends up rediscovering their love or stuffs like that. Guess I'm a bit biased tho.",2023-05-06
"I disagree completely, if Gunn would have made a third film exactly the same way as volume 2 it would have sucked, the series needed a conclusion and that‚Äôs the beauty of movies you can always rewatch what you like",2023-05-06
Kind of weird to single out James Gunn for the third movie while ignoring he also wrote and directed the first two Guardians movies you enjoyed.,2023-05-05
"How is Ronan worse?  The High Evolutionary created species and granted creatures higher intelligence and just killed them all because he wasn't happy with his results. He pretended to be a benevolent biologist but only did it to feed his ego

Ronan was (IIRC) seeking revenge on Xandar for a war that killed multiple generations of his family.",2023-05-06
Absolutely. And they didn‚Äôt even kill anyone like they promised,2023-05-06
"I liked it a bit more than Vol. 2 but not as much as Vol. 1. YMMV. The scenes that apparently made 99% of the people in this sub cry did not really land with me at all, and I would have liked more humor towards the end of the movie.",2023-05-05
Screentime of large cast huge improvement than GotG 2 aswell as retain multiple storylines.,2023-05-05
"Will you be rewatching in theaters or at home?

"I was thinking the same thing. Also, in the first two movies wasnt he shown to be super powerful.",2023-05-06
My wife was thinking like gamora we‚Äôve been around groot enough we understand him.,2023-05-06
"He was shot twice.  First in the chest, second in the back.",2023-05-07
he wanted his brain. Rocket was the only person to have creative thinking. None of his other creations were able to think critically. He said they have genetic memory brains. Like a computer they can remember things. But lack critical thinking and creativity. Like rocket was always creating weapons and tools.,2023-05-06
"The High Evolutionary sees Rocket as nothing more than a prototype. To him, Rocket is an ugly, messy creation bolted together with crude tech, and Rocket can't even talk right. HE is seeking perfection and Rocket isn't. There's no place in the HE's vision of utopia for living mistakes.

But Rocket's brain does something none of the other creations do. The villain wants that factor added onto beings that 'look' right and speak right. Floor and Teefs don't seem to be as smart as Rocket, so they don't even have that going for them. I think Lylla is arguably very emotionally intelligent but HE wouldn't value that.

It's just the way High Evolutionary sees things. Rocket almost *disgusts* him.",2023-05-06
It broke in Vol. 2,2023-05-07
The latter. The characters don‚Äôt react.,2023-05-07
"[It's the second one, as confirmed by James Gunn](https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1654740982020321280).",2023-05-07
Swol Groot. And he expanded his vocabulary by 3 additional words,2023-05-07
"I think what he meant was Rocket was the only one who could create without him giving them the knowledge how to create it. He helped create Adam, like gave them instructions or something on how to do it and they did it. But for Rocket, not only did he figure out something without the help of the high evolutionary, he even figured out something the high evolutionary could not solve.",2023-05-07
"Well depends on your perspective, High Evolutionary killed everyone on that planet he made lol.",2023-05-07
"The scene in the corridor where her neck breaks, and she kills a couple of grunts whilst snapping her neck back into place was incredible.",2023-05-07
He was so good. Better than Kang in AM3 imo.,2023-05-07
they were also all of a sudden all beat to shit after the explosion. Im pretty sure their was a fight scene in there they just cut for time.,2023-05-07
Very weird but I guess they felt they really needed to explain how they escape. Personally could have just cut that scene and have them show up on the octopus dudes and I would have accepted it lol,2023-05-07
"Yup. 

From the opening frames, I knew I would be in love with this film. It was literally love at first sight for me.",2023-05-08
"High Evolutionary is extremely intelligent but not invulnerable. As we‚Äôve seen, he really struggles in fights where he doesn‚Äôt have an immediate upper hand. Also, he has so many grunts and underlings that he can use before having to get his hands dirty. He could have eventually captured Rocket with this strategy if he had not lost his cool.",2023-05-08
"This is a case where the High Evolutionary, despite being the boss bad guy, isn't the physically strongest and isn't invulnerable. Rocket fucked his face up once already, yeah no shit he'd send Warlock or big mecha-pig to do the dirty work for him. Why put yourself at risk again?

HE's power comes from intelligence and influence. So...use that.",2023-05-08
"So the movie can happen. 

Wow wow wow.     Wow",2023-05-08
"I knew just from the trailer what was going to happen to Rockets friends, but I didn't expect it to hit me like it did.  Just seeing what was done to an innocent soul like Floor at all choked me up every time, but then hearing their panic during that scene, and the utter silence after gutted me.  I'm still not ok :(",2023-05-09
They all tried to kill each other in the first film. Nebula did so many times over. It's kind of the shtick of this team.,2023-05-09
"Arguably what Adam did isn't remotely as bad as Peter attacking Thanos at a crucial moment and actually getting half of everyone killed. Yet that didn't seem to have repercussions.

Warlock was just created and doing it to protect his people from being eradicated. If anyone would understand it would be the Guardians.",2023-05-09
"They get targeted from death by like half of the galaxy, they're housing the collector in their HQ planet. They don't really take it personally.",2023-05-09
"I felt like Adam was a bit shoehorned in. In terms of balancing the plot he either needed more screen time to get a proper arc or be cut. 

I really enjoyed when he was on screen but none of it was necessary.",2023-05-17
"I feel like Nebula or Gammorah shrugging off his ""born to be a weapon"" thing would have made sense. But no one ever really had a conversation with the guy so yeah, it doesn't make a whole ton of sense.",2023-05-10

"The goats didn't leave with the Guardians, and I don't know why Taika Waititi said they did. The goats were with Thor, Jane, and Valkyrie later in Thor 4, during the black-and-white scenes, way after the Guardians leave.",2023-05-11
I hated the goats. Hope the guardians had a mutton dinner,2023-05-13
The only thing I felt from that was annoyed when it didn't progress Warlock's character,2023-05-22
"When they are getting in the car on Counter-Earth. After telling Nebula to push the button and then she asks what next, Peter says ""open the fucking door"".

I think you missed a very key point there with Groot. He says ""I love you guys"" and none of the characters reacted as it being anything other than his normal ""I am Groot"" phrase. We, as the audience, got a glimpse of understanding Groot's language.",2023-05-22
"Yeah, that part of the movie felt like it needed to be much longer or not exist at all. Just to show off how evil High Evolutionary is I guess, but nearly every one of his creations besides Rocket and Warlock have zero personality besides dumb or being a mindless drone.",2023-05-24

Who tf hates the guardians soundtracks???,2023-05-06
you are entitled to your opinion but the only thing I agree is the soundtrack.  there were some good songs but it was underwhelming this time.  creep was a perfect fit for rocket.  loved no sleep in brooklyn sequence but it would impossible to top the magic of mix tape #1,2023-05-05
This,2023-05-06
"> like huh? Of all the races, creatures, worlds, civilizations, you specifically chose Earth?

Thank you!!,2023-05-06
">Granted it wasn't as bad as the first two films but man, these tracks just do not work and reinforce the ""human centered"" universe trope.

Thats the whole fuckin point lmao. The awesome mixes are songs that peter quill like, and of course, since hes human, theyll be human songs. I mean its played on a god damn walkman ffs",2023-05-14

People can have different opinions.,2023-05-07
"I completely agree with your criticisms here. I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but it just lacked a lot of what made the first two so enjoyable. The chemistry amongst the group just wasn't the same, in large part because Rocket is normally such a big part of it and helps tie Groot in. The music didn't work nearly as well; they were all over the place in terms of era and vibe. I don't think anybody in the world has ever danced hard to the beginning of ""Dog Days"" the way Groot did; felt really forced. You mentioned the trope of almost reaching heaven... how about the trope of the surprise bullet in the back just when everything seems great? The flashbacks as a whole felt very predictable and manipulative and not in the spirit of the franchise.",2023-05-07
"I don‚Äôt agree with every point you made, but I‚Äôm glad you wrote out your thoughts for me to read :)",2023-05-07
"I agree with a lot of this. I also did NOT like the choice they made regarding Gamora and Quill's relationship in the end. I think having her be in the entire movie sets it up for them to at least crack open the door to rekindling in the future. If they were not going to, then I would have rather had her only show up for like one act of the movie. Their final lines to each other were just like utterly depressing. And it left me feeling very sad in the end, which is not how i wanted to leave this movie. Just feeling depressed. ESPECIALLY since everyone keeps saying ""this is a happy ending and a great sendoff for these characters."" Like. What? The band breaks up and everyone goes off to reflect on their pain. How the fuck is that a happy ending? It would be a GREAT ending IF there was a fourth and final movie coming where they band up again. But as it sits, this movie's ending is fucking  depressing, and apparently thats it for this group. Ugh that was not the ending i was hoping for.",2023-05-07
Completely agree about the screaming. It‚Äôs annoying because the movie wants you to think it‚Äôs funny.,2023-05-07
"I agree with every point you made, though I would go so far to say that it was not a good movie to me. I loved the first movie, I thought the second was alright even if the emotional beats didn't really land for me, but I felt checked out of Vol. 3 in the first half-hour.

I don't know how people give such high praise to Bradley Cooper when he's unconscious for most of the movie, and it's a baby CGI version in flashbacks with the most sacrificial friend characters that I can think of. Just very cheap emotionally and sad moments with animals always get me in movies. The tone was all over the place and never had time to breathe.

Side note: I found it hilarious at the end when the Evolutionist guy screams over the radio to his city-sized spaceship for everyone to get Rocket and it ends up being like 30 dudes in a hallway",2023-05-13
"totally agree. the tone was unclear. the movie was trying to be very dark and grim, and then they'd have drax make a ""joke"" about his poop. Felt so fucking  forced and strange",2023-05-08
"Which is odd considering the Sovereign were made by the High Evolutionary, he could have played a more serious and relatable role besides wanting to arrest Rocket the whole time.",2023-05-05

It‚Äôs all fake cgi,2023-05-05

"Found it very strange too, it clashes a lot with the rest of the movie (even if they are wild invasive animals, it doesn't really matter), especially when the ending was about saving children and animals. They could have done a different mission instead. Or maybe Rocket finds smart solutions to fix the issue without killing them. Very odd indeed.",2023-05-06
Sums up how I feel. The death of Rocket's friends is so obvious and there are multiple death fakeouts which I knew were definitely not going to be real and would feel dumb if they actually were.,2023-05-08
I want to go rewatch it but i think it would have been a better movie without the gamora thread. SHe contributed nothing and had no arc.,2023-05-08
Honestly villains right now are overly saturated with overly relatable and sympathetic villains that have some sort of backstory attached. It‚Äôs refreshing to see the trope turned on its head just like it was in puss in boots 2 with jack horner. Sometimes just having an evil bastard that needs to die is a refreshing take. Also it set up a great team up ‚Äúfight‚Äù where they just fuck him up before leaving him for dead.,2023-05-14
"It was better than I thought.  But you want to talk about the high evolutionary?  I don't think that you will like what I have to say, it's not positive, regarding him.  

In my opinion, he should have either had a more face concealing mask, or leaned more into being a religious zealot. If you are going to change the costume, then make it more religious.  Maybe a better actor could have done better job, or looked visually more like some sort of priest.  While an expressionless metal facemask would have been more of a blank slate.",2023-05-05

"For me, the 2nd one is the worst of the three, because it falls into the Marvel trope of the villain just being a bigger, badder version of the hero.

That's been THE thing since Iron Man/Iron Monger.

Guardians 1 was a breath of fresh air.

Guardians 3 is also in that the stakes are so low. HE doesn't care about ruling or destroying the galaxy. Nothing would fundamentally change if he got Rocket back or not, other than the Guardians would lose their friend.

Compared to the typical cut and paste Marvel movie, this one had more heart than the rest of them put together.",2023-05-16

"The mutiny scene was good and felt natural to me, you just completely misunderstood it.

"> but the scene where the villain says there's no god and then the entire crew decides to mutiny him for saying that made me cringe hard. Atheism doesn't deserve that sort of unnecessary prejudice. 

You might want to check your own narrative and then rewatch that scene. You are DEFINITELY seeing this scene through your own worldview, not Gunn's.

If we're gonna pull our bonafides out, I too am an Atheist. But I am also an MCU fan so apparently I need to remind you that *gods* have been a part of the MCU since the first Thor film. Natasha literally says of Loki & Thor that they are ""basically gods."" 

**Not that that matters for this scene.** If every one of those minions was a rant on r/Atheism all day long, hard core atheist they still would have mutinied when their leader proclaims himself a god in response to their concerns that the mission is being jeopardized by his person fixation of Rocket and the real reason he pursues him is NOT for his brain but simple, crude, stupid revenge. 

In short, they tried to kill him for being an egotist about to get them all killed for nothing. He doesn't just say there is no god, he proclaimed himself to be it. And many gods proclaim they are the one, true god. The others are just pretenders. Hence the use of ""no god"" addressed to a group only means the one *they* worship/fear/love.",2023-05-07

The villain was obsessed with perfectionism. For me personally I didn't need any backstory on him (there's already plenty with Rocket and Gammorah that shouldn't be distracted from). To throw in a villain arc would have overbloated the film.,2023-05-10

Do we really need a clever twist or character curveball in the end of a trilogy and presumably end of the franchise? I can‚Äôt think of a movie under that scenario where that‚Äôs happened.

‚Ä¢ Everyone seemed to be either chill, or angry out of nowhere. Why did ‚Äûemotional‚Äú = ‚Äûangry‚Äú if a character started elaborating on his feelings? Since when does Mantis shout at people [so much]? Same goes for gamora. Nebula kinda always had this pissy attitude, but it‚Äôs still so silly. They just raised their voices and yelled if they wanted to get their point across

‚Ä¢ why the fuck would they discuss at length, that they should leave the exploding ship, if they didn‚Äôt wanna die. Then rocket goes ‚Äûno more turning back‚Äú and EVERYONE just turns around and seem to immediately forget the looming threat that they JUST discussed seconds before, and follow rocket on a revenge killing spree/ freeing spree? 

So much forced emotions in this movie. barely anything felt natural

‚Ä¢ Also apparently it was ok for starlord to request for backup from his homie with the giant skull-ship, only for them to get absolutely wrecked, as soon as the station docked. Why did starlord get off of this so easily? He KNEW what danger he was sending them into and still called for them. Felt like they could do anything just because they (the guardians) had some weird higher motif with saving rocket. So fucking soulless towards the habitants of that space station. insane",2023-05-07

"This might be tl;dr but you‚Äôre not alone - I was thinking the same about myself being the one who‚Äôs tired. Never been a massive marvel movie fan, but I loved Guardians, and while this was entertaining and I enjoyed it I felt confused by the amount of praise it received as one of the ‚Äòbest Marvel movies ever‚Äô. It‚Äôs got loveable rogues, it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs a gut punch, it combines elements well. But I don‚Äôt really understand how it does anything beyond the scope of other pre-existing material - at one point Drax even says ‚Äòtry picking on someone your own size‚Äô and it‚Äôs like... for a movie praised for its characters, they still need the old cliches? I get that its aimed at a wide audience and it can‚Äôt be overly complex, but it felt like where it thrived was in its smaller situations (The Creep intro, Quill venting about his relationship to a hostage, dinner with bat humans, etc) and not the large scale big baddie stuff. The Rocket stuff was well done, and obviously was key to the story, but it also felt like it was removing the pace. The general plot around Rocket was basically 101 Dalmations but instead of a fur coat it‚Äôs a civilisation. Elements like the Warlock felt unnecessary and like he existed as a Deus-Ex Machina for Quill at the end. Visually, I don‚Äôt think anything was as uniquely arresting as the opening from Guardians 1, but the multicoloured spacesuits were cool. It just didn‚Äôt really subvert expectations and I don‚Äôt get what makes it noteworthy. I think because they tried to cram so much in, rather than a final instalment to send the characters off it felt like getting tiny fragments of them. It almost felt like it should have been a tv show, so every character could have more focus before we could see the results of their experiences and teamwork with a different lens. I don‚Äôt know if that lines up with what you experienced, but just thought I‚Äôd share. I did really enjoy it but not enough to be like wow amazing. It makes me wonder wtf the other marvel movies are like if this is one of the best",2023-05-07
"Well, they didn't ""give"" him one, it was being forced upon them. 

Alan Horn's bone-headed reactionary decision to fire Gunn (for something they were already aware of) did not go over well in both the Guardians cast, Marvel (Feige was totally against it, but he saw that Horn had made his decision so it was dangerous to fight it, not after Horn & Iger made Ike Pearlman irrelevant to Marvel Studios operations) and Disney. But it also upset not just the fans, but many in the industry thought it was a bitch ass response to what was a coordinated take down move from the Right against Gunn. It was just going to encourage them to keep bullying Hollywood over issues. 

Horn rehired Gunn to save face. Bautista was letting it be known that he would only do the required minimum of his contract and after that would be gone from the MCU (Bautista and Pratt's reactions to Gunn's firing is a study in what true loyalty looks like.

Even though they‚Äôve been in five movies together at this point (and a cameo in Thor 4), their ending seems very premature.

I‚Äôm not wild about the Gamora plot line in general either. Maybe they‚Äôre setting it up for a Warlock and Gamora love interest, but Gamora in this is kind of a bitch. Even in GOTG 1 she wasn‚Äôt this stubborn and obnoxious. I would have added a scene where Kraglin gives advice to Peter (‚Äòshe‚Äôs not your Gamora‚Äô) and Gamora (‚Äòhe had a special thing with the other you, you don‚Äôt have to like him but try to understand his situation‚Äô) separately and he helps them both accept the other‚Äôs situation.

"I really, REALLY do not understand all the praise for the villain in this film.  I came to this thread expecting a lot of bitching about him and instead one of the highest comments is praising him over and over again.  Easily the worst villain in the entire MCU apart from whatever the hell Mickey Rourke‚Äôs character was in Iron Man 2.  

All this villain did was scream and yell and throw tantrums.  It made zero sense for a dude they tried to build up as this ultra intelligent dude playing god.  One of the worst on screen performances I‚Äôve seen, and that‚Äôs partly on Gunn and partly on the actor.  I guess redditors just think that screaming your fucking head off on camera makes for good acting?

Minor nit, I was kind of disappointed in the soundtrack on this one.  Song titles were all over the place in era and genre, it made sense with volume 1 being his mom‚Äôs favorite songs, and then him discovering her volume 2 at the end of the first movie, ok, we get her taste in music evolving a bit, stepping firmly from the late 70‚Äôs ballads to mid 80‚Äôs stuff when Quill was born.  This just felt less organic with the transition, and I think there were better choices from the late 80‚Äôs and early 90‚Äôs, we kind of just skipped through the whole decade for no reason.  

I know it‚Äôs weird to keep harping on the music but I feel it‚Äôs so central to the movies it‚Äôs worth discussing.  There were way too many scenes where loud music just booms over a quiet scene with little to no other noise.  It was cool in the first movie, the second did it more without it getting to old, but it felt like they did it 9-10 times in this movie compared to once or twice in the other movies.  I was rolling my eyes by the 5th or 6th time. And it kept happening. 

Last of all it just felt like they put in cute animals and tortured them specifically to tug at our heart strings.  Having a ‚Äúpulled down from heaven‚Äù moment as Rocket is getting revived felt so corny and out of place for the MCU, let alone the guardians movies.  

One bright spot was Zoe Saldana‚Äôs acting, she showed more range in this movie than I realized she had.  Her character was a bit uneven (seemed like her turn from being a dick to softening up a bit came out of nowhere), but I put that on writing more than performance.",2023-08-03

"For all intents and purposes, Adam is a child who is experiencing things for the first time like physical pain. Kids process complex emotions like grief differently. Adam seems to have more of a stoic response and that‚Äôs okay. 

As for badass moments, the danger is if you make Adam too OP, he will steal the show from the Guardians. It would be like when the Justice League are getting their asses handed to them and Superman swoops in at the last minute and wrecks shop. 

Now you might ask: Why introduce Adam if you are just going to nerf him? Well that‚Äôs the ongoing question that seems to plague Marvel going back to the early days of Hulk. I don‚Äôt mind the nerfing if it fits well in the story and this seemed to fit in my opinion.",2023-05-08
Yeah I was hoping for that too. He understood who killed his mother.,2023-05-08

"Yeah that is one of the negative comments people make that I agree with.  Not much focus was put on the enormity of it.   It *was* acknowledged, but ""you killed all those people"" kind of understates it.Did any of batch 90 survive?  They rescued batch 91, which I think was the green people.  It's not really clear just how big the colony was.  We know at least the ""bat"" family had kids.  We saw the first generation likely was created as adults.  I don't remember how old the kids look, so the society is at least as old as those kids I would guess.  Also I don't think it was nicer than our Earth.  That was the point: it ended up as just an anthropomorphic animal version of earth.  The High Evolutionary wanted all of the art and society without the problems.",2023-05-11

Giving Gamora a happy ending of sorts, and having Peter accept her as a new person and accepting that his Gamora is dead, was a better end for me than any of the other options.",2023-05-09
"I actually really identified with the emotional core of the situation. I had a girl I was head over heels in love with, and then we drifted apart and she reinvented herself in a way that to me feels like this. She still exists, but it's not her anymore.

So there's that.",2023-05-11
"I agree killing off Gammorah was dumb (not that it happened at all, but how rushed and glossed over it was in an overpacked film). But she did ask Peter to kill her if Thanos took her, so technically it's what she wanted.

Personally I would have hated them getting back together in 3. That's so cliche, and she's basically a different person who will experience different things... she has zero memories of Quill. I think him coming on way too strong and her rebelling against that fits her character very well. And it was great character growth for Quill to accept that ""his"" Gammorrah is gone and finally start moving on from that.",2023-05-10
"I think that's kind of the point though?  Both Peter and the audience need to understand that the Gamora he loved died.  She was murdered by her ""adoptive"" father.  She can't come back.  And without the several months of events together ""prime"" Gamora had, she never formed the same connections to the others or to Peter.  You can see over the course of the movie her reactions to the team and how much they love each other.  Then at the end she loves her Ravager ""family.""  I think by the end of the movie she understands how ""prime"" Gamora was part of the team and loved Peter, but she's a different person.",2023-05-11

Counter-Earth was not perfect so he blowed it up. Again he explains it to Quill when Quill point out the flaws in Counter-Earth.

"The original Gamora went through a chain of events that made her left Thanos and led to the event at the first movie, then found love and family with the Guardians.

The current Gamora didn't live those moment. She was still a loyal, ruthless daughter of Thanos. Nebula always mentioned about how cruel Gamora was and this new Gamora showed it. 

To her defense, imagine coming to a new universe where everyone loved an alternate version of yourself and tried to convert you to become someone who you are not. That's why she didn't go along with Guardians. Ravagers, however, accepted her as who she is. She found family in them.",2023-05-19

"I get that read, but I didn't take that last interaction as suggesting she's into him or that there's real potential for something between them. It was more going from being pretty annoyed by him to realizing he's a decent dude, kind of a ""Okay, NOW i sort of get how this happened"". It's not her giving the green light. It's her saying she now understands why that other girl gave him the green light.

For example, in real life if your ex's twin sister is adjacent to your friend group, as a result spends more time around you and eventually concedes ""Okay i get how you and sis worked now"", she's not saying SHE wants to date you.",2023-05-08

I got divorced last year and losing her is the hardest thing I've ever gone through. It wasn't a negative or hateful split, we just weren't compatible anymore as spouses, but she's still my best friend and I'd do anything for her. The kind of relationship that played out in the movie; obsessed with the old relationship, being around the woman you love move than anything in the world but knowing that what you had before is gone, and it's not coming back. Coming to peace with the way things are now while not letting go of how you feel inside. Especially the lines, ""You know I'm still not who you want me to be."" ""I know, but who you are ain't so bad."" It's just perfectly written and encapsulates that feeling of bittersweet acceptance of not having what you want, but appreciating what you still have.

"Hardest a movie has made me cry since Grave of the Fireflies. No, I'm not joking.

"I'm honestly afraid to watch it after reading about these scenes. Which sucks, because I really do want to see the rest of it, but I'm like your wife, this kind of shit gets to me and will stick with me for ages (I can still tear up on cue just by thinking about that goddamn Futurama episode).

"I usually just cry on sad/touching scenes on TV shows and movies. But for some reason, I did not shed a single tear on this. Probably because I expected them to die. I am pretty sure most people predicted that. But some part of me still hope I was wrong. When they died, I just feel sad, sad that they never got a chance to at least see the sky before they die. My thoughts then was really on how Rocket must have felt, that there was nothing he can do at that time to change the outcome.

But I don't think I can watch the movie again. I watched the movie really late at night, so I was probably a little sleepy to really process the movie. I will probably cry manly tears if I watch the movie again.",2023-05-05
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been thinking about it all day. Phenomenal movie but I plan on never watching it again lmao,2023-05-06

Agreed. I can‚Äôt watch this again. I‚Äôm going to start bawling because of that one scene. It was lowkey traumatizing,2023-05-07
I said this too. Incredibly good movie but I will not be able to watch this ever again. Also I don't think anyone under the age of 18 should watch it. I'm 27 and I could not handle what I watched,2023-05-05

"Yea this is it. Both Ragnarok and Love and Thunder had similar scenes designed to catch up casual viewers on the story, disguised as a gag.",2023-05-13
"Quill explains what happened with him and Gamora to the manager in the elevator, including a line where he mentions he lost his temper and almost killed half the universe by punching Thanos - Gunn has said he disagreed with that creative decision.",2023-05-05
"Tl;dw is that Gamora and Nebula are the adopted daughters of a guy named Thanos who's obsessed with killing half the universe to ensure long term stability against resource depletion (yes it's kinda dumb, obviously the population will replenish with time). Thanos plots to get a bunch of powerful artifacts called the Infinity Stones to enact this plan (once he has them all he has to do is snap his fingers to get what he wants), but to get one of them he needs to sacrifice someone he truly loves - Gamora - so he kills her by throwing her into a bottomless pit. That Gamora is still dead.

Eventually he succeeds in killing half the universe with The Snap because Peter fucks up and punches him in the face in revenge for Gamora when they've temporarily successfully subdued him. After the Snap, Thanos is tracked down and Thor slices his fucking head off, but ultimately it doesn't matter because he already won.

Everyone is sad for 5 years because he also destroyed the infinity stones to prevent anyone from reversing The Snap, but then they do time travel to get a new set of infinity stones to reverse the snap. In the process, they bring Thanos and Gamora back via time travel as well, and this Gamora is still working for Thanos because it's before she ditched his ass, and Past Thanos damn near re-acquires the stones. Tony Stark manages to trick Thanos and gets ahold of the stones and undoes the Snap, killing both himself (a human overwhelmed by cosmic power) and Thanos (probably intentionally killed by Tony) in the process (some real Jesus imagery in all of that too).",2023-05-19
"Damn this just made me realize, Rockets friends must have been ""successes"" too

They may not have been as smart as Rocket, but they were able to give themselves names. I guess the high evolutionary overlooked them because they couldn't do the crazy science shit that Rocket could",2023-05-06
Especially with how much Bautista has been saying he'll never play Drax again.,2023-05-05

"I really thought that was gonna be it in the weird as fuck bio engineered angel of the Bible. It now makes me wonder if that existed and that‚Äôs how the Bible got those descriptions of angels?

But then I realized it was Rockets story, so I put money on him next. Loved where Gunn went with it.",2023-05-07
I was sure going in Rocket would die.,2023-05-10
It‚Äôs much more satisfying to see all the Guardians choosing their own destinies rather than one of them dying and they decide to disband.,2023-05-05
He‚Äôs slowly becomes a bigger and bigger deal in the comics and he has been leader of the guardians a couple of times in the comic. He and groom play a huge role in secret wars so I‚Äôm looking forward to see what they do with him in that. Plus rocket is basically mcu‚Äôs grogu so they can‚Äôt kill him off. He sells too much merch.,2023-05-05
"I was sure Rocket and Drax would die. All the trailers set up Rocket. Bautistas contract was up and he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs done with Marvel. I also expected Quill would die. Nebula was pretty much the only one I thought was safe but by the end, they had done so much character growth for her that I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised. Kraglin I wasn‚Äôt sure about. He‚Äôs James Gunn‚Äôs brother but then again, he‚Äôs James Gunn‚Äôs brother",2023-05-05
yeah i kept thinking 'damn this is how he dies?',2023-05-06
"The whole plot was ""saving Rocket"", so I feel that he was the only one who was safe, as them failing to acomplish their initial mission would frustrate the viewers.",2023-05-08
"Well, technically I think he did die.",2023-05-06
I was almost sure Drax was going to die cause of some leaks. Am really happy the leaks I saw weren't legit,2023-05-10
During his moment with Lylla I legit thought they would go what way and the rest of the movie would be about Guardians revenge,2023-05-15
Yeah I totally thought he was going to die about midway through and the movie turn into a revenge flick.,2023-05-07
"Yeah, I like how they handled it too. He was about to join Lyla, Teef and Floor but they knew he had a higher calling and more people who depended on Rocket to live.

It puts him in such a different light now. Before he was just the comic relief. But now he literally has a higher calling to save species who need protecting.",2023-05-20

"Man, Microsoft should‚Äôve totally revived a special edition of the Zune on this movie",2023-05-06
"Same, I was confident Rocket wasn't going to die, it seemed like a clear mislead. Drax however was my favorite for likely to die since he's expressed he's done and I believe him.",2023-05-05
"I think some of the more interesting points were not focused on enough in lieu of action scenes. I get this franchise has always been more about humor, but would have been nice to get some more serious moments, besides just the backstory for Rocket. So many people dying, Warlock's mom's death, Gamora and the void it left the whole team, Quill and Nebula, etc.

Thought it was very funny that they were all dancing at the end rejoicing, when so many casualties happened moments before.

I think MCU doesn't give enough weight to female characters' conclusion arcs, like Gamora and Black Widow when they died.",2023-05-24
Love & Thunder's biggest crime is not letting Gorr do more butchering.,2023-05-07

"I did too, but only because no one else had died up to that point when all I heard was it was going to be chalk full of death.",2023-05-06
"> There were a handful of times where at any given moment I felt a core member was in trouble and nope! they all made it out okay! 

I found with all the fake out deaths,  had they gone through with it or would have really made an objectively worse movie to the point I was more relieved they didn't make that choice than I was the character was alive. 

Like imagine if groot had died at the start of the movie by Adam decapitating him and that was just it for groot.  Or drax actually got killed by Nathan Fillions little gun after fucking charging down Thanos and stabbing the tentacle thing from inside its stomach.  

Don't get me started on what a terrible fucking story choice or would have been to kill rocket on the operating table after the whole first two acts were about saving him,  intercut with his orgin story,  and we never see him actually confront his literal maker after he's grown over the last decade.   Or if Quill died floating in space because he went back for his zune without even speaking to anyone after the whole movie hinted at going home to find his grandfather.",2023-05-06

He wasn‚Äôt ever away from his friends. He was in a comma for like 2 days. He went out and came back with them all.,2023-05-06
"only ones that left were mantis and peter really, Knowehere I imagine will always be the HQ where Drax and Nebula are. Other than that he still has everyone else on this team (Groot, etc) and some new ones.",2023-05-10
"As long as he's always with Groot I'll be happy, that's a team they can't split up!",2023-05-07
From a collection of broken people in GotG 1 to healed and whole characters. What a trilogy.,2023-05-05
Yea it would have been veryyyy cheesy if they ended up back together again,2023-05-05
100 percent!  That‚Äôs why I loved this trilogy.  Nothin is forced and everything feels logical.  It would‚Äôve sucked to force Quill and Gamora together and typical movie ending but not real life ending,2023-05-06
That was a really good scene! He needed that - he thought he'd figured out life when he fell in love but the truth was he still had a lot of figuring out left,2023-05-07
"Everyone‚Äôs story ended how they wanted, and if Gamora‚Äôs ended with Quill, then was was she really in control of her story? Peter going back to Earth was a better ending given what‚Äôs happened to him.",2023-05-08
"And I love the fact he doesn't challenge her on that, he realizes that she's right and moves forward in stride. It's nice to see the respect for his growth from 2 where he isn't just a man baby but is able to accept that kind of critique and move forward learning from it.",2023-05-18
I thought Zoe Saldana's acting was great in that scene,2023-05-29
This story meaning the third movie,2023-05-10
"Peter at the end of 2 realized he had a family in the ravagers as well, right? Due to Peters emotional state I believe he couldn't really see it and said some hurtful things.",2023-05-06
Yea was a nice touch.,2023-05-05
Yeah one of the ravager pulling her hair is definitely a brother move.,2023-05-10
well one Peters girlfriend was killed.,2023-05-06
And both of them are orphans too.,2023-05-11
"I liked that too and the touch of her being alone in the ship with Rocket makes it clear she actively chose to help in all those situations . No pressure of someone talking up a dead version of you in your ear . Strictly based on what she learned on her own .

Plus the end credit group scene she‚Äôs the only one not in costume as she isn‚Äôt a Guardian .",2023-05-05
Everyone but Black widow‚Ä¶still salty about her and gamora perma-dying,2023-05-11
Isn‚Äôt that the point tho ? Peter didn‚Äôt see their interactions either and assumed from his experience with a different version of her it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù and thought their relationship was more important not realizing it isn‚Äôt even the same person . We and Peter are making an assumption based off feelings of a past and Gone Gamora . She found her family in the ravegers and that‚Äôs who this current one wants to be with,2023-05-07
The writers did it so that Gunn would have a Gamora to use in Vol.3 if he wanted to,2023-05-09
"He did have it in Infinity War, probably a continuity error tho",2023-05-06
Oh. Thanks for clearing that up.,2023-05-05
"I enjoyed it. I really thought they were going to let him die. End of the guardians era.

He never used his helmet or jet pack in any other scene in this movie so I didn't presume he had them.",2023-05-07
"I chuckled hard on that action, it might seem like a throwaway gag as Debicki is very tall but i agree, it also feeds into the character of the HE. That god complex he has, makes his ego so fragile enough to want to up himself over his sub-ordindates.",2023-05-05
"God bless Elizabeth Debecki, we need more tall women",2023-05-05
What happened to the Sovereign at the end anyway? Are they left without any leaders?,2023-05-05
"> Debecki herself is tall at 6'2"" / 190cm

I also noticed that she was also wearing *very* tall heels, had to have added 4"" inches to her height.",2023-05-05
"She also had big-ass heels on in that scene so was probably standing at 6'6"" or something! Would tower nearly everyone else normally so him having that box showed so much of how he views his creations.",2023-05-05
"It's like those RDJ face-to-face shots (with Pepper, Strange, etc...) where he's obviously standing on something.",2023-05-06
"Im 6ft and would love Aeysha to be standing over me. Hell, let her put some heels on.",2023-05-08
"Most movies work around the height of actors/actresses, so I actually liked how in Tenet that Christopher Nolan just let her be tall as hell. 

Kept putting her in heels, and then that chase scene in the SUV.",2023-05-12
why did they make her look unhinged do ya think?,2023-05-06
190cm is 6‚Äò3‚Äò‚Äò,2023-05-06
"It's okay though, he ordered his hot sauce an hour ago",2023-05-06
The Tenet blu ray has a behind the scene pic of Kenneth Branagh threatening Debicki and it's hilarious because of the huge difference in height. The film lessens it with the camera angles but without that it's so stark.,2023-05-15
"Yeah I confused the characters.  Thanks for the correction. Makes sense since she's 6' 3"".  Either way I was dying",2023-05-06
It was when he entered his main corridor in the first act. I believe the scene when he found out that Adam Warlock couldn't catch Rocket.,2023-05-05
He kind of examines her eye and then touches her face and mouth as he's talking to her as a sort of creepy power/dominance move.,2023-05-21
I thought it was a gag... looks like I'll have to go see it again to make sure. Oh well.,2023-05-07
Yes to this. I need an Animal Cruelty-Free Cut.,2023-05-08
Which part did it for you in Logan?,2023-07-30

Animals aren‚Äôt bred in slaughterhouses‚Ä¶,2023-06-12
"This is exactly how I feel. Like the movie was well made and all, but it went way, way too far for me. I'm very sensitive to extremely dark, depressing, disturbing shit and this movie really piled it on. It was a good movie but I don't think I liked it. I think some of that stuff is going to be lingering in my mind for a while, ""triggered"" is the perfect word for it.",2023-05-10
Don't watch Bambi then üòëüòëüòëüòë Some kids movies are really sad,2023-08-07
"I saw it with a pal that's pretty quick most of the time.  After the first post credits scene, I said, ""so it wasn't a trap after all.  It was a face off.""

He looked at me and shrugged with his face.  ""What?""

""The line, it gets repeated, it's not a trap, it's a face off.  It was a face off.""

He furrowed his brow at me, still not getting it.  

""They took his fucking face off, Kyle.""

""Ooooooooooooh""",2023-05-05
I mean he had a playlist of 2000s music so he might‚Äôve known the movie,2023-05-07
He was on Earth for Endgame. Someone definitely loaded him up on Nic Cage movies before he left.,2023-05-05
Because it wasn't a reference. Quill left earth over a decade before Face/Off was a thing. He's being literal about it being a face off like in 80s movies. The fact that they literally peel the HE's mask off is just a perk.,2023-05-05
"I'm sad this joke got lost in the italian version. Adaptations in the italian are usually great, but I guess this one was too difficult to port.

(In italian, the recurring quote by Star Lord is something along the line of ""It's not a trap, it's a confrontation"")",2023-05-06
"They don't make any of it a reference to the movie, though it's easy to think of it. But at no point does Peter refer to the film, he just refers to a face-off as a generic concept.",2023-05-06
Was James Gunn involved with Face/off?,2023-05-09
How could you know this?,2023-05-05
Also \*that\* face-off in 2013.,2023-07-14
Yeah there was a lot more moments to breathe like even the moment where Quill was trying to have a private conversation with Gamora even though had a joke scene shortly after still had longer to breathe than when we saw in GotG 2 when all of the other loyal Ravagers were killed off and then we got the Taserface joke.,2023-05-05
"Noticed that too! Was actually anxious a few times because I thought a great scene was about to get the ‚ÄúMantis, look out!‚Äù treatment from Vol. 2. Pleasantly surprised I don‚Äôt recall it happening in this one.",2023-05-05
"Gunn might need some help from a big reputable law firm, maybe HHM?",2023-07-13
It's way better that they didn't. Show don't tell is a mark of a great movie.,2023-05-05
"Didn't Drax yell something like ""his face came off!""?",2023-05-06
Now that would have been a 10/10 post credits scene over eating cereal,2023-05-11

Right after murdering an entire hallway of people üòÇ,2023-05-13
"I feel like this quote should be comedically inserted somewhere like:

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt kill you‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt have to save you from that fatal stab wound I just inflicted you with.‚Äù",2023-05-05
IM BATMAN. I mean Rocket Racoon.,2023-05-06
"Meanwhile, in another universe: ""I won't kill you but I will turn you into a fucking vegetable"" - Vengeance",2023-05-20
Yeah def felt like the trope of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll murder all the henchmen but I can‚Äôt stoop to the bad guys level and kill *him* so I‚Äôll let him live‚Äù. Loved the movie but that‚Äôs one thing I don‚Äôt think was executed perfectly,2023-05-05
"It felt especially weird to me because the goons they kill in the hallway were all (or many were at least) twisted creations of the High Evolutionary, just like Rocket is? Like, they had no say over their creation either. They *were* obstacles and I could‚Äôve certainly overlooked it, if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that Rocket ‚Äòspared‚Äô the head honcho.

Loved the movie to bits, every step of the way, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But yeah, that stood out in my mind for sure.",2023-05-05
Those people were attacking them. It‚Äôs not like they were shooting people in the head that were no longer a threat.,2023-05-05
"Slight difference between killing someone who is actively trying to murder you, and executing someone you have managed to take down and is now defenseless.

Still weird they just left him.",2023-05-05
"It's a pretty common problem in action movies tbh. Goons and the like are ok to kill, but the main villain who's causing the most harm? Nah, they can't stoop to their level.",2023-05-05
"Yes, but they were all bad.",2023-05-05
"This bothered me too but the more I think about it, I like it. He was killing goons to get through the his objective of saving the kids and animals, but having found a family let him let go of the rage that would have driven him to revenge. 

The high evolutionary was a bad guy, but he was hardly a threat. He wasn‚Äôt trying to conquer anything, he was just an awful person with his own little fiefdom that he fucked with as he wanted. Once rocket got the kids out, he was done with him.

He wasn‚Äôt saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like you‚Äù like this trope often does, he was saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need this anymore.‚Äù",2023-05-05
Drax was a complete dick to the civilized animal people for no reason too lol. Probably killed the guy who‚Äôs motorcycle he stole.,2023-05-05
"I think the difference is that High Evo was no longer a threat, whereas most of all the henchmen were actively fighting them. And they did spare some henchmen that they convinced not to fight.",2023-05-07
"HE was defeated, and no longer a threat to them. I'm pretty sure we can classify every other kill as hostile combatants",2023-05-09
And Gamora stabbed Evo in the gut just seconds before. Pretty sure he was finished by that.,2023-05-11
They actually were stunning a lot of the humans. Now the hell spawns were murdered.,2023-05-18
Shit that would have been great. It could have played out in a variety of ways.,2023-05-07

Hey we didn‚Äôt see him die. He could have gone in the machine to survive.,2023-05-18
If he did that and then dropped that line again with a shrug or something it would have been both in character and in tone for the movie and a satisfying end,2023-05-06
"the dude blew up a planet mirroring earth with billions of sentient life forms... I don't think a bit of defeat and humiliation is enough of a punishment, and certainly isn't going to put an end to his schemes.",2023-05-09
"Rocket did something to bypass his tech, which is why he was able to get a cheap shot in. From there the rest of the team just caught him off guard I believe. Rocket may have even found a way to disable his suit completely, I don't quite remember.",2023-05-05
"We really didn‚Äôt need another five minute action sequence there. It would‚Äôve ruined the third-act pacing and damaged the emotional weight of Rocket‚Äôs victory.

Plus the Guardians are actually really powerful when they work together like they did against the HE. And the HE was never that strong; he mainly just had his gravity powers. As soon as he got caught off guard, he‚Äôs just a dude. He‚Äôs way, way weaker than Thanos or Kang.",2023-05-06
"""When criminals fight me, it's exhausting because I'm so good. So they often have to nap afterwards...""",2023-05-05

Agreed.. Brilliant in Bandersnatch as well,2023-05-05
"My first real exposure to him was the movie Detroit. And he was pretty fantastic in it. And since he was fantastic in it, I have an instinctual revulsion to him that I'm slowly rehabbing.",2023-05-05
He was great in dopesick,2023-05-05
"I kept thinking about how James Gunn said he refuses to work with any actors who aren't cool and calm on the set and how that kid is probably super chill 

Like Gunn just won't take any ego drama on his sets",2023-05-10
"Maybe but as a kid he was already a gem- Son of Rambow and that sketch show School of Comedy, he was brilliant. He was even quite good in that Narnia movies",2023-05-06

"He never was a bad actor, a lot of people only know him from that Adam Sandler comedy but Poulter has a long acting career since he was a kid. That doesnt just happen.",2023-05-17
Hes grown in to his eyebrows that's for sure,2023-05-14
He was always good. Anyone who could convincingly do the Eustace Scrubb redemption arc at that age had potential.,2023-08-03
I completely agree and i think some people are getting angry thinking gunn fucked warlocks character when in actuality he did the right thing nerfing him and portraying him as a inexperienced and immature cosmic being. He literally could of just carried the whole movie had he been at full power.,2023-05-07
He's just a baby ü§£ü§£.. I'm sure in future he will realize his full potential,2023-05-05
Pretty much all of his lines had me laughing. Poulter‚Äôs line delivery was superb. Huge fan of him as an actor.,2023-05-07
The opening made me very excited for Gunn's Superman film.  He clearly knows how to handle a god tier character which isn't something most people can do.  He nailed that fight.  Adam was flying around putting the hurt on everyone and not a single second felt wrong or skewed in the Guardians favor.,2023-05-08
"I was gonna say, he felt shoehorned but they dealt with it as they could since the cocoon was set up in Vol 2 but having him be released early, with more room to grow, was smart. He could have been a major character for the Infinity Gauntlet adaptation but I hope to see more of him through these next few phases. His voice felt like Adam",2023-08-12
"Haha yes! That line was my favorite of the whole thing. Either that or Rocket's delivery of ""I'm not a raccoon"" as he's leaving purgatory after his and Lyla's heartfelt conversation. Both were so perfectly placed.",2023-05-06
"Probably the only moment in the entire movie that got a genuine, hearty laugh out of me. It was so natural and bizarre at the same time to hear that given the context.",2023-05-06

"And when she said yes he fucking died. Like he was cool dying if that meant being with them again.

"And the way she replied, she just said ""yes"" but the line delivery was so good, there was an ""of course you can come, where else would you go"" in that one fucking syllable.  Great job from Hawkeye's wife on that one.",2023-05-05
The thought that he maybe thought they wouldn't welcome him because he was guilty over their deaths is CRUSHING.,2023-05-05

And then everything gets wrecked by adding in a dumb CGI dragon monster that kills the father. Like bruh. Made Shang Chi getting the rings feel a lot less powerful, if he had converted all 10 rings on his own rather than been given them because his dad died it would have been thematically so much better. 

Honestly, fuck that dragon. Made an otherwise fantastic movie kinda mediocre at the end.",2023-05-07

"Oh damn, here I was thinking that he had learned to speak another language that we could understand. I may have thought that because the entire movie I was wondering if Groot's species could even learn other speech.

"glad I just watched the first trailer once or twice, drax line ""We kill one loser that nobody loves"" still got me hard in the theatre",2023-05-05
I wish I didn't watch the one with the suits and colored buttons. It was funnier in theaters than when I first watched it in the clip. Presumably because I was in the movies flow. So I wish it was the first time I saw it.,2023-05-05
Unfortunately there were several funny jokes that got spoiled by the trailers.,2023-05-05
They showed that to us in the theatre before the movie!? Like why?? We are already here to see the movie we don‚Äôt need anymore teasers to convince us,2023-05-05
I think the worst part of that is including the scene in the trailers made it so it was clear he wasn't dying when Nathan Fillion shot him.   I remember almost immediately that this scene in the trailer hadn't happened yet.,2023-05-05
This is exactly why I don‚Äôt watch trailers more than once.,2023-05-06

Same with the hallway fight scene too. So many directors don‚Äôt realize the best way to shoot a team fight scene is to make it easy for the audience to follow where they are in relation to each other and Gunn does that wonderfully there,2023-05-05
"When I saw Nebula putting up their sign I thought, ""what a nice moment, I bet that sign is gonna get destroyed soon"" lol.",2023-05-05
Yeah it did a good job of showing what the Guardians had done for those audience members that maybe hadn‚Äôt seen the Holiday Special,2023-05-05
"The best part of that long shot was that it was paced at Rocket's pace -- he walks slow and so it matched him and took longer than an average human would.

It was paced for Rocket so we would know it was his film and his story.",2023-05-06
It was such a good encapsulation of teamwork in cinematic combat. The final fight in the recent D&D movie is another strong example.,2023-05-05

"Not to mention the action sequence with Warlock afterwards really set the tone. I was aware of Gunn‚Äôs statement about how this will be the last film with this team together, but I wasn‚Äôt really sure what that would mean for the fate of each of the Guardians. Seeing them get the shit beat out of them by Warlock really got me nervous for the ending.",2023-05-05

I‚Äôm just bummed out because I imagine he‚Äôd still be making stuff for Marvel if they hadn‚Äôt pushed him to DC by caving to right wing shitheads.  I guess the plus side is that DC has a shot at improving now.,2023-05-05

"Yeah, and they even pointed out how she recognized the beauty in their relationship but they still went on their own way because she‚Äôs different person.

Like a genuinely good breakup, you can recognize the good times but agree that it‚Äôs best to keep moving forward.",2023-05-07
It is the right ending but so many writers chicken out. There are nuances to writing choices that AI can't replicate imo,2023-05-05
I'm also glad they didn't force Quill and Nebula either.,2023-05-06
"The whole movie was about them all finding their own way, they'd been the guardians so long they all just played their portion of the part, they all needed to have their own separate next chapter. 

Also holy shit guys I think I finally understand Groot!!!",2023-05-06
I agree plus when MJ and Peter get back together it won‚Äôt feel as formulaic since Gamora and Peter had essentially the same problem,2023-05-05
"Late to the discussion, but for the 4 years since Endgame, I knew James gunn could only do justice to the characters by flipping the expectation of them reuniting on its head. Gamora's screed against Peter in the middle of the movie was perfect. They went all the way with reinforcing Gamora is her own person without going too heavy handed by saying something like ""I'm not a prize"".",2023-05-17
Don‚Äôt get me started..,2023-05-05
"> Forcing them back together would‚Äôve felt like a cop out in a way.

I disagree. Having them fall in love with each other again feels like what the movie was building towards. Having Gamora end up with Sly Stallone and the Ravagers in the end felt like the cop out.",2023-05-05
"I 100% agree. I think she and Quill developed to a place where they appreciated each other, but I never felt as though she loved Quill romantically the way that he felt about her. This is definitely the right ending for the both of them.",2023-05-05
"And disrespectful to the original love story. Yes they‚Äôre technically the same person but not in so many ways that really count.

Quills Gamora was murdered/died, this is a different Gamora. Thats a better, more heartbreaking story imo.

I just wish Original Gamoras send off in infinity war hadn‚Äôt been quite so rushed.",2023-05-06
I didn‚Äôt get that at all. I feel like that same exact growth arc happened here. Obviously not as strong as the connection built in the first movie but it really couldn‚Äôt ever be the same for multiple reasons. I think Gamora‚Äôs comment at the end was her kind of saying that she gets what ‚Äúshe‚Äù and Peter and had together.,2023-05-05
"Hell they weren't even a ""thing"" in the 2nd movie either. It was more secretive but they weren't ready to show it yet.",2023-05-05
honestly I felt that in the first movie she actually warmed up to him pretty fast. all it really takes it for him to share some music.,2023-05-06
"I think the movie likes to play around with the idea that Drax is an idiot but actually the smartest in the room about certain things. 

When he talks about Gamora being dead I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs doing it out of anger to comfort Quill in a ‚Äòshe‚Äôs dead to us‚Äô manner. I think he‚Äôs pointing out that yes, their Gamora is dead. This one is from an alternative universe and Quill and the others were kind of unwilling to fully accept that. I think it was the movie‚Äôs way of warning us that things wouldn‚Äôt go back to normal because ultimately these are entirely different people now and we can‚Äôt pretend Gamora isn‚Äôt still really dead.",2023-05-05

"They did almost all get their looks like it's their death scene. 

Drax with getting hit twice by Nathan Fillion that looked like it had landed possibly fatal blows. 

Rocket and his death but not. 

Peter and his what looked like a space death. 

Nebula sort of in the beginning until she rebuilt herself. 

Groot with his head being torn off. 

Glad they all made it",2023-05-05

"When I saw the golden hand of Warlock, I first thought it was the green hand or Gamora, as a callback to that scene from the first movie. Am I colorblind?",2023-05-05
That was one of the main things that irked me too. I know in the beginning he was a drunk and blah blah blah but he didn't have his helmet at all during this movie? Weird choice.,2023-05-05
I hated itüòÇ like watching an ex be happy with someone else but the ex didn‚Äôt leave you she died so you don‚Äôt even have the real rejection to fuel you to move on. That scene was tough for me liking Gamora and Quill arc from Vol1 and 2,2023-05-19
"This 100%. I think this movie is the best his character has been. I have felt like he‚Äôs been this kind of generic, lovestruck guy for a while now and he became one of my least favorite MCU characters. Pratt‚Äôs performance in this movie really flipped me around. Now that he‚Äôs moved on, I do not mind the idea of continuing on with the character without the other Guardians around. Also really excited at the idea of the new team, with Rocket leading them.",2023-05-05
100% it's Chris Pratt.,2023-05-05
I wish they wouldn‚Äôt have this was actually worse like bring her back but don‚Äôt actually. Everyone says no one died in this film but to me old Gamora really died here in them not bringing her memories back.,2023-05-19

"Rocket became a true superhero with a shirtless scene, a fridged love interest, and not killing the villain as a moral stance after killing a ton of his minions",2023-05-05
"I think the point was they they don't kill the helpless. 

Everyone they killed was also trying to kill them and they fought back in kind. For example, when they are attacked by those worm creatures Mantis realises that they don't mean harm but are just scared and she calms them down.

So they free the innocent kids and then go back to save Rocket from the High Evolutionary. They tell Rocket that he can kill the guy who caused him so much pain and murdered his true friends but he decides his time would be better spent freeing the animals. 

As he says, ""I'm a Guardian of the Galaxy"", meaning he's a protector, not an assassin. Then in the post-credits sequence the kid asks Rocket if he feels bad about killing the animals that are attacking and he basically says, ""No, because we're fighting for people who can't fight back"". 

It's full circle with him learning to finally realise what being a GOTG means. As General Mattis once said: ""I come in peace. I don't want to hurt you and I didn‚Äôt bring artillery. But I‚Äôm pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I‚Äôll kill you all.""",2023-05-05

"I found all of that to be a going too far. Like, I understood rocket had a tragic past but to beat I the audience over the head with animal cruelty like that is just manipulative filmmaking. Sure all filmmaking is emotional manipulation on some level but I found myself resenting this particular brand of it. My favorite thing about the Guardians movies is how they tightrope walk a very specific tone between silly and solemn but there were so many parts of this one that felt more mean spirited than the others and it put me off even though I was so ready to love it. There were sections I enjoyed so maybe it will grow on me with a second viewing but my initial feeling is that it was kind of miserable and thats without even delivering on the marketing‚Äôs heavy suggestion that the Guardians were going to all die on this adventure.

I was telling my gf she should either wait to see it at home when we can fast forward or skip it because she doesn‚Äôt do well with animals in peril. Surprised,she asked if it was really that cruel. It made me question if I was crazy or had I really gone to see a Guardians movie featuring an amputated bunny with mechanical spider legs and a robot muzzle begging for rocket and a wheelchair walrus with rusty metal eyelids to run away before they were gunned down. Like what business does this movie have being that dour?",2023-05-05

Since his introduction I've been critical of his portrayal, the leaning into comic relief. 

When Drax says: ""You really think I'm stupid?"" I felt he was talking to fans like me. 

Mantis giving him a reset and later telling him he was to be a father, not a Destroyer, is a great little arc for Drax.

"Oh, yeah, I get that its not the last time we'll see him (or anyone of the other Guardians, for that matter). 

Its just for a character of Adam Warlock's stature in the comics, I would think he deserves his own movie. 

I heard rumours that he was initially supposed to serve the role that Captain Marvel did in Endgame, along with getting his own movie (hence the teaser at the ends of GOTG2), which would have made more sense to me given his ties to the soul stone in the comics.

"Agreed. With Gunn leaving, Boseman passing away, and Johnathan Majors'  issues and possible recasting of this phase's big bad, the new phase has slim-to-no chance at matching the Infinity era. 

But instead of playing into that, and making more stand alone movies and shows like Moon Knight that arent just tie ins to an ensemble movie, they're going to try and force the magic of the first ten years.... but, hell, if a movie about stealing cars can turn into a $6,000,0000,000 franchise, then there's always hope for at least some fun popcorn flicks.

The real test is going to be if they can avoid fucking up the Fantastic Four for the fourth time.",2023-05-06

Purple is also one of the rarest colors in nature, at the edge of our visible light spectrum, so it seems dark and exotic to us the way outer space would. Throw in the royalty connotations (because of its natural rarity), and you've got an easy choice for the color scheme of a space tyrant.",2023-05-05

Widow was a super assassin for years pre SHIELD. Valkyrie literally captured people for the Grandmaster to use as slaves or fodder in death matches. But we never really see that.

Then there's Wanda who has been corrupted by the Darkhold in Multiverse of Madness where we see her killing fodder sorcerers left and right and then ripping through a team of AU heroes on screen. Because we experience that, it sticks with the audience rather than it just being something that was mentioned. Similarly Wandavision a year earlier had her possess a small town with them suffering the effects of her possession.",2023-05-05

He was humble and even bordering on kind at times, genuinely believing he was doing the right thing and even felt pain and sadness through his journey. And at the end of his journey, he didn't gloat, celebrate, or cheer. He simply sat down and enjoyed the sunset, believing he saved the universe. It humanizes him and makes him a more sympathetic villain. 

The High Evolutionary was just a remorseless, obnoxious perfectionist with an ego so massive it makes Tony Stark look like Ghandi by comparison. The actor absolutely nailed it in making us hate the character.",2023-05-05

This is exactly what I was thinking! Also what about the whole part when they‚Äôre mowing down the sheep and the girl asks ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you feel bad?‚Äù And Rocket is like nooo it‚Äôs fine cause we‚Äôre protecting people. It felt like the movie was saying that animal testing is bad but animal exploitation like eating the frogs and killing animals that cause us issues is okay. What a confusing message.,2023-05-24
Considering the downvotes guess the animal abuse stuff went over people‚Äôs heads. It‚Äôs okay to lock animals in dark cages and kill them horrifically if it means we get a burger in the end! But if it‚Äôs done to create some higher life form in a movie then it‚Äôs not okay and we should be sad,2023-05-24
That was one of my favorite movements of the movie. For your exact reasoning.,2023-05-06

Yes I think that‚Äôs exactly what Gunn intended.,2023-05-11
"It's also the positioning of the characters to be fair. There was absolutely no reason for MODOK to want to redeem himself. He ***hated*** Scott and Hank. I can see him turning on Kang after being mistreated by them, but out of revenge rather than some sort of selfless sacrifice. Whereas Adam Warlock is almost literally a new born taking in the universe for the first time, and after being with High Evolutionary and Ayesha this is undoubtedly the first time he's witnessed that kind of selfless compassion that Groot has.",2023-05-05
In Guardians 3 it also ties into the theme of recognizing individuals' worth in contrast to the High Evolutionary,2023-05-10
the cringy dick line isn‚Äôt from Gunn‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,2023-05-06
"I have a hard time thinking that the High Evolutionary‚Äôs motivations were not, at least a little, Gunn critiquing cancel culture. Him saying he wants a world without bigotry and injustice but being willing to destroy all of the ‚Äúflawed‚Äù creatures over and over to make that happen is very on-the-nose.",2023-05-09

We're told about his cruelty - especially towards Nebula - but it's only put on screen one time - again, when he's torturing Nebula.  He is shown to have a certain degree for the concepts of life and happiness, even if he's willing to sacrifice trillions of individuals for the betterment of their future descendants.

The High Evolutionary, however, is shown to be absolutely malicious toward his own creations.  Despite his knowledge of art and science, there is no grace or dignity to his great works.  He  Furthermore, he's shown to be incompetent.  Even his greatest successes - the manufacture of entire species and civilizations - are shown to be hopelessly flawed, so much that he chooses to obliterate them rather than let them grow.",2023-05-06

I‚Äôm so glad they got their heads out of their asses and brought him back to finish the Guardians trilogy because yeah, like you said this is really the first (and only) amazing MCU trilogy. I think a lot of that too is because of how self contained Gunn kept them from the greater MCU. Like sure yeah they mention the infinity stones in this but it‚Äôs not like you had cameos from Captain Marvel or something like that.",2023-05-05

 I'm glad my son didn't ask to go, he would not have handled it well.",2023-05-05
"It is *VERY* violent at times, and there's quite a bit of death for a Marvel movie; it's definitely the least child-friendly of the trilogy. 9 might be a bit young for this; it really uses the PG-13 rating to the fullest, including Marvel's first actual F-bomb if that matters to you.",2023-05-05
"It's probably the most viscerally brutal film in the MCU.  There are some hard beatings in this movie with a good bit of blood, and some of that comes right out of the gate. 

There is a LOT of animal cruelty, explicit and implied.  There's a character that (to me, at least) was such a Frankenstein mash of things that it upset me.  That character has a panic attack while under duress.  It's not a fun moment. 

There's a moment toward the very end of the film that is maybe the most graphically distressing shot in the entire MCU.  

There are a few moments where main characters are in serious jeopardy. 

Having said all that, I'm a horror movie guy and there was nothing that was too much for me.  I watch movies with my nephew that *might* be too much for him.

He could watch this one in his sleep.
I am also the guy that routinely thanks his Dad for taking him to see Raiders of the Lost Ark at the ripe old age of five, and that movie ends with two people's heads melting away and another guys head exploding, so...

Depends on the 9 year old.  If she's used to violence, if she's watched enough of it, then yeah, take her.  If she is a softie for animals, then for the love of all that is holy, maybe don't.  But maybe do, because the best thing about Gotg3 is how it pays off all the story beats and achieves catharsis by doing so.",2023-05-05

"Been pondering this with all the comments regarding it (the PG-13 rating and how this movie pushing the limits of it), and I think it‚Äôs actually the reverse of what everyone has come to expect from this rating.  

I reckon in recent years PG-13 movies have been diluted in terms of violence and suggestive material, obv in order to allow younger kids to come see movies that would otherwise be meant for teens and up.  

This is the precise reason that this rating was invented in the first place.  Pretty sure Temple of Doom was rated PG and a dude gets his heart ripped out like goddamn Mortal Kombat.  So they invented PG-13, with a very specific number, to say hey these movies aren‚Äôt for young kids.

So yeah, any kid under 13 might very well be scared or even traumatized by the imagery in this movie.  Because technically they shouldn‚Äôt be there.",2023-05-05
I straight up think it was inappropriate to make happy meals of this movie it was so disturbing and violent. Great film,2023-05-09
"That film should not have been PG-13, the face scene alone should have made it R (arguably all the animal torture too).",2023-05-10

"Hemsworth is really good at playing a himbo idiot and I have no problem letting them lean into the actor's talent. That movie just got too overstuffed. There were like 5 or 6 plots going on all at once and it was just too much to carry. They could have made a movie about Valkyrie trying to rule New Asgard, or a movie about Jane becoming Thor, or a movie about Thor fighting the God Butcher but it was too much to smash them all together",2023-05-05
Difference is Taika really didn't actually give a shit about the story or characters of L&T or take them very seriously. By a lot of accounts his priority was a lot partying with the film being like a fun goofy diversion he gets to inject a bunch of his jokes into all willy nilly to let the editor pick the ones that work.,2023-05-05

"I'm probably the biggest Multiverse of Madness fan alive and I will defend that movie with my life. I'd argue the Sam Raimi-ness of it is kind of what saved a script that had clearly been re-written 100 times. 


Love and Thunder just tried to do too much and it ended up being overstuffed. They had an interesting villain and a great performance from Bale and then just forgot to give him any real screen time because they had to deal with Jane, Valkyrie, Mjolnir, Thor, New Asgard, Zeus and Hercules, and hundred other things. If they cut 2-3 subplots, that movie could have been pretty good. I don't know how much of that was Taika's fault and how much of it was just dealing with the fact that it was the 4th movie in the series and they already had too much going on",2023-05-05
"Thor 4 isn‚Äôt Taika Unchained, it‚Äôs Taika not giving a shit. It almost feels like a film student trying to affect his style. All of his other movies (Ragnarok included, as well as Jojo Rabbit, his movie released closest to L&T) have this fantastic blend of heartfelt earnestness and comedy based in the situational rather than direct jokes, and for some reason Love and Thunder completely lacks his usual hand. My only guess is that something made him write it off, because everything else he‚Äôs done is leagues better.",2023-05-05
"The problem with Multiverse of madness wasn‚Äôt the direction, it was the writing. The direction was literally the best part.",2023-05-05

"Eh, I'm definitely in the camp that feels that MoM only worked BECAUSE it leaned so hard into the Raiminess of it all. I never expected an MCU movie to feel like Evil Dead 2 or Drag Me to Hell, but this pulled it off.",2023-05-05
MoM didn‚Äôt feel all that much like a zany Raimi film to me. You could feel his influence but it wasn‚Äôt that strong imo outside the horror aspects. Thor 4 yeah that one was too much of Taika. He over did it,2023-05-05
"If anything, MoM didnt have nearly enough of the director‚Äôs quirky thing.",2023-05-05

Compare rockets friends to Adam's mom. There's very little emotional stake in her death because who even are these characters?

We have no connection wuth them as characters, the mom was a glancing character in part 2 and adam is barely a character here.

The same is true for rockers friends. They are not actual characters. The have as much meaning or stake to us as adams mom, arguably less. The robot ferret is essentially just the *dead wife smiling under the bed covers* meme for all the extend to which she is an actual person in this film.

The only reason they elicit a stronger reaction is because they are cute animals. Hell, Gunn very clearly avoids giving them any meaningful characterisation because then their deaths would be excessive. 

And I get it. It's Marvel, its for families to be able to enjoy, it can't have any meaningful consequences for characters we actually care about (Yes, apart from Tony Stark). That's why they couldn't kill any actual characters off in this, why they couldn't even really kill off Gamora.

It would have been much better had the set pieces been the bio headquarters and then straight on to the high evolutionary's ship. 

The guardians would have had more time to talk without them having to shoe horn it in around PLOT!  

As it was, the constant dialogue in life and death situations made it seem like the characters don't care about their mortal peril so why should I as the audience?

Personally, I thought their final scene was fine. He acknowledges that she's a different person than the Gamora he loved and she acknowledges that even though she feels nothing for him that way, his relationship with the other Gamora was likely genuine and good. 

Also I was fine with the band breaking up. In a sense they weren't all saying their goodbyes. Aside from Quill and Mantis, they all still were living in knowhere. Nebula as city leader and Drax as surrogate father. They still see each other all the time presumably. And the it basically stated it wasn't goodbye for good. Just for now.",2023-05-07

Compare this to Ego, who just needed to be smug about putting a cancer in Quill's mom, and he's immediately hateable without trying so hard. Tryhard really is the best criticism I can think of.

"> Do we really need a clever twist or character curveball in the end of a trilogy and presumably end of the franchise?

Well, yes and no. I just wanted some extra depth to the backstory. After the first or second flashback I got the point, and figured there was going to be another dimension to this. Instead, we have shallow characters that only serve the purpose of looking cute so they can die and sadden Rocket further. Young Rocket himself also doesn't do anything interesting either. He has no agency and his one decisive moment is a last-ditch effort to save the creatures who'll die anyway. It's not interesting because he has nothing to lose by at least trying to set Lila and his friends free.

I know that I can't ask for much agency out of a character who is a literal slave, and that's why I think it was a fundamental misstep to spend so much time on these misery porn flashbacks in the first place. Felt like a cheap, dull way to emotionally charge the story IMO.

> I can‚Äôt think of a movie under that scenario where that‚Äôs happened.

"YES. I said this in another comment but the way I summed it up is that James Gun has Emotion Pacing problems in his movies.

Like I think he gets what emotions are but doesn‚Äôt really understand how normal humans perceive them. So it always just feels like this weird jumble‚Ä¶ 

LAUGH. CRY. ANGRY. GIGGLE. NOW SOB. NOW DANCE. 

I‚Äôve never liked his movies and I think this is what I pick up on‚Ä¶ like go watch the new Dungeons and Dragons movie, it has the same vibe as Marvel and James Gunn. But the emotions feel more authentic and thought out? So the experience feels more genuine.",2023-05-07

"Thank you for sharing, I agree with pretty much everything you said. I wouldn't consider myself a huge marvel fan either but I have definitely been invested in the franchise as a whole since it started with Iron Man. I feel like after Endgame nothing they have released has been particularly noteworthy, aside from Doctor Strange. I felt the same as now when No Way Home came out and everyone was loving that as well, while I felt like I was taking crazy pills for thinking it was just ok.

I agree that this movie shines with the smaller and more human moments, even the villain did nothing for me. And the scene where Quill was suffocating in space was exactly the same one from the previous movie, in that case he was saved by Yondu's sacrifice while now he was caught by Warlock.

They say something can be more than the sum of its parts, in the case of this movie I feel like the opposite is true if that makes sense.",2023-05-07

"It's worse in this case because the movie specifically calls it into question twice (and at least 1 indirectly) with different characters doing the sparing. I can give other movies a pass if they at least just let it go undiscussed.

EDIT: Also it isn't like other movies because in this scenario it's very clear that these are slaves that the High Evolutionary controls, they have some amount of personality and individuality but they all started off like Rocket and had no choice but to be controlled.",2023-05-05

They were having a blast eviscerating animals that got contorted and forced to kill.

"I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve fallen asleep if I tried with something exploding and screaming in my face every ten seconds. This was a series where the original climax was a dance off. It was funny and unique, this was just an ugly CGI mess like everything else marvel makes now. 

And James Gunn trying to squeeze in Disney channel lessons to the last half hour to try and give the characters rushed closure made it even worse. Rocket was the only one who got a real actual arc over the full movie. Like Drax is a dad because of his dead daughter, a plot line they dropped like seven years ago? 

Peter‚Äôs development could‚Äôve been so interesting here, his dead girlfriend coming back and being a different person, that‚Äôs such a deeply painful idea. But it gets sidelined for so much other nonsense.",2023-05-11

And now all of a sudden we‚Äôre supposed to like him and care that he‚Äôs on death‚Äôs door? Origin stories always irritate me. They‚Äôve hinted and outright explained Rocket‚Äôs time in labs. 

But when Nebula said ‚Äúit‚Äôs worse that what my father did to me‚Äù I just about walked out. She literally has had her body parts removed and replaced. And Rocket has cybernetic implants. But he still has his eyes. Ha ha. Animal cruelty is bad. But to try and make me care about characters that I know are going to die to serve as the narrative as to why Rocket is awful‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just so forced and contrived. Is having your friends killed around you after being experimented on justification to be a crass, generally irritating monster who thrives on carnage and destruction?",2023-05-13

"I dunno about that. We as an audience saw him get plucked out as a baby raccoon but his brain wasn't altered yet for him to have memory of that early time. 

So it's him learning what he actually is and where he came from for the first time. He was aware of the regular animals being used but clearly never saw his own species cage or connected the dots to what he was, despite being intelligent enough to. It's part of the situation he looked away from til that moment. Hence actually accepting the Raccoon moniker once he sees it's actually what he came from.

It's kind of a big character moment for him. Every movie Rocket expands who he cares about from 1 person (old Groot) to a group of people (the guardians)  to ""higher life forms"" (after the time in endgame) to living things in general. Not like he's totally softened. He's still not hesitating to shoot anything if they try to come at him or his friends.",2023-05-08

"Didn't mind. Made more sense than Thanos plan in a way. His motivation to get Rocket made sense. His own side creation something that was meant to be nothing something he wanted to discard turned out to be smarter and better than him and beat him. Or course it would be personal. Of course it would become obsession for him. It's completely understandable. It's not ego. ego was ego. HE is fueled by jealousy and obsession with perfection. To him, getting Rocket is him winning against Rocket and proving he was smarter than him all along.",2023-05-07

You could easily write a story with Gamora as Peter's love interest. You could also easily write one with Nebula, because as awkward as that scene was it did open a door that a writer could explore, especially given Nebula's character arc has been all about her learning to trust people and allowing herself to feel emotions.

But you could also just ignore both of those possibilities and write it off as ""new Gamora"" not being interested and that Nebula scene being an awkward one time conversation. The ambiguity of it all was really well done.",2023-05-08

"The Russians and nasa did quite a lot of experiments on this and if I recall correctly human should be able to survive about a minute or so in the vacuum of space and still be able to recover fully from it. Some of the biggest risks are lungs expanding if you don't exhale the air you have in them, if you have open wounds then blood will boil due to lack of pressure which can lead to cardiac arrest, and obvious lack of oxygen. The cold is less of an issue since there's very little heat transfer in a vacuum. Youll may get surface frostbite due to sweat boiling causing evaporative cooling, but that won't turn you into a block of ice as you see in the movies",2023-05-13
"I mean, space doesn't actually do that. It's vacuum, there's nothing for the heat to transfer to. The big problem in space is actually overheating, and the ice on his face would actually be any and all moisture rapidly boiling off. Survivors of vacuum chamber accidents report their last sensation being the saliva on their tongue flash boiling as they lost consciousness.

The swelling is fairly accurate, though. In accidental exposure to vacuum and near vacuum conditions, the exposed body parts became absolutely engorged with fluids, since there was no longer atmospheric pressure to contend with. I don't think it would have happened in seconds like that, though (and I'd be way more worried about his lungs filling with fluid).",2023-05-23

James Gunn put a lot of realistic moments in this movie of being on the receiving end of a cruel world and I know it won't change the ones who cause such pain because they can't relate.

Vol 1 he impulsively tries to assault a guard for grabbing his Walkman and gets mad at Yondu when he reminds him that he was abducted. Vol 2 he immediately takes a shot at his dad without hesitation after finding out he caused his mom's death. Vol 3 he gets extremely angry at Mantis for suggesting he go back to Earth, it takes him the entire film to accept that his Gamora is gone, and almost died trying to get his Zune back. I can totally buy him hitting Thanos in vain after learning that he killed his own daughter and the love of his life.",2023-05-05

And the girl at the end in the credits scene was picking a favourite song from the guardians set.

Most TV shows and movies will use boxes for actors to stand on so they can get faces in the same shot. A classic example was how Buffy the Vampire Slayer had Sarah Michelle Gellar frequently stand on a box to do scenes with David Boreanaz so they would both be in the frame. Another example is using riser shoes. Allegedly Tom Cruise would wear lifts to his shoes to appear taller in films. Robert De Niro has used them too.

It was Rocket‚Äôs chance at sweet vengeance, and he said no. I can appreciate your opinion but I do believe there is a distinction there.",2023-05-05
"I mean, the henchmen were actively fighting and threatening them with harm. Evolutionary lost and was no longer a threat. No need to even kill him anymore, and doing it just puts you beneath him. That's the way I saw it.",2023-05-05
I thought that was more Rocket letting him suffer while his creation literally exploded around him and killed him? Rocket wasn't going to give him the easy way out after what he'd done. He exposed the High Evolutionary as the imperfect being and left him to be tortured in his folly and pain rather than giving him a merciful death.,2023-05-05
Killing in an actively hostile situation vs killing in cold blood is the sort of nuance that GOTG1 Rocket would‚Äôve struggled with.,2023-05-06
"I mean, to be fair the henchmen were trying to kill them, and prevent them from rescuing the kids, whereas the HE was laying there defenseless, and pulling the trigger would have served no purpose but revenge",2023-05-05
It‚Äôs more about not killing a defenseless person. It‚Äôs not like they were stopping to double tap the bad guys they had knocked out. Big difference,2023-05-05
"I'm okay with this. He's not against killing if it's to protect others, and once they started killing that was pretty well established that they're fine doing that if they have to. Killing for revenge *is* something different than protection of oneself or others.

Edit: I see I'm not the first to have this opinion, but it also looks like you understand the thinking as well. Leaving it up because technically I'm now in agreement with you haha",2023-05-05
"I think it's all about perspective. The henchmen are killed instantly, their suffering ends, but the antagonist is left alive in agonizing pain, knowing he will die alone and that everything he has build is being destroyed.

Death is the easy way out.",2023-05-05
"I feel like that moment actually avoided that trope fairly well. Rocket already mauled the dude's face to pulp years ago (which is probably absolute torture on a daily basis for someone as narcissistic as the High Evolutionary). Rocket also had just proven that he was drastically smarter and stronger than his own ""creator"". I'd imagine a self-titled ""god"" having to live with all those thoughts in his last moments is much worse than just being shot.",2023-05-09
"I feel like it's a case of fighting someone and facing a hapless opponent. It's an honor thing. You can shoot an opposing soldier in the heat of battle, but if you shoot them after they have surrendered or if they have been incapacitated by injury it's a war crime.",2023-05-06
I think the implication is that there's a difference between killing out self defense and out of pure revenge and rage. I personally don't think it matters all that much but it's something I could see I guess.,2023-05-06
I think it was more about humiliating him than anything else,2023-05-06
"They didn't kill anyone who was clearly helpless, because that would inevitably read as much closer to murder than killing a bunch of mooks who were pointing, swinging or shooting weapons at them.

It's amazing that this common trope still causes difficulty.",2023-05-06
"It's mostly that trope, but they did immediately leave him to die in an exploding ship right after",2023-05-06

I guess the difference is that the bad guys are attacking them so it‚Äôs kill vs be killed. A weakened enemy on the floor is different,2023-05-07
There's a difference between killing someone in a fight and executing someone that's already beaten is the point I think.,2023-05-08
"I interpreted it as ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got better stuff to do, and you‚Äôre not worth killing, you‚Äôre too pathetic. And that‚Äôs the best revenge.‚Äù I wished they were more clear on that aspect.",2023-05-09
"The henchmen are fighting. It's a battle. 

But the high evolutionary is lying on the ground beaten. He's not threat at the moment.

Killing him in that instance is murder. However justified. And it shows rocket is a hero. The peice of shit tortured him, belittled him, ripped his entire beleif structure away from him and killed his friends. 

And rocket let him live. He showed mercy.",2023-05-09
"I felt it was more of it wouldve seemed just like an excessive execution from rocket, and to just leave him to the destruction of the ship. He knows HE is gonna die regardless, but he doesnt need to be the one to do it out of anger. Especially since HE was bleeding out and not a threat",2023-05-11
"well, most of the time yeah, but in this instance they were fighting through guards and monsters that were actively trying to kill them, full stop. They trashed the HE, and he was layed out already, just killing him at that point would have been an execution",2023-05-12
"They killed the people actively trying to kill them. After they bested the evolutionary, he was no longer a threat. There's a difference between self defense and executing someone.  I surely hope you can see that.",2023-05-10
"I think it was more of a expectation thing. Rocket defined himself as the one who will murder the High Evolutionary when he went on the ship, but resorted to instead go and save animals and children. Didn't want to let himself be defined by the past in a way. It works thematically for me, though i did wish that Quill would have just shot the HE.",2023-05-07
"They can't kill his character yet imo. There's so much more to do with it, maybe he will appear in Mount Wundagore somehow with Wanda. I think they are connected and she will rebuild it in exchange for him doing something for her.

I do think they should've given some explanation in the movie but it's implied that he would die in the crash.",2023-05-05
Kinda sets raccoon up to be the new captain of the guardians,2023-05-06
Yeah I was really hoping the movie would subvert that trope and have Rocket blast him at the last second.,2023-05-07
"At the risk of coming off as a psycho, there is honor in death and killing. All the henchmen actively posed a threat and thus they died as they lived, but the High Evolutionary at that point posed no threat he was sad pathetic little man that has already been beaten. It's far more impactful and subsequently crueler to just leave him to ""live"" with his mistakes crumbling around him. He's no longer worth the thought or the bullet it would take the give him the quick and easy.",2023-05-08
i thought he just wanted him to suffer on the floor,2023-05-14
"The henchman died fighting, while HE was defeated and at their mercy. At that point, it would have been a cold-blooded execution. They should have shown them carrying him off the ship, though.",2023-05-21

"Exactly. Don‚Äôt know why people fail to see this. In a danger situation, your survival instinct can make you kill someone (it‚Äôs still morally wrong), but there‚Äôs a huge difference between that and finishing off someone who is already neutralised and can‚Äôt by any means harm you. He had a chance to decide if he wanted to kill the HE and choose not to. In the fight against the henchmen, he had no time to make such a choice, because his own life was at risk.",2023-05-05
"Yeah.

Killing someone and murdering someone is not the same thing.",2023-05-05
"Quill even runs by those 3 henchmen and says, ""You can kill me but I'm your only way out of here!"" And they let him go, because he's not a threat either. And I assume they want to live. üòÑ",2023-05-05

"was it really though? His arc was more about running away from his past rather than wanting revenge. He was more than happy to pretend like none of this ever happened, he didnt tell anyone about it.

"During the movie there were moments when I would start to think the same about wanting more Rocket/Groot moments, but as soon as I would there would be small things to satisfy that. Other than when Groot went with Quill as backup, he was there for all of Rocket's important moments. The hug with Rocket/Quill, the first to turn with Rocket to head to the High Evolutionary, had Rocket fight on his shoulder in the hallway just like in the first movie. And then of course being the only original Guardian to join Rocket with the new team.

Their relationship being strong was subtle, but thinking on it more that made sense considering this version of Groot has spent just as much time with the other Guardians as with Rocket. But they still had a bond.",2023-05-05
"> By contrast we didn‚Äôt get enough recognition of Rocket and Groot‚Äôs relationship in my opinion.

Well James Gunn said it is not the same Groot as from GotG 1, more of his child. Not that Rocket shouldn't care for Groot, it's just not his buddy from his gangster era so the relationship is different.",2023-05-06
"Groot felt sorely... underused? Perhaps not underused but undercharacterized?  
Guardians 1 he was a standout, the gentle giant and like a moral force curving Rocket's explosive creativity. Yet since GOTG1, Groot has never been the same.

I know he is ""a different groot and not the same regrown"" but we got baby groot pretty much only for gags, teenage groot... again mainly for just gags, and now we have big staypuft Groot and he doesn't *feel* like a character. Just a... vessel. A vessel for guns? A vessel for making more jokes because of his perceived limited vocabulary? Yes. It made him actually talking in english at the end just feel flat to me.  


Groot has just lost all characterization and is more of a background element and an afterthought in this film where he originally was a strong hearted component of the group.",2023-05-05

"Adam Warlock being a literal plot device. Seriously, my golden boi only shows up when the plot needs to move forward. They even had a chance to develop him a bit more after his mom died and they didn't. After hyping him up at the end of Vol 2, it was a bit disappointing.

The first half of the movie had some really bad pacing between the funny and dramatic moments. The biggest standouts was during their infiltration of the brain station thing. One minute they are rolling everyone, then Drax and Mantis almost die, only to be saved by Peter rizzing the pink girl. 

Rocket saying he can't kill the High Evolutionary because he's a Guardian, ignoring all the henchmen that they just killed who, like him, were also probably there against their will as test subjects. And leaving him to die in the explosion anyways. This is just my opinion, but it would've been more impactful if he had killed him to avenge his friends, who the High Evolutionary didn't even acknowledge as living beings.",2023-05-05
"Not the person above you, but for me OrgoCorp felt a bit too Rick & Morty-like. (Whether or not that's bad is a matter of preference of course) I also thought it was weird that the High Evolutionary decided to blow up the planet after his War Pig had obtained Rocket, but before the War Pig made it onto the ship. That's like sitting in the getaway car at a heist, hearing that your fellow thieves inside the vault managed to get their hands on a bag of money and then blowing up the bank.",2023-05-07
"Another MCU director got to complete his trilogy as well this year with Peyton Reed closing his Ant-Man trilogy but it doesn't feel as impactful and memorable as the GOTG movies. The Ant-Man movies are funny for sure, but to me it feels inconsequential and forgettable. And it happened because Quantumania served mostly as a springboard for the future of the MCU and this movie felt like an isolated movie separate from the MCU and a proper closure to the Guardians. I'm so glad this movie released when it did because maaaan, watching these MCU movies and TV shows was starting to feel like a chore.",2023-07-11
It sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. But more often it works if they let the director work the script and movie. Ryan Coogler wrote and directed both BP movies and they were really good. Gunn obviously did all the Guardians. And then Taika did Thor 3 and 4. I think the only other one that had relatively little intervention might have been Eternals cause that was entirely a Chloe Zhao styled movie.,2023-05-21

It's *just* a tribute to Chadwick Boseman. That movie is absolutely pregnant with his absence and all I can think about is how sad it is that Chadwick Boseman is dead.

"Nah, there's no way Alt-Gamora and Peter could have ever had a normal relationship with that baggage.  There would always be some insecurity about the differences between her and the original Gamora, and with Peter having sort of an ""advantage"" of knowing more about her than she knows about him.  

The buildup in the movie was more about them being able to respect each other so they can make peace with what happened and what is gone.  Peter can understand that she is a person with a different history and different experiences than his Gamora and that 50% of the relationship isn't there.   She can make peace with the fact that her other self chose well.

I liked the end where we see that the ""family"" bond she had developed with the Guardians in the original timeline happened all over for her with a different team in this one.",2023-05-05

I don‚Äôt know how Peter survived that. He lost all his powers correct? Or is he still part celestial?,2023-05-05
"I've been thinking about this for the past few hours now, and i want to say this must of been a creative decision from a few different people.  

Basically, the scene is too on the nose like the scene from Vol.1 that it was for sure a call back.  However, there is two conflicts with having gamora saving him.. maybe 3.   One is that it's not really in character for the ""new"" Gamora to save Peter like that, so early after this small adventure.  It would feel out of place, rushed.  The second is that it's also just too.. tropey?  Campy?  even for guardians to just do the same scene again.  If it was the ""original"" Gamora, i would be fine with it, but the new one?  I'm not with it either.

The third is the strongest argument, and that it was a ""Disney"" decision to make it Adam Warlock, because he's the new character of the movie, semi-big name along with the cast, and now part of the actual new Guardians of the galaxy.  They didn't do much with him in the movie (which was fine, i guess) so they needed him to do something in the finale.

Plus, gotta have that [Famous ""God"" pointing painting reference](https://static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/31862.gif?q=50&fit=crop&w=960&h=500&dpr=1.5) joke, because Adam Warlock is basically a Demi-god in a few timelines.",2023-05-05

"Hard disagree.

While Hemsworth can play a himbo idiot, the best iteration of Thor is one where he can actively be taken seriously by everyone around him. In every movie except Love and Thunder, when Thor talks to people, he sounds like a cognitive and mature adult, even in parts of Endgame, when he was at his most broken and manchildish.

Love and Thunder largely suffers from Thor being a himbo, since it makes a lot  of conflict with him involved an actual joke. Fight on New Asgard, being jealous of the new Thor having his hammer. Meeting about the damage having been done to the city, suddenly not a great leader in any capacity. Meeting with the other Gods, literally made a sex object. It wasn't anywhere near that bad in Ragnarok, either.

Nonetheless, Taika's hands were all over it and I feel like a little more oversight could have cleaned up some of the bigger issues (Korg, screaming goats, the overabundance of comedy, etc.)

I agree that the focus should have been more on the God-Butcher, but Lady Thor's inclusion wasn't this huge detractor from it. The impact was nulled by Thor's character responding to things like a child.",2023-05-05
Exactly my point. Letting a director take the ball and roll with it can result in things like this.,2023-05-05
"I found that the worst parts of Eternals were when it stepped away from being a Zhao movie and just became ""Marbel movie #27."" That felt a lot rarer in this one, which really did just feel like Gunn making his own movie.",2023-05-05
Eternals would have been way cooler as an hour long TV series. I enjoyed a lot of the concepts but it felt too full. Hard with that big of a cast.,2023-05-08
I feel the same way. Feels good to know there's at least one other person who loves MoM.,2023-05-05
I'm there with you on Raimi going full Raimi zany is what made the movie worth watching and Thor was really two decent movies with very different tones smashed together.,2023-05-05
">I'm probably the biggest Multiverse of Madness fan alive and I will defend that movie with my life. I'd argue the Sam Raimi-ness of it is kind of what saved a script that had clearly been re-written 100 times.

Amen! The best parts of the movie were the parts where they let him loose and it's obvious that was mostly held to stylistic flourishes on top of a simultaneously overworked and undercooked script.",2023-05-05
"Yeah, Multiverse of Madness isn't the greatest MCU movie, but it at least stands out for being something different than what's become the norm with these (Eternals, Love & Thunder, and Quantumania all felt like kind of 'nothing new' to me). MoM is enjoyable in it's uniqueness.",2023-05-05
"Based. Sam Raimi brought real style, fun and creativity to an okay script. The movie shines because of him.",2023-05-06
"Raimi and co. have basically said outright that they didn‚Äôt get a lot of time to polish MoM‚Äôs script, and there was some relatively 11th hour restructuring of it.",2023-05-05
Multiverse was great. I‚Äôm legitimately surprised people don‚Äôt like. It was Sam Raimi doing Sam Raimi and I was there for it,2023-05-05
"We just fundamentally disagree on MoM so I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs any productive conversation to be had there

I personally love Taika‚Äôs stuff usually, but I feel like he was too off the reigns with Thor 4. Totally agree with your complaints, but even if they had been fixed I think there‚Äôs be a fair amount of criticism for the overstuffing of Taika humor. Korg as a weird framing device, the goats screaming, etc‚Ä¶ a bunch of the humor that was too overdone is very much a consistent thing through his projects even outside of the MCU and I feel like he missed the mark that time.",2023-05-05
"Agreed.


MoM was great, particularly because it was like a horror film set in the MCU [rather than a comic movie].


Love and Thunder just leaned to heavily into the quirky Taika schtick! I usually like his stuff, but it seemed out of place and forced as hell.",2023-05-05

"While I agree in part with the Cap Trilogy, I'd say as Spider-Man films, the Holland Trilogy didn't have him really be the character until the 3rd film prior films were more about his fascination and fixation with Tony Stark which to me is something I can't forgive.

It'd be GotG 1a, Cap 1b just because all the GotG films are self contained for the most part while Cap was trying to incorporate other story lines involving other Avenger Characters.",2023-05-05
"All the Spider-Man and captain America films are good, don‚Äôt get me wrong, however they are far from self contained.

20 minutes too long, pacing was disjointed and all over the place, weak soundtrack.

Compared to Vol. 2 especially, I thought the balance between serious moments and quips was pretty good. The dark moments were truly dark and devastating, and none of them were undercut with a lame joke. Characters like Drax and Mantis, who I thought were bordering on obnoxious in Vol. 2, were toned down. They were more relatable while still having some good jokes.

The villain wasn‚Äôt super deep, but I thought his motives were interesting and he was truly fun to watch. As opposed to Ronan from the first movie who was very dull, generic, and had no connection to the main characters.",2023-06-01

It sounded old, but 1000 years ago, or 2000, not 5000 years ago.  As if it was taking place in mystical-future-space land, 3000 years in the future.  Which *is* the setting of the ""Guardians"" comic book, but not the movie.  The movie took place in a galaxy far, far away, but at the same time as the other movies.  Not the future.

Edited in:  I think it *is* fictional space alien music, after all.  Called Mo Ergaste Forn, by the film's background music writer.",2023-05-05

And surprisingly dark in ways, like you said, that felt jarring against some of the lighter stuff. Some great moments but plenty of beats that just didn‚Äôt land for me and I was surprised how unsettled and uncomfortable i felt in a marvel movie of all things. 

Maybe it‚Äôll feel different on rewatch or when Im not a little high but yeah was expecting a tighter film.",2023-05-05
"I definitely still enjoyed it (overall) but I wish they‚Äôd done different with the editing. 

Like, I couldn‚Äôt even relax and sit in the moment when rocket found the baby raccoons because I just KNEW there was gonna be some weird ass jump scare to mess up the tone of a really tender moment - and I was right! I wish this movie allowed more breathing room between the different tones. The scenes didn‚Äôt ‚Äúflow‚Äù cohesively together. 

I think GOTG1 and 2 are much more well rounded movies but this one has a lot of emotional heavy moments.",2023-05-05
"I‚Äôm not sure honestly. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say he wanted to tell his story about Rocket, but that story wasn‚Äôt really a good conclusion for the Guardians as a whole, so he shoe horned in the team breaking up to make this seem like an ending. Without that kind of out of nowhere break up though, nothing about this movie really comes off as a ‚Äúfinale‚Äù. 

As to why this had to be the end for the Guardians films, I‚Äôm not sure. I get that this series is kind of Gunn‚Äôs baby, but we saw in Infinity War and Endgame how well these characters can be portrayed by other writers/filmmakers. I hope Gunn wasn‚Äôt trying to prevent others from using these characters again, because it would feel like a waste to never see any of the Guardians besides Star Lord again.",2023-05-07

When did she leave them, and how did she end up leading the Ravagers? Just sort of confused about how she got to that point. My issues with the way Gamora (and Quill's reaction to her) were handled are plentiful and likely far too much to dig into in this comment. But overall i see your point and ill try to think on it some more. Im still left feeling pretty sad by the ending of the movie and Im not super happy about it.

"It does make sense!  It was kind of like watching a D&D campaign. The side quests were unexpected and fun, but the boss battle associated with one player‚Äôs backstory was always an obvious conclusion. But unlike a D&D campaign, the boss battle never really had any tension.

The way I saw it, there were fragments that had something really special that would have probably been hard to sell to execs, and the wider punchy punchy huggy huggy muahahaha atmosphere was a dilution to satisfy commercial interests. Would be interesting to get an inside scoop from James Gunn to see which ideas were completely his. I could be completely off base, but I assume the situation with marvel and other franchises is similar to the format for exploitation films. If you read about old B movie horror (like 1940s) you‚Äôll find loads of stories of directors and writers trying to do something artistic, or different (Val Lewton in particular), and getting hampered by producers laying down the law about simple stories, audience expectation and getting their money‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs typical for film in general obviously! But I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a uniform list of requirements any marvel movie needs to hit to be cleared for release. Presumably Gunn did his best to fulfil that brief, hence the sum being worth less than the parts.

Step two:  Suffer.  Most films made since 2016 suck.  

Step three:  You don't want to reward studos making the same mistakes time after time, and you don't want the AMC app to know that you patronize the films from a studio you no longer trust.  So, use your subscription service to get tickets to the one film that's actually good this month, but walk into a showing of GOTG 3, instead of the film showing at the same time you have tickets for.",2023-05-05

"You asked if anyone died.  But I believe that you actually *meant* that as referring to the *main* characters.

Like the people on the other side of the exploding planet.  I linked to a tvtropes article about that phenomenon in other works of fiction.

It seemed based on the internal logic of the movie that the gravity boots just negated gravity and made its own. It worked for zero G keeping them on the floor and to turn off gravity so Rocket could walk on the ceiling in the beginning. You could also argue he was shocked that rocket was able to even negate his powers for a little and that let him get shot and unable to fight well,2023-05-16

The High Evolutionary on the other hand, was more of a psychopathic OCD perfectionist who seemed to just want an excuse to cover for his experiments.  Also, sometimes villains just don‚Äôt need a huge backstory like that, they‚Äôre just better off being evil just because.  Their job in this movie was to make the High Evolutionary completely despicable and they definitely did that",2023-05-08

It's not lazy writing in my book. There's so many real world people who simply want to play in a sandbox. People have no qualms demolition their cities in video games with meteors and tsunamis. Is it hard to believe that the next step up would be someone so sociopathic that they can do the same with real people?

I think the only reason he was in this movie is because Gunn teased him in Vol 2 and had to deliver.,2023-05-07
"I enjoyed him being a bit of a parallel of Rocket. Both are created by the HE to be a ""perfect"" specimen, and both of them manage to realize the truth of how big a scumbag the HE is, then choose their own destiny. Having a young warlock watch his mother murdered by the HE works well to tie the current story to the flashbacks beyond the ""save rocket"" angle.

 the story could've stayed pretty similar without him, but I always like when super hero movies introduce different ""factions"" of characters with different motives beyond good guys and bad guys, just to throw a wrench into a straightforward story. Knowing he could show up and fuck someone up at any moment was an extra point of tension and gave us that sweet scene of gamora in the shop on counter-earth.",2023-05-15
"He was totally pointless and felt like something Feige or Disney wanted introduced, but I assume they're getting him ready for the next round.

So he'd have to abandon them there to die and only save himself.

"I think his issue is it made Quill look stupid and irresponsible, and just generally they made the guardians all look a bit naive and like a joke at the expense of their characters own integrity.

Thats how I feel about it anyway.",2023-05-06
"The thing is while all of those examples reinforce his impulsive nature,  there's also examples of his selfless nature and being able to do the responsible thing when the time calls for it. He's the one trying to get the team to save the galaxy in the first film despite them being so utterly outmatched by Ronan. When the fate of the galaxy is on the line again, Gamora asks Peter to kill her if it ever comes to that, and he mustered the strength to do it.


The idea of Thanos killing Gamora to begin with was never an impossibility in Peter's mind. He was firmly established as the worst person in the galaxy just from Gamora telling him how she even met the guy. The same can't be said for Peter's father, who straight up murders his mother. And yes, that was a galaxy-threatening scenario, but the consequences for Peter's immediate response to kill rather than maybe plan something out cost him the life of Yondu. 


IW serves to just reinforce his rashness tenfold. It feels like the script was written in a way where the loss had to be on one of the heroes, so lets look at who we can pin the blame on - lets go with those lesser known people.",2023-05-05
I agree I just wish in that IW scene instead of gun whipping thanos he starts blasting instead.  Makes his rage seem more intense and be an actual effort towards killing the guy instead of being incompetent.  As seen in the movies we know he goes for the kill.,2023-05-06
I can agree with most of this but cmon now...he *pistol whipped* the most powerful being in the universe rather than just shooting him in the face?,2023-05-05
"He‚Äôs impulsive but those are all also *very* different situations. Like I might be impulsive and punch someone for saying something fucked up but if someone is holding a gun and says something fucked up I‚Äôm probably going to react differently. Ego was trying to get Peter to kill all his friends and the rest of the universe which Quill was already hesitant to go along with despite the hypnotism thing. Shooting Ego doesn‚Äôt possibly kill half the universe, if anything it helps save the universe.",2023-05-05
"Hard agree. I thought that was actually a great use of one of Peter's clear character flaws. I think it was very good usage of the traits Gunn had put on screen. 

I can certainly understand why he might not like it. But, it was good characterization.",2023-05-08

"No I think either could have worked, it's how it's done that counts. Everyone surviving can seem a bit on the nose but Gunn did a good job here by showing an enemy that was biting off a bit more than he can chew.

He was just dangerous enough to give the guardians a hard time but not dangerous enough to kill them and Gunn showed that pretty well with his script. The ending became more about trying to save everyone on the ship on time and less about fighting the high evolutionary and when the moment came to actually tangle it was done in seconds. 

This story fitted well with the ""everyone"" surviving arc. Had a much more dangerous enemy been the antagonist it might have been a bit weird.",2023-05-08

"*Cough*, Optimus",2023-05-20
"From the stabbing, the shooting, and the deliberately leaving him there defenseless and wounded on an exploding ship, what they did was functionally an execution, and a cruel one at that. Would‚Äôve been the merciful route just to have killed him outright, instead they chose to let him suffer until the end. No need to rationalize sparing antagonists as signification of some reified moral superiority, because that platitude rarely holds under any scrutiny.",2023-05-11
I‚Äôd be cool with him being kept alive if done well but I just think Rocket suddenly and momentarily thinking killing was bad with one of the most purely evil guys he‚Äôs faced is weak,2023-05-05

Killing someone coming at you that has experienced the exact same type of trauma that you have?

Even if he is a monster, Thanos never thought of himself as one. Everything he did, he did with purpose, even if that purpose was misguided and evil.

I don't know about vol 3, or the infinity movies. And it's possible that Gunn (director) might have tools to even further tweak the performance, so definitely a team effort for the cgi characters (voice, motion capture, animator, director).",2023-05-18

EDIT: which I think is fine and the movie is pretty good. It was a great send off for the Guardians crew.

What I'm getting at is that I've enjoyed the MCU, but things are starting to get old. This was a nice little send off for my devoted personal attachment.

Not sure I get your point. There‚Äôs plenty of stuff that happens every day that doesn‚Äôt automatically make for a good movie.,2023-05-05
"I mean it literally introduced those characters for the sole purpose of making us sad. All they talked about was being friends and someday being free. Surely you saw from a mile away that they were just there to get killed. If this was the first film and we didn‚Äôt already understand Rocket‚Äôs through excellent characterization I‚Äôd agree with you. Like did you come into the third movie and *discover* that rocket had a traumatic past where he was experimented on? Or did you already have all the information you needed to make him a 3-Dimensional character 2 movies ago and this one just beat you over the head with HOW traumatic his back story was? Rocket‚Äôs characterization has made be tear up in the first 2 movies, this just made me roll my eyes and want to yell ‚ÄúI get it!!‚Äù I‚Äôd much rather have seen a movie where he was an active participant and had character development versus being a mcguffin and subject of a bunch of flashbacks that tell us what we already knew.",2023-05-06
"Everything you mentioned was either subtextual or just presented better by the narrative in their respective movies. I was also fine with it when I knew rocket had been taken apart and put back together as what he was. 

My issue is a good chunk of a movie‚Äôs runtime jamming it down my throat with the cutest friendliest sidekicks I know from the get-go were only introduced to do something fucked up to, so I‚Äôll know the bad guy is bad. It‚Äôs just done so heavy handed. If a quarter of Vol 2‚Äôs runtime was extended flashbacks of Ego getting alien women pregnant then murdering their children on screen so we knew he was villainous after we already knew he was the villain, yeah, I‚Äôd have thought that was lame too.",2023-05-05
"I literally mentioned that all filmmaking is manipulative but it‚Äôs off putting when it‚Äôs done so clumsily you can see it being crammed down your throat. Red hanging himself in Shawshank is playing with my emotions, sure. Jackson hanging himself in A Star us Born and having his dog pawing at the garage in the next shot is tragedy porn. 

Movies don‚Äôt need to be sterile. I‚Äôve seen uncomfortable stuff and some of the most challenging is when it‚Äôs based on a true story so you can‚Äôt shed it as not real but what‚Äôs in Vol 2 just felt juvenile. Doing fucked up stuff to animals is such low hanging fruit that it has to be done well. Specifically animating animals to give them kids voices and bigger, shinier eyes and have them almost exclusively talk about how great friends are and how nice it will be to be free when we know from the first frame of the movie they are just trauma fodder is manipulation you can see a mile away. 

We‚Äôve known since the first one that rocket had a traumatic past that he tried to hide but obviously carried with him in ways even he wasn‚Äôt aware of.  There is zero nuance or trust in the audience when an adorable otter with its arms ripped off and replaced with robot limbs getting shot in front of him as she literally talks about being his friend the instant he freed her just so we *really* know rocket has trauma, which had already been illustrated through excellent characterization and narrative.",2023-05-05

I think it's important that for Supes' fiest outing he has a character foil that helps him find what he stands for. Lobo can come in the next film as a way to match his power level, but I think if they are going to do a series of films, it's important they put Supes head to head with Lex first and then let Lex outsource his dirty work in the later films.",2023-05-07

Why he sees said friend in his near death experience.

The deaths are what lead him to attack mask guy, to escape, and ultimately to seek him out, kill him, and free other animals from similar fate.

You don't have to like it, but that's the movie. Don't know what you were watching.

Edit: nevermind that the supposed fundamental characters who have shaped him are never even remotely alluded to at any other point, in any other movie before now.

It was entirely unnecessary but it seems like they knew people would be there to see rocket and I‚Äôll bet they had some kind of poll testing that showed kids identified with rocket the most so they installed a kronenberg Pixar movie in the middle of it. 

Agreed on the sound track. The CGI was definitely not up to par. I think this whole film is a victim of scope creep so they ended up with a poll-tested, built for trailer, weak movie that frankly is completely unlike the previous films in the series.",2023-05-06

It‚Äôs possible that all his treatments to prolong his life come at the cost of not being able to be operated on with normal technology.

Another explanation is that he was choosing to leave his face like that until he killed Rocket as a constant reminder of his goal.

Or he might have enjoyed wearing the mask, either as a symbol of unattainable perfection or as a means of intimidating his staff.

Definitely isn‚Äôt a plot hole in any case. Pick whichever interpretation you prefer. (Although you can argue that the film should‚Äôve explained it, which is a valid criticism even if I disagree.)",2023-05-06

The attraction she had for Peter was sparked by the very specific interactions they had in the first 2 movies, interactions that this version of Gamora will never have.   It can never be the same because she'll always have the elephant in the room of Peter expecting her to fall in love with him again based on a relationship she never experienced or participated in.  It would never be an equal relationship of two people who have had all the same experiences together, and there would always be a sense of insecurity.  If they ever had a fight or disagreement and there's an implication that it's because of an unfair expectation by Peter based on his past with the original Gamora, that just would be hella awkward.

They aren't soul mates, time's not immutable, etc.  They don't need to be together.  This Gamora went from 2014 prior to meeting Quill to now having spent 3 years with the Ravagers.

"> The scene where Gamora finally understood Groot was slightly strange (how did she catch on so quickly?)

I know I'm a month late, but how I understand it is that how Groot communicates isn't a 'language, it's sound connected to something mental.  If you are connected to Groot, you get the full message, but if you aren't, he's saying ""I am Groot"".  

So when Gamora was suddenly in his 'friends', she instantly gained understanding.

I think the villain is another ""I'm evil for the sake of being evil"" which I usually have trouble with as well. 

I thought the bad guys just experimenting on children and animals was cheap tbh, just an explicitly bad guy thing to do and plainly emotionally manipulative.

However I overall did like the movie. I thought the Guardians themselves did a really good job as did Adam Warlock and it's cool to see how well they work off each other. Pom Klementieff, Dave Bautista, and Zoe Saldana I thought were superb and added a lot of weight to their storylines. I liked the ending of Gamora and Quill going their separate ways, I thought that was a really smart way of finishing up their storyline.

I also thought the humor was great and the action was often incomprehensible, though the hallway ""No Sleep til Brooklyn"" scene was one of the best MCU action scenes so it evens out. Overall good movie but I just thought some parts were lacking",2023-05-05

"I think given the past 2 movies it had to be sad. If we didn‚Äôt fully understand the weight of what Rocket was carrying around or the backstory didn‚Äôt make you feel emotional, it would‚Äôve cheapened what we‚Äôve come to know about Rocket this far. Like for 2 movies we know that Rocket came from somewhere awful and it led him to be this broken character that needed to heal when we met him. If the takeaway in this movie was ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt so bad‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why that was so bad‚Äù then rockets journey up until now would‚Äôve felt unearned.",2023-05-06

"You are significantly downplaying it. The whole point of the backstory is the high evolutionary dedicated his life to making the perfect version of humity. One that can think for themselves, create incredible pieces of art, free of bigotry violence and hate.

And he does that with rocket. But since he can't get past Rocket's outer appearance his mangled body, he turns Rocket into the very thing he hates humanity for. It's a great tragic story that ties all the plot points and themes together.

It blows my mind you ignored all that subtext and narrow it down to animal cruelty. It sounds like you were just looking for a reason to hate the movie.",2023-05-07
"""nevermind that the supposed fundamental characters who have shaped him are never even remotely alluded to at any other point, in any other movie before now.""

It's been made pretty clear over the course of 3 movies that Rocket made it a point to never talk about his past or what happened to him. It's such a traumatic event to him that even re-living it reminds him of the pain he's been escaping. He doesn't want to relive it, it's why he's always pushed everyone way and tried to not get close to anyone because the furst family he ever was close to was violently and cruelly taken away from him. He's tried to run from his pain ever since and never really process or deal with it. 

The closest we get to him opening up is when he's drunk on Knowhere in the first film and says ""I didn't ask to get made! I didn't ask to be torn apart and put back together over and over and turned into some little...monster!"" He hates himself and sees himself as a freak because that's what HE told him he was and ever since he's put on a false bravado to make sure he feels anything but. 

It's normal emotional trauma coping. Some people go through awful, horrible experiences and they never want to talk to live through them again and just bury it and ignore it.

The only reason he's happy with his friends is because they are all they have and they are under the false pretense that they are going to the new world together.

The boiling throughout the body stops blood from pumping, the main thing killing you. It also causes swelling, but skin is great and holds you together well.

"> Something tells me he didn't like that decision.

He was definitely unhappy with that and a few other decisions made as well. Funnily enough though it is weirdly comic accurate in a meta way. There's little turf wars and a lack of coordination between desks all the time, and sometimes big crossover events come along and make a change to the status quo that writers just suddenly have to deal with halfway through their run. The best ones find a way to take those curveballs and work with it and I do think Gunn managed to deal well with Infinity War/Endgame clearly tampering with his original plans for GOTG.

Doesn't make it better for the script as it would require more explanation, but it still remains very illogical that he would give the woman he loved ""torture and death"" instead of ""quick death.""",2023-05-08

">The attraction she had for Peter was sparked by the very specific interactions they had in the first 2 movies, interactions that this version of Gamora will never have.

&#x200B;

>This Gamora went from 2014 prior to meeting Quill to now having spent 3 years with the Ravagers. And now Quill wants her to continue a relationship with a guy she doesn't know in place of a different person? Imagine some person you don't know telling you that you had been dating for 4-5 years and pressuring you to continue that relationship.

That's pretty much what happened with her and Nebula though. Pre- Guardians Nebula hated Gamora and the sisterly bond the two had forged by Infinity War happened entirely with alternate timeline Gamora. None of that stopped the current version from happily jumping into that bond however.

They even had her gained knowledge of this fact(that they were close now) be the thing that tipped her over to the side of the Avengers in Endgame. That's **OVER** the gained knowledge that Thanos does something terrible to her.

Point being that its less about her needing to have had the experiences that served as the foundation for a particular relationship and more about whether its something she wants. If everything she heard about what her relationship with Peter was like sounded like the kind of relationship she'd always yearned for, she'd have probably given it a shot.

&#x200B;

>It can never be the same because she'll always have the elephant in the room of Peter expecting her to fall in love with him again based on a relationship she never experienced or participated in. It would never be an equal relationship of two people who have had all the same experiences together, and there would always be a sense of insecurity. If they ever had a fight or disagreement and there's an implication that it's because of an unfair expectation by Peter based on his past with the original Gamora, that just would be hella awkward.

All of these are maturity issues not problems inherent to a second-try relationship where one party has no memory of the previous go. And I don't think you can even necessarily make the argument that either of them have been depicted as lacking the maturity to avoid the problems you list. If peter can get over his need for current timeline Gamora to be *his* Gamora over the course of the movie, he can get over it over it in a relationship.",2023-06-07

"Maybe there‚Äôs a misunderstanding of what I mean.

You know how sometimes movies or shows joke when a cop or soldier or whatever dies and he was a day from retirement? It‚Äôs because it was an overused trick. At one point that specific detail was pretty original and gutted the audience. But it became a cheap shortcut to the point that were all aware of the trope even if we‚Äôve never seen any actual media that used that story beat earnestly. 

It‚Äôs the same reason we roll our eyes when a Disney character has lost at least one parent. It‚Äôs manipulative because it‚Äôs an obvious shortcut to pull the audience‚Äôs heart strings. Every movie is manipulative in nature, it‚Äôs how they get us to feel real emotions over fake circumstances but it can be done with subtlety 

So far rockets backstory has only been hinted at but it‚Äôs been very effective. As a character he‚Äôs made me choke up or full on cry in each movie. In another comment someone kind of my my point for me when they said that the scene of implied cruelty to rocket was the most graphic. Violence can‚Äôt be implied *and* graphic. What they were expressing is that the implied cruelty was the most effective. That‚Äôs essentially what I‚Äôm trying to say about the tragedy of rockets flashbacks. Creating 3 adorable new characters who are introduced just in time to talk about how great it is to have friends and what they‚Äôll do when they‚Äôre free. Gee I wonder if they‚Äôll get gunned down as soon as they‚Äôre loose. It‚Äôs heavy handed and could have been done in a way more effective way than beating us over the head with a sad shortcut we see coming a mile away.",2023-05-05
"Definitely. My issue isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs sad. It‚Äôs that all of the Guardians pathos has been handled so well and so precisely and subtly then this just hits you with a sledgehammer. Do you feel like you understand Drax‚Äôs trauma pretty well? Like, are you totally in the dark about what his deal is? Would you need a Guardians 4 that spends half the runtime showing his wife and daughter taking about how great it is to be alive and how much they can‚Äôt wait to all grow together as a family when you know from frame one of the movie they‚Äôre not going to make it. In trying so hard to pull at my heartstrings with rockets past it actually cheapened it for me because I‚Äôve seen it handled way better through his own actions than through the grimy details like this.",2023-05-06
"My issue isn't that his past was traumatic. It's that it was written in a way that was transparently designed to overtly and obviously manipulate the audience's emotions. We're introduced to rockets cute animal friends who are created to suffer, talk about literally how great it is to have friends, share how wonderful it will be to be free of their cages and then die in front of him. The other movies have handled his past trauma with such scrupulousness then this one comes in with a bulldozer. 

And why are we even spending this much time on Rocket's backstory in the trilogy capper? I didn;t know every grimy detail but I knew enough to know his deal. Why are we looking backward this far in the last Guardians movie? I've known his story was traumatic through his characterization for 2 movies. I would have been equally pissed if in the final film of the trilogy, Drax was asleep for 2/3 of the runtime and we got a bunch of miserable flashbacks with the ready-made sadness of his Daughter dying in a bid to pull at our heartstrings. Extended scenes of her talking about how she can't wait to grow up and how she's sho happy Drax is her dad. We don't need it because we already get it and we certainly don't need it laid on that thick. Not at the end of the story. 

 What I wanted was the ""one last ride"" premise we were promised instead of a Rocket Raccoon bottle episode beating me over the head with sap establishing why Rocket was the way he was at the start of his arc 2 movies ago.",2023-05-11
"Yeah I didn‚Äôt say my issue what that it‚Äôs graphic. It‚Äôs just narratively heavy handed.

Edit: The scene you mention (the most graphic scene being implied is an oxymoron btw) was more effective and nuanced than all the flashbacks because it had emotional weight to the other characters and thus us the audience.

I don't think interfering in movies is really their problem.

">I can understand it framing to be Jane's movie, but seeing how there were no future projects/plans with her (on account of her dying) and seeing how Thor is a larger part of the conflict and has a stronger connection to the villain (being a god and all), making him take it a little more seriously, especially considering that the foe is literally killing Gods, would have strengthened the film substantially.

This is thinking in terms of a franchise and not in terms of the individual movie. Jane had a real character arc and Thor didn't. Jane became a God in this movie and she should have had just as much of a connection to the villain as Thor. Her dying at the end makes the movie stronger if she's the real protagonist, not weaker. 

Also she did show up in Valhalla at the end so I wouldn't say it's impossible that she comes back in some future movie with multiverse shenanigans or something",2023-05-05

"Yeah, I didn‚Äôt really buy the reasoning for any of the characters leaving the team honestly. Like you mentioned, Peter was just taking some time off, there was no reason to permanently hand over leadership to Rocket. He had also never shown any particular fondness for Earth or his Grandpa prior to, and even during this film. His desire to go back and visit his grandpa seems to come entirely from Mantis telling him he should. 

Mantis as well had never shown any indication of wanting to leave, and kind of flies in the face of the Christmas Special, which went out of it‚Äôs way to show how important the team and Peter were to her. Her reasoning for wanting to leave also didn‚Äôt make much sense. She wanted ‚Äúfind herself‚Äù and make her own decisions, but that was something she already basically did when she left Ego to join the Guardians. Her freedom was never restricted as part of the Guardians. 

Drax and Nebula leaving also doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense since the Guardians were already headquartered on Knowhere, so they could have done their new jobs and still been a part of the team in some capacity. Hell, Nebula was already taking care of shit on Knowhere even at the start of the movie while still being a Guardian. Also, aren‚Äôt Kraglin and Cosmo some kind of leaders on Knowhere? Yet they are still on the team, so clearly there is no conflict. 

All in all the team breaking up just felt super forced, and didn‚Äôt really make sense for any of the characters. It feels like something that was shoehorned in to make this seem like ending. Honestly, cut out the abrupt breakup scene, and you‚Äôd never guess this film was supposed to be the conclusion to a trilogy.",2023-05-08

Peter who finds about his mother and father and finally understands he has a family in the guardians and lastly Drax who is probably the most self assured character who is infectiously happy while he keeps all his pain to himself.

I think that given the stakes he would be more prone to:

1) Hit him fatally 
2) Help take of the gauntlet while on a rage, like shooting his arm or trying to cut it off or something like that

I agree he would react violently and irrationally, but hitting him in the face at those stakes is just kinda stupid

"because in the grand scheme of things it was something that no matter how they did it, it would haunt every subsequent movie in the marvelverse. future writers shouldn't be subjected to adhering to some weird fantasy plot device that happened years ago, but has to be mentioned just because of the absolute ridiculousness of it, so that it's tied nicely into the greater ""multiverse"" backdrop of each and every movie that's made in the future. 

but this is really just the same problem since the inception of the comic-form storytelling in a cinematic continuity. early on it was cool because it was really clean and air-tight, and there was thorough planning behind it, and it had never been done this way before, so there was a novel coolness to it as well. there was only like 3 heroes with their solo movies, the big crossover teamup, then guardians. 

but now it's truly an incomprehensible mess to anyone who hasn't been following, and tbh it's probably just as confusing to plenty of people who have managed to catch the bulk of these movies. most of the movies exist as stepping stones, half-baked stories with no regard for character or writing or themes, that only exist as chess pieces in the greater plan or to fit as a piece of the puzzle, or ""phase"". priority is everything and their priority is in franchising, not making ""a"" good movie. but stringing along as many as possible, for the unforeseeable future.

there's no real authenticity to the stories being told. james gunn is the last real director to work with marvel, and maybe the only one. I love sam raimi but holy fuck was doctor strange 2 just so... hollow. Edgar Wright's antman could've been something special, but they didn't see eye to eye with how the greater universe would be handled in his movie. so that was never going to happen. there have been a few good directors so I'm not being 100% literal here, but the point I'm obviously making is the quality of their contribution only suffers by being a product of the biggest commercial endeavor of the 21st century. 

this movie was great however. james gunn doesn't miss",2023-09-19

"I can't see that in any capacity, she died and joined Heimdall in the afterlife. As far as we know, the newest big bad is a big time travel guy. No real rhyme or reason to shoehorn a return.

Jane does have a character arc, but it's literally just ""I'm dying"". It doesn't tie to the villain in any significant way. Heck, it doesn't even tie to her become the new Thor in any way. She doesn't really develop any more than Thor does in looking for his purpose after everything that's happened. With Thor, the movie can be looked at more as an epilogue, with him becoming a father to an even greater hero and being a god that showed kindness to the God-butcher where no other God would.

Jane's clearly the hook that was supposed to get people into the movie, I'll agree with that. However, her appearance doesn't counteract the fact that Thor is significantly dumbed down in the movie, even if it's because he no longer had a purpose to serve.

"Yeah, after the way the MCU took so many legitimate relics and items of powers and just combined them with infinity gems I‚Äôve often speculated on what items of power could be adapted or repurposed to fill in for others and maintain continuity as new characters and scenarios arise. For example, after the space stone/tesseract I‚Äôve often wondered if they could ever include a real cosmic cube in all of its omnipotent reality warping glory. 
As for Adam I wonder what could even be used as a substitute? Could it possibly be explained as a piece of the M‚Äôkraan crystal? Maybe the Ka Stone, or a Norn Stone? Crimson Gem, a fragment of the heart of the universe with limited power? Or maybe something more similar to an actual cosmic cube, or a cosmically imbued object like the cosmic control rod of annihillus, or even something more simple like the solar gem that powers Vision in the comics.
It could even be something new, a small crystalline matrix that functions like a battery with the ability to store limitless energy. Tie it in to the Universal Church of Truth, make it absorb and utilize faith energy from any and all who believe in Adam. It then converts the faith energy(like the belief fonts in the templeships and the armor used hy the priests) into a form of energy that can be absorbed and utilized by Adams body to greatly enhance his already formidable abilities as well as grant new ones such as his ability to wield quantum sorcery. This could even lead an internal and external conflict. Adams power grows and so does the church‚Äôs following and power. The church seeks to use Adam and the growing faith and power for questionable purposes. Adam becomes conflicted, he mistrusts the church but enjoys the power, his quantum abilities continue to grow. Eventually his inner turmoil and conflict combined with his staggering power in quantum magic causes a split, separating Adam into quantum possibilities of himself existing in a sort of superposition: The golden, shining Adam Warlock known to all, and the new and dark, power hungry Magus.",2023-05-08

"Yeah I'm at 2>1>3 at the moment but only because 3 was much darker than I expected and feels much harder to rewatch. It's still really well done, I think I went in feeling sad knowing it would be the last one anyway and then the movie just kept getting sadder. I also didn't have any standout songs in 3. Soundtracks for 1 and 2 were much better to me. Good ending though, I think my biggest mistake was seeing it a week late. It was still a pretty full theater but opening night crowds are always gonna be a better experience. Less laughter at the sort-of-funny things just lets the dark stuff loom more.

With 2 I like that they split up into 2 groups and then even further broke down to pairs (minus Groot) where everyone is challenged and forced to reflect/grow. Really solid character study stuff.

I understand people getting upset about the new characterization of Drax in 2 but with Gamora and Nebula's stoic and glum attitudes, Drax's goofiness is honestly a nice change of pace, even if it's out of left field. I feel like Mantis kept that grounded with her read of him.

Other than that, people complain about jokes undercutting serious moments, which I agree was a big issue that took me out of the moment a few times. But I was still able to feel the important emotional beats, and the missed ones don't sour the whole thing for me.

"It's also my favorite of the three, though all are excellent.

I like that it does the ""Add more characters and split up the cast that had great chemistry"" and actually uses it to the movie's advantage. From a structural standpoint, I appreciate that it's able to take advantage of the well-developed character relationships from the first movie and cut them down to still-intelligible shorthand, while taking a character that had clear but reductive development in the first movie and making him more prominent (Yandu), and using the ""savings"" from leaning on the first movie to not make the new characters seem like afterthoughts.

Also, the ""Mr. Blue Sky"" scene that opens the movie stands as the most inventive and delightful action set piece the MCU ever had, and the ""Come a Little Bit Closer"" sequence with Yondu, Rocket, and Root is the best distillation of the cheerfully fucked up *GotG* sensibility in any of movies.",2023-06-15

You can really see the weight of that on Affleck's face in that moment and I think it's an incredible character defining moment for his version of Batman.

"I think the resolution of vol 3 really highlights how each character has a very clear character development arc from start to end, some more pronounced than others.

Weirdly enough, all 3 guardian movies balance the jokes and serious tones very well personally, I think vol 2 was the most shakey with this balance but 3 kept it very well balanced.

And I agree! Biggest disappointment for me was the music. After radio head creep cover played, I wasn't hooked on any of the songs that came after. That conversation between Drax, mantis and nebula solidified the issues I might have had with overly goofy Drax. Groot's arc probably went in reversed with senior groot first then new baby groot. I'm okay with groot not getting much characterization. He's always just been a solid root of the guardians family.

Vol 1 was a simply story that established the characters really well, Vol 2 gave each of them proper development and nuance to each character, vol 3 caps their arc nicely with a satisfying ending for all of them. I think Vol 2 is high for me because i just enjoyed the movie that much both with the laughs and emotions. This is probably the best trilogy for me in the MCU.",2023-05-17

A lot of creative people simply have poor skills/knowledge of various fields of science, and it shows in their writing. It's not just MCU movies, and it's not just movies either. Lots of scifi books and movies have this problem, where the author chooses to incorporate ideas concerning some field of science, fails to research and understand the particular field deep enough, so they fail to comprehend how the idea they have come up with is a dumb idea, and an idea that the actually competent character would understand to be a dumb idea.

It's not just mathematics or biology either. Military science is a big one as well in which lots of writers fail to educate themselves well enough to write plausible combat scenes. Or martial arts, lots of writers have no idea about how sword combat works in reality, but they write sword fighting scenes nonetheless, making HEMA practicioners roll their eyes.

Thanos is a highly intelligent and resourceful being, highly competent in engineering and biology.

This is correct, of course, you're right that it's deeper than ""mommy name same?! friend!"".

But.

*But*.

The event that gets Bats to realise this *is still what we all heard in the cinema* which is the utterance of ""Martha"" and it's absolutely an unnatural thing for someone to say in that moment.

The performances weren't bad, the writing of it was just really tacky and just badly pulled off. There probably could've been a bunch of better, more emotionally resonate ways of going for what they did, but they went a choice that felt very out of place and at a surface level can be taken out of context in a way that looks dumb ""oh so NOW he saved her because their mothers have the sane name? How random""

The idea they had was great, Bruce realizing Superman is just another person like him and not a monster to fear, mother and all, and him connecting to clark that way to get past his xenophobia is a really good idea, but it just wasn't done properly. 

It was a movie that had great ideas but just constantly with the bad choice for its execution. The minute the movie started and Batman was killing people with a gun was when I realized Snyder genuinely doesnt understand these characters. I get they wanted a Batman who has somewhat lost his way but this was beyond that. Same with Lex, that was absolutely the WORST possible direction they could've went with that character. Lex is an giant arrogant bastard who is a perfectionist and considers himself to be the best in both ohysical shape and intelligence, and Superman simply existing to challenge that is what drives Lex to the villiany we know him for, and even then he's still a very cool and collected individual. A bizarre and socially inept Zuckerburg knock off is fucking beyond stupid. It's equally as bad as the version of DOOM (my favorite marvel character) in F4ntastic. 

Snyder is someone who either needs source material already written (300, Watchmen) to direct or just do something wholly original that's not an adaptation. I really enjoyed Suckerpunch too btw, but that film even had its issues.

I don't hate Snyder, he's one of my favorite directors behind the camera but he needs someone to really reel him in with his ideas. He's like Vince McMahon with wrestling; with a good team to say no to weird ideas and filter what he's going for he's great but on his own creatively its usually a giant mess with bizarre decisions. 

I'll give credit where it's due though, Watchmen is my favorite book of all time and I was fine with his decision to cut the squid from the film. Having to explain that in the film the way the book does would've required an entire hour added to the film, the ending he went with still has the same meaning and effect on the universe of the story, just the how is slightly altered. That being said I don't think he realized that we're not supposed to think Rorschach is a ""cool badass"" when he's a homeless psychotic bigot right wing extremist (something I think the HBO show understood a lot better), but it was still very well done.

-	Some of these writers are Harvard Graduates (The Simpsons), or Veterans (Oliver Stone), or whatever else. I can promise you none of them are ""incapable of understanding"" .

-	So I guess from both cultural perspectives, I want to say you might be stupid as fuck, cause you dont even realize how ignorant you are.

Thanos didnt care about logical means, because he only cared about his genocidal ends.

This story was a power play between moral factors, and you tried to dismiss that as ""writers being too stupid to understand that people grow back.""

And their inclusion was so muted that it had no impact unlike basically every track in Guardians 1.

One example I like to use is Amazing Spider-man 2. On release day, threads were filled with people loving the movie. Loving how much more like the comic books that movie felt. Praising performances. Etc.

Then not more than a week later and everybody hated it. It's very clear when the internet repeats something, that opinion propogates throughout the population, often to the point that it becomes wrong to disagree with it. It's peer pressure through and through. It's subconscious.

Your reasoning completely fizzles in the context of both the movie and the song, you're just blindly going with it.  It isn't even close to the same level of musical inclusion as Guardians (Especially) 1 and 2, and was just haphazardly included because it said ""space"" like a Suicide Squad 2016 song.
