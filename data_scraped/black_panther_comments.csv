Namor casually giving Shuri a water suit of someone he probably killed painfully and removed their body from was pretty morbidly funny,2022-11-11 11:05:38
"I was a bit confused, when Okoye was fighting Namors soldiers on the street she stabbed them with mortal wounds and they healed instantly, but when Nakia shot them rescuing Shuri they died and couldn’t heal. What’s the deal?",2022-11-11 07:40:26
"The Ironheart suit looked too much like Baymax. I hope they give her a suit that looks like the comics in the show. 

The Midnight Angel suits made me think of Rowlet (the pokemon) and once I saw it I couldn't unsee it. Their design could've been better. 

I would've liked to see Shurri in action as Black Panther more. The final battle felt kind of rushed. 

The Ross and Elaine stuff felt shoehorned in to set up Thunderbolts. They could have cut that stuff and saved it for the TB movie. 

And minor gripe, but it did feel kinda weird that none of the other Avengers were there for T'Challa's funeral. I get the logistics of why they weren't in the movie but just having Bucky, Sam, Pepper, etc off to the side wearing white for the procession would have been nice. 

On the positive side Namor looked cool as hell and I'm impressed they pulled off his wings/flying without it looking super goofy. Talokan looked super cool too. And I dug how it parralled Wakanda. The acting was also really great. 

And ""Oh shit she has an Ironman suit"" is my new official favorite piece of dialog from an MCU movie",2022-11-11 22:05:35
"This movie is another example of when serving the greater universe interrupts the current movie. Riri is a plot device, that was evidently inserted because she'll be getting a Disney plus show. Fine, but the story surrounding her character....why is Namor trying to kill her when the CIA already has her machine? Are they really implying that the CIA wouldn't record the work she did? It doesn't matter if u kill her when the technology is already out there lol. Also why is she still JUST in school when she's basically made the most important invention in modern history? Lol",2022-11-13 02:22:55

Idk why but I was siding with Namor and his people.",2022-11-11 10:52:05
The amount of time that the production team spent on Okoye's suit was the same amount of time it took Shuri and Riri to find Namor's weakness.,2022-11-11 18:22:29
"My biggest gripe with the movie that’s not being mentioned here is how this completely does away with what we walked away from in Black Panther 1. Killmonger was the eye opener to how shitty it was of Wakanda to close its borders and turn their back on the world. While blacks were first slaves then eventually treated like 2nd hand citizens, Wakanda did nothing, and Killmonger came for revenge. Well fricken T’Challa recognized this BS from the elders in the ancestral plane, slap their bitch-asses and said No More. His whole character growth in that movie was realizing that his cousin wasn’t exactly wrong in his thinking but that he was wrong in his execution. 

But nah Black Panther 2 is like fuck that, fuck humans, fuck France for some reason and fuck the world, we’re just gonna forget that ever happened and share nothing with y’all. What an awesome way to honor T’Challas passing by just forgetting what he stood for. Just ignoring it entirely actually in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

Namor was badass though. Needed him for like 45m instead of the 10 we got with him.",2022-11-14 07:14:26

"So my take away was Wakanda can't defend themselves, Thier Queen,Princess AND protect their borders...WHILE patrolling ON the water AFTER being informed their new enemy lives under the sea.

"I enjoyed it but I think it still fell short or expectations.  They did a good job all things considered.  I definitely got teary eyed a few times, Angela Bassett was fantastic.

+The intro was very well done, first 15 minutes were super promising imo.

+Riri didn’t fall as flat as America Chavez, helps that we know we’re getting a show with her though.

+My fav scene was easily Ramonda stripping Okoye of her title, easily the best acting we’ve seen in the MCU imo

-I think it was too long, I really liked Namor’s backstory but feel like where his story ended didn’t warrant as much time as we did spend with him.

-VFX was not great at times, the use of Volume was easy to spot towards the third act.",2022-11-12 23:51:39

"So assuming he was unchallenged, does M'Baku just become king of Wakanda now? Are they gonna let two people run around with Black Panther powers?",2022-11-11 03:16:52
"For all people complain about MCU films being too formulaic or generic, phase 4 has been heavily driven by director vision and style.

The film was, as I'm sure everyone will point out, too long.  The CIA plot was unnecessary and only saved by the charisma of the actors.  And it did somewhat function as a breathing moment between the other events.  The most egregiously unnecessary bit was the prolonged car chase scene with domestic police that ends with several cop cars destroyed, an international incident, and a completely deserted bridge somewhere near Boston.  It made no sense and they did the car chase thing in the first movie.

Chadwick's death was handled well.  It doesn't particularly matter, but I felt like they should have gotten the ""he's sick"" concept out faster.  

Ironheart's inclusion felt quite shoehorned.  Riri's characterization never really solidified either.  

Angela Bassett is absolutely amazing in this movie.  She and Danai Gurira carry the first two thirds of the film, which is why their characters' removal from the primary focus in the final third weakens things so much.  

This film's first issue is that it starts off asking the viewer to care very much about an, arguably, minor interest side character from the first film.  And it makes that character rigid and unlikable through the whole of the film. Shuri doesn't believe in the spirit realm despite her entire family line having seen it first hand.  Not to mention the whole space magician vanishing half the universe's population thing.  

This problem of unlikable main character is worsened by the fact that the ""villain"" is charismatic and mostly justified in his actions.  *Mostly*, Namor's choice to attack civilians and then assassinate a queen makes zero fucking sense.  He flips from ""protecting our people is important"" to ""I'll murder your civilians and assassinate your queen."" Which brings me to what I think the core problem is with this movie.  

All of these people are terrible leaders of insanely powerful nation states.  Well, powerful if not for their crippling stupidity.  The broad bones of this story, Namor and the Wakandans, is a political one.  About how another rival nation with access to vibranium reacts to knowledge of the mineral spreading.  About the transfer of power from a strong leader to a novice.  About how militant advisors can goad a leader into irrational responses.  Unfortunately, that's not the story Coogler was remotely interested in telling. He wanted to focus on the family drama and grief and all that, which is fine, except it's like putting an ill fitted human meat suit over the skeleton of an orangutan.  It works, but its also bizarrely uneven.

On the whole, I liked it but it was rather dull, certainly not fun.  Not interested in seeing more of Shuri as Black Panther. Or Wakanda in general, for that matter.",2022-11-14 15:47:05

"After 2 viewings and some time to mull over this one, I think this film is a mixed bag. It does a great job of paying tribute to Chadwick, and I think Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are phenomenal. Namor is a great villain and I can't wait to see (na)more. So happy they didn't force in a billion unfunny jokes every second, and I actually appreciate the length after LaT and MoM suffered from their runtimes. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, a lot of things didn't work for me as well. Ironheart is very shoehorned and imo she isn't a great character, and I feel she was taking attention from characters like M'Baku and Nakia that I felt were underused. As per usual of the modern day MCU, there was some wonky CGI. The final act is straight up bad and one of the worst MCU final battles, and the resolution to the Talokan/Wakanda conflict wasn't good imo. The editing was really off on this one, so many scenes felt cut short, and the editing in the action specifically wasn't good.

I'm confused, why did Namora attack them on the bridge in Boston? Namor told Wakanda to get Riri back to them so as far as he was aware thats what they were doing. Why expose your secret underwater society to where there's a ton of possible witnesses around to grab her? If the plan was to kill her anyway why even involve Wakanda? 


Also was it just me or was the third act fight a bit messy? Shuri full on gets stabbed and kind of just walks it off? Like I know that flower is supposed to make you strong but didn't Killmonger die in a similar way? 


Also was it implied Namor was of partial Spanish descent? Judging by the facial hair and accent? I remember reading some leak a while back that seemed to line up a lot with this plot.",2022-11-11 08:02:44
"This movie was at its best when dealing with the grieving of T’Challa’s death and how the country and those closest to him move forward. I feel like the Talokan conflict would’ve worked better with T’Challa, as initially planned, with he and Namor confronting each other as equals. Instead you have Shuri, who isn’t fully cooked and hasn’t yet come to terms with her brother’s death. That said, Letitia Wright is great, Angela Bassett is phenomenal.

Riri and Ross (and Contessa by extension) feel really tacked on to the movie, like just to remind you to watch Ironheart and Thunderbolts.

I don’t think anyone was expecting T’Challa and Nakia having a son. My theater was silent when Shuri was grieving then to a gasp when Nakia showed up with a child. That’s when everyone knew.,2022-11-11 03:18:32

"Marvel is so blatantly lazy when it comes to power/technology. Wakanda was introduced as this bastion of technology, hundreds of years ahead of anyone else on earth. Yet somehow with every new movie where we get a glimpse of Wakanda it seems like they're... regressing?

Against another civilization that also only fights with sticks, animals, and water balloons. The...

"Surprised they didn't have any cameos for the funeral and I thought the ship beaming up the coffin clashed with the overall aesthetic of the funeral. As well as how cheap looking the coffins looked in an otherwise well done scene. 

The film was about 30 minutes too long and not enough Namor but split into halves. 2nd half with the suits and the finale, I completely lost interest in besides Namors scenes. 

I also really disliked Riri, she wasn't funny or interesting after the the scene in her room and completely took me out of it. The scene at the end with car just felt like product placement.

Also don't understand how Shuri was still alive after being impaled and then suddenly on a ship as if nothing happened.

Loved some of the cinematography especially when Namor descends onto his throne as well as some of the music, I thought it was funny to include a Spanish song during the Talocan scene considering his history.",2022-11-13 01:11:12
"It felt like such a juxtaposition between things that looked and/or sounded really cool, and just incredibly stupid moments and massive plot holes. 

The imagery from the funeral, the underwater world, stuff like that was awesome.

*""Yes, sir, I do. It's about a group of indigenous tribespeople with blue skin that we've never seen before because they all live in the ocean, and they're angry because some other people are trying to take their natural resource, which is a special kind of metal unlike anything on Earth, so they're going to fight each other and there will be a lot of really cool water effects.""*

"The movie was fun and I really enjoyed the visual design of everything. Namor was shockingly powerful, and his nation earned their threat.

That said, I thought the third act fight was a mess. Too many CGI characters that didn’t feel solid all on an overly simple set that seemed like poor planning from a story perspective. It seems like a shame considering how good the action scenes were in the first two acts. 

Oh, and every time M’Baku spoke was the best.",2022-11-11 03:24:02

I like how they were cool with killing the American scientist until they saw it was a black chick lol,2022-11-17 02:44:33
"I am happy that other people liked it, but I did not like this. I would give it a 4.5/10.

What I Liked

* Queen Romonda scenes are pretty good. She is honestly the only character I genuinely liked for the whole movie.  Though I guess I liked Nakia a lot too. 
* Killmonger cameo, interesting character so it was good to see him used again, but in a way he just highlighted how lacking other characters are. 
* Namor has some cool aspects, most notably seeing how strong he is.    
* I like Mesoamerican history so that stuff was cool to me. 

Did Not Like  

* Suri is the true weak link of the movie for me. At best she is extremely boring, at worst she is annoying towards the end. And Letitia Write just does a bad job acting in most of the ""important"" scenes.    
* The end of the movie, with Suri becoming Black Panther and the final battle, just feels really rushed. 
* Outside of the initial funeral shots in the beginning, none of the serious scenes about T'Challa passing connected with me at all or made me feel anything.    
* It is too long. There are huge chunks that are just boring. There is no other way to say it.    
* I didn't find any of the action scenes to be that exceptional or memorable.   
* Namor is pretty cool, but what he is trying to do is so ridiculous it ruins the character for most of the movie.    
* The central conflict, what to do with Riri, could easily have been handled in a very easy way that no character seems to even consider. I will admit this is a nitpick.    
* None of the scenes with Everett Ross and Fontaine add anything to the movie. Their scenes slow everything down.  And honestly the movie would have benefited from all their scenes being cut. 
* A lot of it is just too dark visually.  Though this might just be a problem with my theater cause it sucks.  
* Ironheart looks like a cheap cartoon in action scenes.
* If getting to Riri was the so important why only send one person and the princess? Again, this is a minor nitpick. 

Questions

* When Ironheart is making her suit in Wakanda they make sure to show her welding and hammering out the heart. Do you see that heart shape cutout on the final suit? I feel like I didn't notice it.
* Why couldn’t they just explain the situation to Riri and tell her to  destroy her research on her machine and not to make another one? Why did they act like killing her or making her live in Wakanda were the only options?",2022-11-12 19:39:38
Angela Bassett acted her ass off in here. There have been some stellar actors/performances in the MCU but I've never felt someone more deserving of an Oscar nod than I have after seeing her in this movie. The emotion that she bring and the command she has over every scene she's is was so captivating. The scene where she fires okoye..... holy damn. She was hands down the best part of this movie for me.,2022-11-11 03:37:37
"Man what a disappointment. The film has some good moments but it's drawn out with way too much filler and a lot of the connective tissue isn't all that engaging with some shaky internal logic.

The Good

* The Chadwick tribute is emotional and understated
* Strong performances all around from the cast
* Interesting themes of loss and grief
* The>! Michael B Jordan!< cameo

The Bad

* Film's internal logic is all over the place. A lot of character decisions only happen because they're necessary to move the plot forward
* Way too bloated with filler content. The Everett Ross subplot is dull and pointless.
* Both Riri and Lupita Nyongo don't really have anything to do. Riri is essentially a McGuffin that Namor then immediately disregards when decides to go all invasion-y.
* Despite a soldi performance from Tenoch Huerta, Namor and the Talokan still feel a bit underdeveloped and his 180 from wanting to be secret to going to war with the surface feels a bit out of left field
* Action scenes are generally underwhelming

The Weird

* Shuri tells her mom that AIs going rogue and attempting to kill us all ""is just in the movies"" despite living in a reality where there was a very public case of that exact same thing happening (Ultron)",2022-11-11 08:30:50
"The critics I follow made it seem like I'd be sobbing the whole movie, and that really was not the case.",2022-11-11 04:50:11

"Does anyone know when production was? 2021? 

I had watched the first BP the day before, and this one just felt like it was made in a pandemic. Clear sets. Clear green screen (or the led wall). Clear cgi third act. But then even the cinematography felt different - it felt mostly handheld with singular shots. Not as much diversity as the first film, which surprised me since it’s Coogler returning. 

Did anyone else pick up on it? I need to watch it again. I had to get up a few times in the beginning, so maybe that affected my watch.",2022-11-11 16:05:34

It wasn't super interesting and was far too long for its own good.",2022-11-13 01:01:27
I'm really glad they kept it as serious as they did. Too much comedy would have undercut the movie.,2022-11-11 07:04:44
"Can anyone clarify this plot point for me, or is it truly just a gaping plot hole like I think it is?

How tf did this conflict initially start? Namor told Ramonda and Shuri to capture the scientist, bring her to Wakanda, and blow the conch shell to turn her over.

Shuri and Okoye captured the scientist and were in the process of bringing her to Wakanda when Namor’s people *attacked them with explosives*. At this point, he had no reason to believe they were going to defy him, so his people basically almost killed the princess of the nation he supposedly wants to ally with for no reason? 

Further, he essentially kidnaps the princess and holds her captive, and then… what? Declares war because Wakanda had the audacity to take their kidnapped princess back? Because two servants were killed in the process?

This dude is supposed to be 600 years old and still he’s behaving like an impulsive mortal hothead like Killmonger, but dumber. I would’ve expected something a little more than “yeah we attacked/stole their princess and they took her back” to trigger war between two world superpowers.",2022-11-11 20:58:05

Hell even a large chunk of Spider-Man we’ve seen so far is in a robotic suit. Just very samey to me. 

Enjoyed it as much as Thor 4 (another where the villain character is the most interesting) and less than Dr Strange 2. 

I did like the small hints that M’Baku is Man-Ape in the comics. The chest pounding, the hooting. The different tribes in Wakanda being distinguishable is great design and I like his/theirs the best.",2022-11-11 06:52:38

But man you could FEEEL Tchalla and the Black Panther missing from this movie I couldn’t stop thinking how amazing the story would’ve been if he was here with the parallels Namors story and the fight between them honestly could’ve seen this being a top 5 Marvel movie 

Namor was so fucking cool might be a bit biased as a Mexican but I couldn’t get enough of him and his story, wish we saw the headdress more and a bit more of his world but I hope to see him again soon because everything about him was so sick

The Ironheart plot was the most Forced part of the movie it felt so out of place sometimes I didn’t care for riri at all and the suit was TERRRRRIBLE

The C-plot was so remotely related to the rest of the movie and could've been cut without affecting anything.

Wth this was really well shot for a marvel movie. I mean there was little to no cuts during the dialogue scenes which I always appreciate.

Also, are we going to pretend that Yuri wasn't mortally wounded at the end? As such, I didn't like how Namor conceded that the Black Panther was the strongest person on Earth. He clearly is.

Overall it was entertaining. I just feel like we're back to where we ended with the last film where we are just waiting for Killmonger (now Namor's) fears of the outside world to finally be properly addressed by the main characters. All this stuff about nobility is too idealistic and there needs to be consequences for the characters.",2022-11-18 06:15:41

Would have been cool if the avengers were there for king tchalla funeral. I wonder how avengers are gonna address his death,2022-11-12 02:30:54
"I'm sorry but I was fully ready to come in and cry my eyes out and, though some tears were shed, I just found the movie kind of boring.  I think it was a gigantic mistake to introduce something as fanciful as those sea-people and Namor in the same movie where we're trying to real-life process Boseman/T'Challa's unexpected deaths.  I felt like I wasn't allowed to have *any* fun.  The guy died and it was tragic but, I dunno, maybe after an hour we should get to have *some* fun, right?  Especially in a movie with blue people and a dude with wings on his heels?

Even Endgame started out depressing but after the first 40 or so minutes, it got fun and gave us some relief.  Here, the relief never came and there’s a dude with wings on his feet flying around while his blue people threw water bombs.  The movie should have shifted tones or there should have been a more realistic villain.  

Not to mention the pacing was choppy as hell.  Scenes just began and ended, with no real flow between them, linking them.  The last scene was really beautiful but it was the same tone as the rest of the movie.  I wish it could have been more cathartic, with more energy.  Maybe even have her laughing and smiling, so we can see that she'll be okay.  Something to make us feel like it was the end of a journey.  

The music selection was strong though, as they usually are with Coogler movies.  

Shuri is a great character but I still felt like she needed more character development to round her out as a person.  I wish she was with her mom more during the beginning, learning from her and giving us insight into what she’s thinking.  As it is, I have no idea who she is, what her motivations are, her long term goals.  I liked her in the first movie because she was a genius and seemed super playful, which was enough for a side character, but we barely got any of that here.  I get that she’s grieving her brother but is her entire character just based off her relationship with this one person?  The movie dropped the ball establishing her as an individual.
 
I also could have used more character development on the new Iron-girl.  She seemed really cool but like, what in her life made her feel the need to make a suit like that?  I can assume, sure, but tell us!  I want to get to know these people!  Makes it easier to cheer them on later.  Overall it was supposed to be their movie but I felt like I barely knew any of them by the end.  

Bassett, N'yongo (a goddess on Earth), and Gurira were great and they had some good scenes.  Not many complaints there though I wish Shuri were with them more for her much-needed character development. 

The Boseman/T'Challa tribute in the beginning was beautiful.  Honestly, his death was handled very respectfully, I thought.

I just wish I liked this more.  It feels like the ingredients were there but it was too long and way too dour.  I came ready to have a huge emotional experience but, after a few tears in the beginning, I was like ""Okay, lets get this going"" and then it never quite took off.  It just stayed the same sad tone throughout, which gets boring after awhile.  I don’t mind long movies and I don’t mind melancholy movies, but when you do both it adds up and feels like double the running time.  This is all my opinion, of course.",2022-11-11 03:14:06
"Don’t really have to much to say as it is hard to ignore him just being gone. The tribute to him in the beginning was great.

Dr Doom appearance!<",2022-11-11 03:09:37
"After watching it a grand total of one time (So far) I honestly felt mostly underwhelmed. I mean, it's not all bad and it handled most things well but man it felt aggressively average at best. Anyway, I made a few points and I'll try to be kind of constructive:

The good

- They handled Chadwick's passing very tastefully and it never felt too in your face.

- The performances were great for the most part, especially Angela Bassett.

- Namor turned out great and we'll be seeing him quite a bit going forward.

The bad

- Marvel are clearly gearing up for Thunderbolts/Ironheart/whatever-the-hell and it was so obvious it was distracting

- The CIA storyline was completely unneeded and could have been replaced with more Talocan/Namor development or something

- Riri Williams probably didn't need to be in it that much. She really should been semi-developed before this. 

- The CGI still looks ass in some scenes which blows my mind. It's 2022 ffs. 

- The entire 3rd act felt like a generic Marvel thing that they do now.",2022-11-11 13:22:32
"Liked the movie, but as someone mentioned, I was puzzled when Shuri got ""speared"" by Namor.

That was awful,2022-11-21 06:18:23
"There are vestiges of a good film in here, and I understand it was a difficult situation for everyone involved, but what a disappointment.

The pacing and tone were all over the place (though not in the usual Marvel bathos style), and it felt like multiple movies stitched together at times. I was honestly shocked that the runtime was only 2:41 - it felt longer than Zack Snyder's Justice League.

I saw this in IMAX 3D, and unfortunately I can't recommend it - various reviews have noted that the film is poorly lit, and 3D glasses make this even worse.

The prologue and epilogue were touching tributes to Boseman, at least.",2022-11-11 03:08:50
They failed to serve us more Wakanda in this film. I wanted to feel more immersed in the culture and see more of the city. The challenge waterfall set gave us that in the first film and we returned there a bit but they should have given us different Wakandan sets and culture. We should come away feeling like we know Wakanda well now after the second film and I don’t think we know it anymore than we already did. There’s a whole city. Give us a Wakandan sports  scene. Something light and fun the whole film relied on grief and emotion that was caused by flip flopping motives and ideas on Namors part.,2022-11-15 01:09:02

So in the scene when Namor is telling Shuri he wants to go to war with the world why didn’t she just tell him “oh uh multiple aliens and dimensional beings have tried that. You don’t want to go there”? Maybe just show him the avengers movies?,2023-02-03 04:18:36

"What exactly was Namor’s battle plan for fighting a land war on terrain actively hostile to his people?

Like his people didn’t have guns or even tanks (I guess they did have some sort of water transport used at the bridge, but never used it after lol)- they rode of the backs of whales. He and his Jordan 90s were their entire Air Force. And when we got to not-Atlantis I expected to see all sorts of cool tech- but nope literally children playing with the underwater version of a hoop and stick.

I have sincere doubts about their supposed military prowess and strategy.",2022-11-13 00:37:17
"Having Shuri feel alone and finding Killmonger as her source of guidance for how to live in the world without her family instead of just having her see her parents was such a fun direction. It really left me disasappointed though by the end of the movie, it felt like Marvel was teasing that they know how to take their characters in interesting directions and have them struggle with conflict requiring growth to become a true hero, but in the end we inevitably get the main character instantly doing what's right after being in a mindset of doing what feels right.

I know there are a number of reasons why Marvel wouldn't want to go this route, but imagine if they had Shuri kill Namor and the next movie featured Shuri still doing good deeds as Black Panther, but also with growing animosity towards the UN and having her attempt to consolidate her power after M'Baku and the Jabari people return to being more isolationist and separated from the rest of Wakanda. Movie could display her as a conflicted hero who then goes on a journey to realize that she's doing some good deeds but ultimately is not being the hero the Black Panther should be, nor fulfilling her brother's wish of Wakanda playing a more benevolent role in global affairs.

Never thought they would dare end the movie with Shuri not being a perfect hero due to the previously unnamed reasons (bad PR for the Black Panther to not be anything but a hero leaving the movie, possible production issues with how Black Panther would have to tie into the rest of the MCU and how stand alone movies would play into that, etc.) but still disappointed because for a short window of time Marvel showed a window where they coulda come out and said ""in *Black Adam* they use the term anti-hero a lot without ever really establishing much of one, THIS is how ya do it"" and mic-dropped on DC's latest mediocre effort.",2022-11-11 03:13:09
"Really run of the mill Marvel film, quite boring, the Wakandans are wholly unlikable.

My theater was packed with people clapping, screaming whenever the Dora Milaje moved 2 inches, whatever. It's a Marvel film so wasn't bothered.

It was boring though, Letitia has none of the charisma Chadwick brought to the table. Everything is so formulaic - Martin Freeman is running through the woods, lemme guess some Wakandans are going to materialize, wow they did, audience hollers, repeat with him in a van at the end of the film.

Character reveals are barely barely earned, am I supposed to jaw drop when Ironheart shows up? I don't know this character, I don't care, suit design is shite. Midnight Angel - ok let's just say the name and throw them into the next scene.

College kids just make Iron Man suits like it's nothing now? Did I miss something?
They've been dialing up the young adult fiction tropes in recent releases.

No consequences - Wakandans didn't kill the NAVY SEAL CIA vibranium miners, they would never - 10 minutes later kill like 10 cops in Boston trying to stop them from... kidnapping a college student.

The final fight scene between panther and Namor was akin to the scene in Taken where there's 30 jump cuts to have him jump over the fence, audience was audibly puzzled.

"I thought it was good, but not great. The mourning over T'Challa's death is handled very well, and forms the emotional core of the movie.

Lots of other stuff doesn't work nearly as well.

I was very underwhelmed by the scene where we finally see Talokan - it seemed like there were barely any people there, and I didn't see as much of the imaginative potential in such a society as I would have liked. If Wakanda is afro-futurism in an uncolonized African city-state, then I would have liked Talocan to offer something similar for indigenous central Americans, but it seems so beholden to a Mayan aesthetic that it wasn't able to really create the sense of a living thriving society with its own relationship to tradition and ""modernity"" like Wakanda.

We barely learned anything about Talocan's culture or its people.

Namor also doesn't work as well as Killmonger. Killmonger is reacting to the injustices of contemporary America. Namor apparently saw the horrors of colonial Spanish America and destroyed one hacienda and called it a day until 400 years later when he decides that the surface finally poses a threat and needs to be conquered?

Unfortunately, the nature of the ""hidden country"" aspect of the story necessitates Namor putting his revenge on hold until his sudden reappearance. He'll ""never forget"" Spanish colonialism, but he let it play out more or less how it played out in our world, presumably. WWII came and went, but it was America almost discovering them that sets the events of the story into action.

(Eternals had a similar issue with the mind-controlling hero. He apparently decided to give up after one peacefully integrated village, and give people their free will everywhere else for... reasons?)

I'm a little unclear on why Namor gives the Wakandans a week to regroup? They're the main obstacle between him and control of the surface, and his initial small strike force seemed to have been devastatingly effective. If he had just kept going, he could have won and wiped out the only serious threat to his taking power (except perhaps the Avengers.)",2022-11-15 09:44:59
Okay these enemies crushed us on our own home turf and are dominant in water. Let's fight them on a big BOAT. That'll work for sure,2022-11-19 09:07:09
This movie was a mess. Namor and his tribe was the highlight. Marvel needs to step back and figure their shit out. The CGI costumes suck ass. They’re just so shit man.,2022-11-30 07:05:18
"God, this movie could have been such a masterpiece but it's TERRIBLE. The concept of the film is great! The sister of the Black Panther struggles with grief and the loss of her brother/failure to save him. Meanwhile, she is the one who can make two countries go to war or have an allience. And this all with Wakanda and Talokan as a backdrop, 2 countries with amazing rich cultures and peoples. Great pitch. 


Let's write a shit script as the cherry on top.


This is what I call a 3 hour recap movie. It's just things happening on a screen. No weight to the choices made by the characters, development is meaningless because the stakes haven't been properly established and at no point does the movie actually try to pull you into a story arc. It's just bullet points on a list. Just going through the motions. 
Wakanda seems like such an amazing place and they don't explore it at all. It's all about the vibranium. 
These things don't make a film bad (they don't make a film good) but it makes this film terrible because it could have been something great. 

Also, what did Martin Short even do? No hate on him but why was he even in the movie?



Pros: M'Baku, every scene with him in it is an exception to the things I've said above because his character is just awesome and he's played very well. Love the little scene where he ""tests"" the new Black Panther.

The scene where Namor actually pleads for cooperation is a good moment. I was kinda thinking it was gonna be an alliance by marriage at some point but that didn't go through. Don't know if that would be better or worse than what happened in the movie tho.",2022-12-04 01:05:46

I feel like they didn’t go in even more into Namor peoples lives/culture because it would just remind us of the new Avatar coming.,2022-11-11 05:18:17
Felt absolutely no hype when shuri wore the suit. It's supposed to be a great moment where the Black Panther returns but it's just fell flat. Same with iron heart.,2022-11-11 13:29:30
"I didn’t necessarily understand the main plot. The Taloken were shown to be invincible in the beginning of the movie, so what exactly were they concerned about regarding people finding vibranium? And why did they initially need Wakanda’s help? Some cool shots and concepts, but I just kept thinking Avatar is going to look much better underwater.",2022-11-11 03:17:12
"Why was the majority of the film captured in  medium shots and completely out of focus backgrounds? It really screamed mid tier camera work despite the nice production design. 

And did they really give a teenager a super suit to shoot at the water people? Now she can go back to class as a stone cold killer lmao",2022-11-15 04:12:54

"well that was terrible. the cgi was really bad, especially at that final fight scene. Okoye and Riri looked like floating heads and the suits looked terrible, no idea why they would give Okoye that suit when her old battlewear and weapon were so much better. movie was way too long, the CIA subplot was kinda dumb. i thought this would be a more emotional film about BP given the trailers, but it just quickly devolved into standard marvel shit after that intro

really disappointing film, marvel really got me again with the trailers",2022-11-22 16:28:52

"The whole thing was just pretty poorly shot.

Not that MCU films are usually masterpieces of cinematography or anything, but it was really distracting here.

Like half the film was so poorly lit you could barely see the actors faces, and virtually every dialogue sequence was entirely shot/reverse-shot.    Seemed really lazy.

The fact that so much of the movie was reused costuming and setpeices didn't help distract from it either.",2022-11-14 08:10:03

"I was hoping to enjoy this movie a lot, the trailer floored me and I was ready to have my emotions played with. Such a shame then, that after an hour of watching the movie, I got to hear possibly 5 total lines of dialogue spoken over the nonstop audience, how should we say this... Contributions. Every like of dialogue was met with a hivemind yelling and full volume talking. Easily the most miserable experience in a theater I've ever had and I had to leave half way through because I couldn't fucking hear the movie over the talking. If you're someone who enjoys talking during a movie.in a public theater, please don't reproduce. Guess I'll try again another day.",2022-11-11 06:03:54

"Some Thoughts.
Are the Talokaians immortal? Because they're killed by gunfire in the first scene they are in, then Okoye says they come back from what should be mortal wounds, then she kills Attuma by kicking him off a boat. I'm very confused by that and also, if that really killed him, it was a super disappointing last fight for him. 30 seconds then boom death by kick.
Why would Namor not kill the Wakandans when he has them all cornered, or at least take RiRi when she's right there and clearly no-one can stop them?
Couldn't Namor just flood the fucking world easily while those people siren songed everyone to death?
Why wasn't Nakia the Black Panther? Or Okoye? Or M'Baku? All three would have been better than Shuri.
How did a career scientist take on a centuries old warrior in a fist fight and win? I know she's super powered but what the fuck. If it was anybody else it would make sense.
The action was lacking, with the exception of the first Attuma vs Okoye fight, but the music and performances were very good. CG was spotty but that's because of the overload of projects on the animators shoulders.
It was fine but it could have been much better. About 15 minutes too long 6.5/10",2022-11-11 03:21:05

"I’m sorry but this movie just did not work for me. I think because it has amazing acting, pretty good cinematography and so many pieces for a what should’ve been a simple story about a girl taking her brothers role as Black Panther. But there was so much shit going on, unnecessary scenes and weird moments… It just felt very sloppy. I’m guessing a lot of it was messy because of script changes but they should’ve just made it simpler. I didn’t feel like the torch passing was emotionally satisfying… It felt so awkward. I think that would’ve been fixed with a tighter story about Shuri, Her grieving over her brother and her mom acting as her mentor… But the movie doesn’t take the time to follow through with that set up and I think it suffers for on a story level.",2022-11-13 06:58:32
"The final act was rushed, which is too bad because the movie until that point was pretty ok. CGI was also janky especially with the weird blue suits Okoye et. al. were wearing. The CGI of Shuri’s suit at the beach fight was also janky. The score on the other hand was amazing, especially whenever the atlantians(?)(sorry, not familiar with the lore) enter a scene. The initial attack on the ship at the beginning was my favorite scene.",2022-11-11 04:49:21
"Oh, man, i don't know why but i completely blanked on the fact that parts of the movie would be in Wakandan tongue, and since i'm in Spain the subtitles were just in Spanish.

Then they started speaking the other languages, including Spanish which of course had no subtitles at all, and i barely understood half the stuff people were saying, though i got the gist of most of them i feel.

Can not wait for this to be released digitally so i can give it another watch.

But for anyone saying those flying suits were hella shit? 100% agreed, holy shit, they said it was ugly and they still kept it. Even this version of the Ironheart suit was ugly as sin.",2022-11-11 21:14:52

"Apart from the Chadwick tribute it just didn't work for me. Two nations went to war over a science project. They could easily change it to a plot where Namor is losing his vibranium resources and wants Wakanda's, he threatens a war or offers an alliance, he also wants to attack the surface world and sees an ally in Shuri (Solozzo seeing Sonny as an opening).

Then, you have Shuri find Riri but get abducted, while Riri and Okoye go to Wakanda. Riri bonds with Ramona. Shuri initally sees eye to eye with Namor, but then learns of his plan to kill the queen and sees him for what he is, plus learns that he needs water to survive. We also see his army isnt war ready yet (animals and people are unwell). She escapes when Nakia, Okoye and Mbaku come to save her.

They take that time to make the synthetic herb using the gift from Namor and planning their defence strategy.Shuri takes that herb but the powers don't kick in and the attack stars, eventually they kick in and she fights using the same necklace suit she gave to Chadwick.

Ramona lives on as queen and you end with Shuri deciding to head to Haiti. Alternatively you can have Riri try to save Ramonda (but fail) and stick with the current end but still have it in the end and be it the reason she goes ahead with the fireplace ritual. It's a tighter film with less suit upgrades and no sudden revenge plot or bad war strategy (ship attack).",2022-11-19 22:33:52

Thought it was a mess to be honest. A lot of nice scenes and nice ideas but just didn't come together.,2022-11-12 15:17:44
"My biggest issues is the context of the film. The world governments are so concerned with getting vibranium....in a world with demons and magic, nano machine Stark tech, a grander universe of planets and societies full of sentient life and tech years beyond Earth, ancient godly societies with their own forms of near unlimited energy, even more ancient primal beings that stand above all, multiple alien invasions where the result was a lot of loot to plunder and yet the one thing they are most concerned about....is Vibranium?

Like for Christ's sake the Avengers discovered time travel; entirety of the Avengers heist and fight against Thanos was made public knowledge and NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS EVER MENTIONED OR TALK ABOUT A LITERAL  TIME MACHINE.

Like they literally built a 6th time machine just to send Cap back in time to return his items and stones. If the T'challas death was contingent on Shuri not being able to make a new heart shaped herb in time, why tf didn't she just ask to borrow the time machine and go back and get an herb before they were burned...this is especially doubled down because the TVA no longer sticks to a sacred timeline.


------------

Also  I know the usual gripe about the lack of cohesion in the MCU where the MC could call for help especially as the amount of alles in the MCU grows but for some reason they don't.

Like it was kind of weird for Wakanda to intervene and help Bucky and Sam in their own show....and yet not a single mention or peep from them in this movie...like not a even a showing at the funeral or a condolences to Shuri.",2022-11-15 23:44:45

Is it just me or was every new hero suit reveal kinda underwhelming?,2022-11-11 03:49:59
"So just finished watching the movie. Left thinking it was great, after a bit of time still think it was very good, but there were some clear things holding it back.

Pros

- Namor was great. His actor did a fantastic job, he was threatening in every scene he was in, his outfits were cool, his fight scenes were more of less awesome, very excited to see more of him. Him zipping through the air, into the water, onto land, and so on, was so cool.

- Atlantis was cool. The special effects for the underwater city were badass and their soldiers fighting on land were great. Also I'm a big fan of anything aztec-y so I did love all their headdresses and clothes.

- Namor was the best 'villian' in the MCU in awhile. Not just for his reasoning, but because he followed through and was a threat. He told the queen, you attack my kingdom, I kill you. Then he did.

- The tone was much different than other marvel movies. It could be very somber at times, the fight scenes would have no music, it took itself seriously. More or less. Still a few quips here and there that would take me out of the scenes.

- Killmonger showing back up was badass. I didn't think he would, but coming back as a spirit of vengeance was really cool. I don't think he will ever show up in anything again, but I would like if he did.

- Lacking the lawful good main protagonist of the first film forced all of the side characters to step up and created for some very interesting plotlines. I'm not sure how I feel about Shuri 100% but having her deal with her grief with anger and rage was interesting and something they should have played into more even. But that part of her character only shows up for the last half hour.

Cons

- Namor's final defeat felt a bit cheap to me. I really wanted the resolution to happen a different way. I know it wouldn't because its a marvel movie, but when they crashed right at the ocean's edge I was thinking - okay your plan failed, he's going to get in the water, what will you do now? How will this situation be resolved? But no he didn't go for the water he just kept fighting.

- The final fight didn't have enough spectacle and felt forced even. So you're going after the strongest navel power in the world by fighting them... on the water? They legit said they were coming back to Wakanda - why not just set a trap IN Wakanda? Why give up home field advantage? It made no sense - you even had multiple scenes showing you escorting civilians away - why not just have the fight IN Wakanda where you can make full use of your armies and fight them NOT in the water.

- In terms of spectacle these are the two most powerful armies on the planet in terms of tech. And it was just a bunch of small hand to hand skirmishes and a bit of flying around. To compare - in the aquaman movie when Aquaman comes back to the war with the mermen and crab people shit is going CRAZY things are EXPLODING and it's hype. This felt very lowkey even. Like look at this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyVdiHzq6Bw) What the FUCK is going on this is so hype. We should have had something like this but happen in Wakanda where we see this two global forces go at it.


EDIT: I also didn't like how Shuri WON that fight. Im fine with her winning but it's just so marvel to have it be hanr to hand. Here's the thing - she shouldn't have won a straight up hand to hand combat fight. Thats not her thing, thats her brother's thing. Namor has 500 years of combat experience and is one of the strongest people on the planet. She should have won with a great plan and devistating technological attacks. Coordinated drone strikes, missiles, high tech weaponry, chain guns, vibranium based attacks, tricks, literally thrown everything at Namor. But have it be technological. Show that if they are fighting hand to hand, he has the upper hand, but she can win because shes smarter, ruthless, and cunning. Hes now an even greater threat because Shuri has to pull EVERYTHING out to stop him. Thats more of what I was hoping for going into that fight. Because she wasnt trained to be the worlds greatest warrior, her brother was, she probably has some training but shes a scientist. She should have used that WAY more.

- The movie is long as shit and there's legit 20-30 minutes that probably aren't needed if this wasn't an MCU film. Ironheart / everything CIA related is not needed at all for the film to function. They are only there to jumpstart other MCU properties. You could replace Ironheart with any rando scientist then continue the movie and nothing else would change.

- That wasted time could have gone to fleshing out Namor, spending more time on fight scenes, anything.

- The midnight angel suits were both ugly and it's a stupid name lol

- Not enough blood in the fight scenes when they are stabbing and killing each other

- M’Baku should have been used more as an actual character rather than just comic relief half the time

- The fight choreography felt bad in the larger fight scenes. Just a lot of flailing and swinging while spinning to look cool while barely grazing each other. 

- Some of the Ironheart stuff didn't make sense. When they are running away, she flies 30,000 feet in the air with no mask. Why? She should have died? This is more personal but she does the classic movie writer doesn't know science and starts mumbling about euler's formula. Then blows up the drone which lands on cop cars and kills them??? She's 19 and just killed some police officers?? What lmao??

In the end I still give the film a 7.5/10. Best marvel movie of phase 4 but held back by some bad pacing, marvelisms (lack of blood, too many quips), and unnecessary plot details. Get rid of those this goes up to a 9. This movie may also have worked better as a 2 part-er frankly. Set up the Wakanda / Atlantis Rivalry, then execute on it. But still a solid film, don't think I'd ever watch it again though",2022-11-11 08:59:18

"I really wanted to like this movie and in the beginning I did, but as it steamed along I liked it less and less. You could feel the absence of Chadwick Boseman.  Characters decisions made no sense there was no stakes or repercussions. It felt like a lot of unnecessary things were shoved in this film like the CIA subplot or Riri.

Speaking of What stands out to me in this comment section is the complete lack of discussion around Riri Williams. Her character introduction felt like a dud. Her suit looked awful Honestly some of the acting from Dominique Thorne was down right bad.",2022-11-12 11:22:21
"Movie was well made but I just found it difficult to care about anyone.

Shuri just isn't that interesting a character, and lacks the charisma of a leading actor.

Okoye was fun as usual but felt underutilized. I didn't hate the suit design like some but it didn't feel that cool.

M'baku was also fun but felt kinda sidelined, which makes sense as his character wasn't as vital this time around.

I don't get why they brought Martin Freeman's character back. It makes sense to, but then they gave him nothing to do.

Ruri was a plot device more than a character, and it felt so weird to have her be important and set her up in a suit when there was no indication she was a fighter. They also didn't give her enough time to develop. She was here to be setup for her upcoming project.

Namor might be the biggest disappointment though. His actor did a good job, but the character just came across like a whiny dick. I get that he was supposed to be consumed by vengeance too, but it was too separate from his actions in the film. They also just end the conflict too easily for yet MORE setup in future films.",2022-11-11 03:30:35

"Can someone explain to me why they needed to go protect the scientist/student when the vibranium detecting machine was already invented? Was that addressed in the movie?

"That was a bit of a mess. Felt like the story grinded to a halt when they went to Namor's city. I loved the first act but didn't care for how much of the movie was set on wakanada or random beaches

Also, why did Martin Freeman have so much screentime?? The guy had no real impact on the plot after the first bit but he kept showing up. Either commit to America/CIA being a serious faction in the movie or cut them entirely

Namor's crew attacking the vibranium miners was by far the best sequence. Great music, great tension. Very good.

As a whole it reminded me of the office season 8. Chadwick's absence was felt and the other characters couldn't carry the movie. I know people hate cameos but a few other heroes being part of the plot would have helped increase the screen presence.",2022-12-03 21:37:39
"5/10 only because of the intrinsic connection to the first one. 

Pros:
-	Nakia, Okoye, and Ramonda were fantastic acting wise
-	Namor was solid
-	Special effects much improved over the first movie

Cons:
-	Fairly corny overall; lots of eyeroll moments 
-	Riri (Ironheart) was dreadful and a terrible addition to the movie
-	The movie *dragged* and I felt myself looking at my watch a few times

Overall just one of the mediocre Marvel films. It’s good that they did a sequel, but I have no interest in Shuri as the Black Panther or another Black Panther standalone film in general. Or Ironheart. Because man her character was absolutely terrible.",2022-12-03 23:40:44

The whole fighting between both countries was dragged down by the lack of blood or even wounds seen on the Wakandans.

"Feel like this movie has continued the trend of mediocre to really bad marvel movies since Endgame. 

Was pretty disappointing and felt really long in stretches. 

The guy playing Namor was good and Winston Duke did a great job again with his character. Other then that, movie was a let down. 

Im sure, based off the resume of Ryan Coogler, had Chadwick not passed, this sequel would’ve been very good, however, they had to deal with the hand they’ve had dealt and I felt it was disappointing",2022-11-11 17:43:20
"Lupita is distractingly attractive and she’s built like a brick shit house my goodness. I’d buy her more as the new BP over Shuri, but I thought Letitia did a fine job honestly and I wasn’t a huge fan of her in the first. 

Namor was just fucking cool. Him zipping around with his wings and being agile as hell was the best action in the movie. I did think the action overall kinda sucked though, and this movies fails ONCE again to show us how technologically advanced Wakanda is when it comes to fighting. 

Riri was okay but still don’t care about her show. A character in iron man armor that doesn’t haven’t a tenth of Tony Starks charm doesn’t sound appealing. The suit looked like shit too….just too clean…it had like zero texture to it and just just looked terrible. Also putting the female warriors of wakanda (forgot their names) in suits of armor defeats what makes them cool to me. 

Anyways I’d give this a 3/5 and most of that is because of Namor and his story/people.",2022-11-12 08:38:12

Namor giving shuri that bracelet was just so stupid.

They just needed something so that shuri could become black panther.

Doesnt matter if its because he values the alliance with wakanda or any other reason people will come up with to justify it.
Thats stupid.

I'm sorry, what? ""Oh yeah I built a fully functioning quantum computer"" As a SWE myself, a part of me died hearing that.

Also, what kind of logic is Namor using here - ""Wakanda better team up with me, so we can then directly initiate an assault against the entire world - a world where superpowered chumps exist at every corner, ELSE I will wipe Wakanda out."" What deep sea vent fumes is this man huffing down there. Creating conflict for the sake of plot. How his people follow this suicidal madman I do not know.

Namor's origin story and the introduction of his undersea kingdom, well done. I'll never get tired of praising Sarah Halley Finn on how she's able to cast actors that portray these characters on point.

I know Shuri's not in really in her best mental state, but man, those Midnight Angel and Ironheart suits aren't it. Should've listened to Okoye.

"I love Black Panther but found BP2 to be lacking.

However, my favorite part of the movie was the female cast. Okoye was perfect. N’yongo was perfect. Bassett honestly deserves award recognition for her work.

I loved Namor and his backstory.

However I felt that much of the story did not live up to its predecessor.

Agent Ross was severely underutilized. He purely felt functional which is not a good thing.

Talokan felt underutilized. All we really got was a quick swim through the city. If Coogler wanted to create a parallel to Wakanda, then more was needed.

The final battle on the Wakandan ship felt like a green screen CW-esque fight. Perhaps people may disagree but like most third acts in MCU films, it was a mess.

T’Challa mid-credits felt tacked on.

I still enjoyed the movie more than the other MCU films this year, but I cannot say it breaks my top 10 MCU films overall.

However, it does have one of the best performances in all the MCU. Bassett is gold! Has she not given everything?!",2022-11-20 16:22:58

We all walked out agreeing it was WAY too long, the action was lame, Shuri is way too skinny so the Black Panther suit looked weird on her- and overall the movie was boring.

"Someone once said the best thing about MCU is that they listen to reviews. As an African, one of the most annoying things about BP1 was the failure of representation, the diversity of African tribes was morbidly showcased, it basically looked like a Black American movie with a sorta African name and a few references here and there. Most native Africans said so an i thought no one would listen but they did.

I loved the constant and very much improved use of the African languages, i think pitting them against Namor helped to preserve the cultural sense and let it shine, i loved the visual representation of african elders it was real cool. I was afraid it would be not so well received by the Western audience but damn they good a good enough job that everyone could relate, kudos Ryan!!

Edit: 
Some people are saying they failing to understand how Shuri got that good after getting her powers when she barely fought before. To me it kinda sets the black panther powers into context, i failed to understand what those powers did for Killmonger and Tichala since they were already seasoned fighter, but seeing Shuri's transformation it really helped.",2022-11-27 05:19:44

"My biggest problem with Marvel films is we've reached the point where technology is just alien and ""does this thing which saves the day"".

It had always been going that way but with Infinity War and the ""nanomachines""  it really went from plausible to just straight magic. Sure there was always magic/demi-gods but the humans countered that to keep it somewhat grounded.


 Iron Man was a missile shooting, protecting from bullets, hefty machine. Even his energy pulses had mechanical charge up sounds, his flight jet engine sounds. Iron Man 2 the special, portable (giant) briefcase was the pinnacle. War Machine kind of took that place when Iron Man suddenly became magic nanomachine man.

Now Riri is just a power ranger floating about. There is very little to ground the films and feel like no battles have any weight because of it. I'm just waiting to see what magic gets pulled out of the hat.",2022-12-21 12:28:20

I absolutely hated this movie. Not a single thing any character did made a lick of sense. Namor being worried about conflict when he lives *below* the bottom of the ocean is just dumb, especially when he absolutely destroys in every single fight he's in and his people are seemingly immune to bullets, knives, M'Baku and his wooden stick, and impossible falls. The Talokans being just as adept on land as in the water felt like a contrived way of making them a threat which, again, didn't really make sense given their backstory... I know the sanitary pads on their face helped them to breathe but having them be equally if not *more* acrobatic out of the water is just silly.

"It was kind of a mess. The overall themes are fine, but the character arcs are unjustified. Like Shuri's change of heart at the end made no sense. Especially after the vision from her mother, who didn't seem particularly giving. There could have been something there. Like, the final plan was absolutely idiotic and nearly got everyone killed. That could have lead to the realization that vengeance had blinded her and she needed to re-evaluate. But the idiocy of the plan never gets acknowledged at all.

I liked the introduction to Ironheart, it's just a shame that she only had 5 minutes of screen time. Also, I'm pretty sure they didn't have a completed model for her first suit, the home made one, because it we never got to actually see it.

The montage of making the second suit was comical. Torching a ragged hole in a thick plate of steel while surrounded by the most advanced tech on the planet.

Tolkien white guy had nothing to, which was kind of weird. It should have been either a 30 second cameo or else actually lead to something.

"Ended up catching a show for it tonight,  buit feels like I may be an outlier regarding the movie.

The movie was a great sendoff and tribute to Chadwick Boseman.

But overall... I didn't like it.

I think a very big part of that was that I wasn't a fan of Shuri's character (and actress, which I tried looking past), and I was mostly just hoping Nakia would have more of a spotlight. 

Namor was really cool, though I lost all sympathy for him the moment he decided to go full warfare after losing one or two people (after he himself has killed dozens). Reminded me too much of how so many Americans only care or value American lives. 

I could see where Shuri's character development was going to go from the get go, but I was hoping for more once I realized she was indeed the only central character. 

The other aspect that I felt was really lacking in the movie was the action. So much of it felt lackluster and uninspired. Let alone the last fight, which was a disappointing end, but pretty much the entire films action sequences were bland to me. It could just be that Shang Chi spoiled me in that regard and I've now been expecting that level of care and passion on mcu action though. 

Soundtrack was awesome though. 

Maybe I'll like it more in rewatches, but I'll end this with perhaps my hottest take here

- the FRENCH??? launch a secret attack to steal vibranium from the strongest nation on earth with literally just some guys with regular ass guns 

- Same thing with the boat. The US finds the rarest strongest metal on earth in the ocean and they defend it with just some guys with guns not even a hero???

- What's preventing the US from just making more vibranium-finders unless they were stupid enough to make a one-off 

- Wakanda essentially proves the world right that they shouldn't be the sole holders of vibranium when in the span of one week their princess gets kidnapped and their queen assassinated by water people (when they got interrupted in the process of trying to kidnap a US citizen with a team of 2 people...)

- Wakanda straight up loses the war like their capital got destroyed, their queen assassinated, and their army was about to be exterminated before shuri shows up (also why wouldn't they use the goddamn fish-people-killing guns instead of spears)

"This movie had a lot to overcome with Boseman's loss and they did a great job paying homage to him as a character and person. But I also think because of that, the movie itself felt kind of off to me. I don't know how to put my finger on it, but it felt like there was just too much going on in this one and it felt rushed. 

Everyone in this did an amazing job acting. I don't think there was a weak performance from any of the main characters. And it was good to have Lupita back. 

- I liked that Marvel did something different translating Namor to the screen (with the MesoAmerican/Mayan background) and Tenoch was really good. But IMO, the character was a little too meek at times to be Namor. I expected him to be a bit more imposing I guess. But when it came time to fight, he was appropriately ruthless. I really liked Attuma and Namora as well. And the siren calls? Awesome

- I think you could've taken RiRi out of this and lost nothing. The character didn't really bring much and the movie felt overstuffed as is. 

- The CIA stuff wasn't necessary either. Also, did the Wakandans straight up kill the Boston police? 

- The costumes that Okoye and the other Dora Milage in were a misstep. Danai is a great actor and it makes no sense to cover her face. Also, why make them blue when they're fighting blue people?

"Whenever Angela Basset was on screen it was great, when she wasn't it was okay. The super science got pretty eye rolling after a bit, and the costume designs became cartoonish.

I wasn't sold on their underwater society, there seemed to be few people and not much industry or commerce. I was expecting a corollary to Wakanda, a highly functioning society. Was Namor bluffing? I wouldn't have expected to say this, but Aquaman did it better.",2022-11-16 20:18:46

"This Marvel movie paints itself into a corner plot wise. The CIA is the enemy here and it’s clear. You have two powerful oppressed nations fighting each other while the initial instigating event was the CIA’s extraction of resources. 

The logical outcome plot-wise is for the Talokan and Wakanda people to come together to destroy the CIA. But this cannot happen because it’s a Marvel movie and you can’t have the conclusion be that destroying the oppressors (CIA/USA) is the right way to go.

So, the film has to resolve this puzzle in a few ways. 
(1) The CIA isn’t ALL bad. It’s just a few bad apples, in the form of bitchy ex-wives with bad intentions. Imperialism is just a couple bad apples. 
(2) At the end, it appears that there’s unity between Talokan and Wakanda, which logically would lead to an anti-CIA/USA conclusion. But no, the final scene with the King of Talokan is him plotting for Wakanda to be vulnerable. 

I don’t really understand, though. Why paint yourself into this corner in the first place? Don’t bother with delving into Latin American colonization and the concept of Third Worldism and solidarity if you’re structurally incapable of reaching the logical conclusion of your own premise. It makes no sense.

Good

* Acting was great
* VFX were well done. Especially Namor.
* Music was nicely selected

Bad

* Riri was bleh. Her lines felt like they were written by a kid trying to act cool. Great, another super smart person that comes out of nowhere.
* The war between the Talocan and Wakanda was just stupid. Why does Namor hate the surface world so much? What's he gonna do when he has to fight on the surface against real heroes? What will he do after he wins. Nothing makes sense.
* The actual battles. First in Wakanda. Wakanda keeps saying they're the most powerful nation on the planet but they've never shown or proven that. They got invaded by Namor and could do nothing. They had no army. No weapons. They still use sticks and spears, lol. We know Talocan can be shot but it's too bad Wakanda doesn't have any guns. Their air ships were completely useless as they couldn't hit a single target except for Namor could just shrug them off. Then leaving and saying we'll be back in a week. LoL, who does that?!
* Battle 2 on the boat. Also stupid, why would you go to the ocean where the enemy is strong to fight on a boat? They got completely overrun and should have died. Namor saying he now has Wakanda as a powerful ally but Wakanda is weak af...Why do the Talocan even care at this point. They could have wiped out their entire army right then.
* The Shuri vs Namor fight was pretty disappointing. Also are we gonna gloss over the fact that she somehow knows how to fight instantly overnight as the black panther? Also, when the future of Wakanda is at stake, why wouldn't they give more people the herb?
* Those blue suits were horrendous.",2022-12-31 23:03:09
"I think we don’t talk enough abt how OP the dora milaje are. 
- Even though she lost in the end, Okoye literally held off four talokans who all had super strength and she had no armour at all. She basically killed three but their attributes kept them alive. Even then the big guy Attuma only dislocated her shoulder he could’ve done a LOT worse 

-They literally beat Killmonger in bp 1 and would’ve killed him if it weren’t for his kinetic blast. 
- In the comics they assisted T’Challa in defeating Dr. Doom Himself 
- blocked literal bullets with their spears 
- not mention how swift they are 
- plus their theme music is cold as hell

I've just finished watching the movie, and I felt like so many things were just missing or glossed over. Maybe I'm getting too old for these movies but I just couldn't connect with any of the characters.

* Inconsistent plotlines. Shuri was being empathetic with the talokans prior to being rescued. But after nakia rescues her, suddenly she's like ""The talokans are dangerous people."" Like what?? Also, i hate how the healing and sonar waves thingy are inconsistent as well.


* Riri williams being a mary sue. I know she's already a pretty woke character in the comics. Genius inventor since young age, smartest black girl on earth, etc. But i thought they would make her more down-to-earth in live action. Instead they up a notch. Build a machine at age 3? lol


* Most of the scenes in the first 2 acts are too dark. Add that with their accent, and i could barely comprehend what those scenes are about.

* The designs for the midnight angel suit and riri williams ironheart suit are pretty goofy",2023-02-16 19:40:33
How did they just let Riri return to the states? The government is going to make her build another machine and they are going to find Talokan. They just forgot the whole reason for the movie happening. Like she’s gonna go back and ride around in her car and go to Red Sox games?,2023-02-20 15:48:43

"I think the film falls well short of being exceptional. scattered thoughts:

there are good moments, but the pacing felt weird, the tone shifts felt weird, some plot points don't make sense, and some of the effects work is silly looking. Shorten it up, waste less of my time.

What was the point of Martin Freeman? The CIA enters into the equation 0 times. his only purpose is to put pressure on Wakanda to reveal Namor.

they could've done something interesting, but instead we got a lame cgi horde fight and another fatally wounded hero who shrugs it off like it was nothing. Also why did the jets fire when she said ""Wakanda Forever"". Was it just for dramatic effect?

When the French mercs broke in to the vault and got attacked, the scene was edited to shit. Same with the attack on the boat. there was basically no fight choreography

Why did shuri need to go off on the bike at the garage? what did she accomplish?

Iron Heart can build a nanomachine ironman suit overnight? I would've preferred a more iterative suit for this outing and less combat aptitude.

Why base your entire final attack so far out at sea? can't you do the same thing like, 100 miles closer to shore?

So the Wakandans moved to the mountains for 1 scene and then moved back to Wakanda?

Post-credits was really bad. If Nakia had a son, why the hell did she go off to war? Her priorities are wrong. Wakanda has plenty of similarly skilled people.

Those dive suits looked stupid, and the underwater city was so poorly lit even after the Vibranium sunrise.

Mediocre film. 6/10. it's mostly saved by some strong performances from Danai Guirira and Angela Bassett",2022-11-11 19:07:12
[deleted],2022-11-11 03:54:48
"As with pretty much any movie with this kind of runtime, there's a lot to talk about. But I'll just start with saying I thought this was good but not great. As much as this movie was able to really tackle the emotional beats and had some really exceptional acting, the action was just sloppy as hell. I could forgive that in a drama that happens to have some action, but this is a series where good action should be a given.

There was a lot to appreciate here. Angela Bassett was just incredible, and even Wright was putting in a surprising performance although she just doesn't feel like she has the leader charisma Bosewick had. The movie looked great when I wasn't having to dig a fight out of some simply unreadable shots. The city and people of Talokan were really interesting and well done. And that Michael B. Jordan cameo was a very awesome surprise.

Speaking of Michael B, I did like Namor in this movie but he still doesn't hold a candle to the great villain that was Killmonger. They were definitely still covering themes of colonization and a big point of contention continues to be how Wakanda tries to be the moral high ground where the rest of the world is happy to not meet those standards. But the plot revolving around Namor obsessively wanting to kill someone who is clearly not a colonizer and clearly is a child who had technology stolen by the government just didn't ring true to me.

It seemed pretty clear that if Namor had a five minute conversation with Riri he'd realize she's not a threat, but the movie avoids this by never having them interact even though he captures her. They were even willing to kill her in the street but once she's captured with Shuri, even though Namor has made up his mind that she has to die and it's non-negotiable, they just don't kill her so that she can get rescued. Even though Namor's backstory on exposition island was interesting, his motivation that caused the main conflict was flimsy to say the least.

Is Shuri the best option for the new Black Panther? Actor's beliefs aside, I thought she put in a nice performance and I did like the theme of ""what kind of Panther will you be?"" even if it made for a predictable ending whereas I was kind of wanting her to give in to the darkness a little. But I stand by the idea that it should have been Lupita. I imagine she doesn't want to be on call for Marvel, but she's the more badass character and the better actress and I was hoping they were holding back the reveal during promotion so they could make a deal with her.

All that said, with the hand this production was dealt and with a visionary like Coogler behind the camera, this was still a pretty solid movie. The actual action wasn't great, but it wasn't totally devoid of great action set pieces. And the way this movie handles the emotional beats makes it stand out more than your average Marvel fare. If clean action is to be expected from Marvel, successful emotion is a nice surprise when they get it right. I would give this a solid 7/10. There's enough going on that you can ignore the way the action is shot if you want, but I just can't fathom why the fights had to be so mediocre.

"The inclusion of Kamaru Usman and Francis Ngannou (at least it looked like Francis for a quarter of a second at the waterfall) was kinda weird. The camera lingered on Kamaru even when he wasnt giving lines so you knew it was him and it was just kinda awkward. Likewise it focused on Francis just to have him smile for half a second.

I'm 90% Wakanda is land locked in the middle of Africa, so isn't the most obvious solution to dam any rivers

Wouldn't burning Namore alive be the smarted play than making him sweat it out, fire will burn all the oxygen and also melt his skin. Space heaters were not a good idea

Namore was really chill until was like ""yo bro im actually gonna fuck up the world, you in?""

"Overall, I had a good time. Not amazing, but good enough that I don't regret the evening or the price of admission.

The Good:

- Boseman's passing was handled quite well.
- Movie found a decent level of humor to settle at.
- Music was *flawless*.
- Ramonda was astounding.
- Riri was amusing enough.

The Bad:

- Holy shit, the Midnight Angel suits were gaudy af.
- I didn't dislike Shuri, but damn, I just did not care about her character arc.
- Set piece for the final showdown wasn't remarkable. It wouldn't be dishonest to describe it as a big boat.
- That CIA subplot really did not need to exist.

Lastly, and I'll give this its own paragraph: I hate Namor. I have *always* hated Namor. So the movie is in an interesting place for me in that it adapts him extremely well and is very true to his character in the comics...which means I hate his guts. And not in the fun way you can hate villains, but in that way you silently groan whenever they appear on screen.

Like I said, overall, I had a good time. Don't think I'd sit down to watch this one again if it's on in someone's house though.",2022-11-11 04:35:48

"Ironheart was a major piece at the start of the movie then completely forgotten.

Okoye’s suit was awful. 

Namor was interesting, but the power of the Talukans seemed to change scene to scene.

This movie felt like 2.5 hours of Coogler and the cast mourning Chadwick and that just seemed like way too much. It sucks he died and I can’t imagine being in their shoes, but it seemed like they were just pushing it in our faces the whole time. Beginning was a great tribute to him, feels like they should have let that be it",2022-11-11 22:21:57
I would watch 2 hours and 47 minutes of just Lupita Nyong'o walking around Mexico in different outfits.,2022-11-12 04:00:39
"Just saw the movie a second time with family to give it another chance, and have to say I like it even less than the first viewing. And I was pretty disappointed in that first viewing. 

The core problem is still the fact they moved forward with the movie at all. Everyone in the film is clearly trying to mourn and pay respect to Chadwick in their own way, and none of it works. In fact, all of it hurts the actual film. This is 100% going to be a movie the filmmakers look back on in 5-10 years with regret, much like Spielberg's views on Temple of Doom. 

Killing T'Challa just doesn't work from a narrative perspective. I won't even go into how this is the *third* time the character has died in the universe (once in the OG film, once in Infinity War, and this), but dealing with the fallout of his death just consumes so much of the time and tone of the film. The result is time is lost elsewhere, namely building up the Talokans and Namor in particularly to be interesting antagonists. This leaves the film feeling like two movies squished together into one, the plot of Shuri dealing with her grief + a geopolitical thriller on how T'Challa's actions in the last movie exposed a new threat from under the sea. 

None of it works. The film is bloated, moves a glacier pace, and has none of the life or color or charm that made the first film so distinct. Everything looks like a poor facsimile of the first film, with the wonder of Wakanda looking like an afterthought to the clear drab grief everyone in the production was feeling. This also impacted Talokan, which no one prepared me for. The undersea world looks *terrible*. All washed out in shadows and lame blue lights. The color scheme and creativity that made Wakanda feel like a real place is not used here at all. It looks cheap, even compared to Aquaman which came out a solid six years ago. 

Even worse, Shuri has to carry a film the character is not made to handle. Part of the reason this thing moves like a four decade old bus is because she lacks the gravitas and charisma to serve as lead. No one else bounces off her at all in that charisma void, leaving the film without a center to make us connect with anyone in the story. 

I think it sums it up that at both screenings I went to different groups of kids were annoyed Black Panther didn't show up until the very end. At the screening tonight a pair were upset the ""real"" Black Panther wasn't in the movie. When the parents explained he has died they just got bummed again. Sorry kids, the production crew had to process their grief and we were stuck with this three hour mess. 

They should have delayed the film and re-cast. Those same kids would have figured it out the minute they saw the OG iconic suit. And if they needed to push this Namor plot out they should have just shuttled T'Challa off world or something and let Shuri lead without dragging the thing down with a thousand pounds of unresolved loss.",2022-11-26 06:58:54
"Loved Namor and Talokan, definite highlights for me.

As usual I wish for more M'Baku, Duke has major presence. Any chance his challenge at the end means he takes over as Black Panther in the future? With her battle finished and quest for vengeance over, maybe Shuri can head back to the lab and leave the violence to someone else.

To me the movie did feel like it lost steam once the rest of the cast largely fell away and Shuri had to carry. Boseman's absence was felt, Wright gave a decent performance but doesn't have the same presence.",2022-11-11 15:20:32

"A great example to show how a death of an actor totally ruined the story of the original film.

Water is everywhere, so it would be hard to stop him and I'd love to see him use the water content of someone's own blood to recharge when they try cornering him and drying him out.  ""Fools.

* He so desperately wants knowledge of his civilisation kept hidden that he will attack a water station, approach Wakanda for aid and seek the death of this scientist who is capable of building a machine that will inadvertently reveal them to the world and yet...
* He also wants to attack and take over the world which he will do with or without Wakanda's help and if they refuse to help then he will attack them first, revealing the existence of his civilisation to the world

To me at least, and this is an issue spread throughout the MCU, it felt as if they weren't sure of how to write a villain and instead fell into the trap of writing another Killmonger. 

It would have helped substantially if it were revealed to Shuri during her tour that Namor had already been militarising and preparing his people for war against the surface world and simply didn't want them to be revealed earlier than their planned invasion - we'd then have a villain with consistent motivations and not a reactive antagonist who had otherwise done nothing for half a millennia and yet supposedly has desires on conquering the world, as well as remaining secret.",2022-11-13 04:07:39

Soo shuri beats namor and tells him wakanda will protect talokan from the outside world but then runs off to a vacation and did not face m'baku's challenge for the throne. Doesn't that mean she forfeits the crown and the promise is now moot?? Mama ramonda isn't there to take her side anymore and she wont win the fight anyway especially if the power remover handicap is still on. Didn't they accept killmonger as king because he won fair and square?? what a shitshow,2022-11-14 01:37:12
"One of my dad's favorite characters is The Sub-Mariner. Like from the ""Golden-Age"". He probably would have rolled his eyes at this. Not because of how they portrayed him, because it was gnarly. But suit or not, he should have beat the shit of Shuri, inexperienced fighter (Lion gun things in the movies, no hand to hand). He's one of the stronger people in the Marvel universe.


Should have ended with the spearing her, ""chill out, we have bigger problems"" and come to a trouse. Oh well, cookie cutter Marvel ending stuff outside of not killing him.",2022-11-14 23:40:08

The Namor change is fine and kind of makes sense however, I think they could have better explained how they became the Talokanil and how he's a mutant.  
  
You're gonna tell me that a skinny Shuri with no real combat training whatsoever can beat a warrior Namor who might be ""as strong as the Hulk""?  
  
Also, they kind of just threw in Ironheart in here as she plays no integral part to the story. It could have been any random scientist that made the vibranium machine.  
  
I think they should have waited longer to do the sequel or they just should have recast T'challa. He was too important of a character to kill off in the MCU. The franchise could have been so much more.",2022-11-16 14:37:26

Also terrible decision making at the end. Fighting the Talokan on the water? Not really having a plan B? Seemed like the bp powers gave her brain fog",2022-11-22 04:41:26
"Okoye is a straight bad ass, loved her fight scene on the bridge.",2022-11-24 05:37:23
"I enjoyed the movie overall - 8/10

However, I felt it was ironic that a movie that started to feel too long halfway through when I realized it wasn’t close to being done felt so rushed at the end. I couldn’t help but sit there and feel a “that’s it” moment after the sad boat/desert fight. 

As for the CIA stuff, I’m so used to the MCU adding stuff to set other stuff up that it didn’t bother me, but I wish it felt more important for this story. 

If I didn’t know Ironheart was a thing and a future project, I would’ve felt Riri was a complete waste of time. Since I did know about Ironheart, she felt like a really poorly executed origin story. 

Everything relating to grief was well done. 

Everything with Namor and his people before the last bit of the movie was great except the bridge scene. What was the point of that shell if they were just going to attack when Wakandans had the scientist? It felt like Namor didn’t give them a chance to keep their word. 

The mid credit scene left me with mixed feelings. I had a feeling Nakia had a secret kid when Ramonda visited her, but I’m worried they won’t execute his story right. Also, the fact that the scene was literally a continuation of the last scene felt like a cheap way to have a credit scene. I wish they would’ve done something with Riri or the CIA instead to better tie it all in or set up future stuff.",2022-11-28 04:52:42
"I don't know if anyone is going to see this since it's been 18 days, but a friend reminded me of a plot from agents of shield that kinda contradicts the black panther's plot. 

In the movie, they made such a huge fuss about Riri Williams being the only person in the world being able to create a vibranium detecting machine, but in season 2 episode 11 of agents of shield, Mack was able to fit a tiny vibranium detecting machine inside a model car which he gifted to Coulson so that he could scan Coulson's office to see where he hid the toolbox. 

Even if Mack didn't build the vibranium detecting machine, someone else must have built it, which means that Riri Williams wasn't the only person who could build one. That kind of breaks the entire plot of the movie. If the government had specs on how the tiny one was built, they could have used that to build a larger one even after Riri would have been killed by the Talocans.",2022-11-28 18:35:21

Namor tried to negotiate peace, but Wakanda instead sent a spy to commit war crimes? And when Namor retaliated for their terrorism act they got butthurt and started an all out war?

And a legit Oscar worthy performance. Her death doesn't serve any goal or character arc for the other characters. You'd expect Shuri to have a simmilar scene as her mother after losing everyone.  But she doesn't. Black Panther is going to have to find a new Bosewick and a new Basset now. 

I think Winston Duke is a good replacement for Bosewick. But with Lupita out, there are some big shoes to fill for the next actress.",2023-02-22 00:38:16

I thought that when her comic was announced, but I didn't read it so maybe she's good in the comics, but she's terrible in this movie the same way I thought she'd be terrible in the comics -- total fucking Mary Sue. I know that's a loaded term, especially when aimed at any minorities, but it's simply true in this case, and if you need any evidence, this movie already has a young black female engineering genius, Shuri, and they never had to beat us over the head with how brilliant she is.  They never have to hype Shuri up, she just actually is impressive. (Ironheart is also redundant -- with only a couple minor rewrites Shuri could do everything Ironheart does.)

I at least understand that they're backdoor-piloting Ironheart -- what was the point with the CIA subplot? Goes absolutely nowhere and does nothing for the movie.",2022-11-14 20:57:47

"It was fine. Truly. Having said that…

- It was Overlong.

- It dragged and was quite boring at times.

- It became bogged down by real tragedy and was, oftentimes, merely a circlejerk to mourn Chadwick Boseman  more than anything else.

- They chose the least charismatic - and only *un* charismatic person in the cast - to take over the mantle of Black Panther

- To paraphrase Dr. Ian Malcolm, “There will actually be a Black Panther in this Black Panther movie, right?”

All in all, it was fine. It was a competently made movie. But it’s not one I’ll ever feel the need to watch again. The first was *so* much better, it’s not even funny.

Side Note: I get it would be that dark underwater, but come on - it’s a comic book movie. It looked like Zack Snyder’s Atlantis scenes. James Wan did it way better in “Aquaman.”",2022-11-11 19:09:14

"Unfortunately a lot of this movie didn’t work for me — strange editing and story choices. Ironheart and Ross felt super forced and out of place. Could be half an hour shorter with a more focused story. Messy third act. 

The recruitment scene with Riri felt like a watered down version of Tom Holland’s introduction in Civil War. I wish she had more time to breathe as a character; she felt like she was in this just to have a backdoor pilot.

Every scene with Namor rocked hard though, he stole every scene he was in. Appreciated the great tributes to Chadwick. Stunning cinematography and production design, particularly underwater. The dedication to telling much of the story in Mayan was great.",2022-11-11 07:58:29

I also think, and this might be met with criticism, but I did not like Shuri as Black Panther. I sort of wished they had someone else to play the role. I just dont think she had enough charisma or screen presence for me. 

Honestly, as wild as this suggestion probably is. I would have preferred if Shuri towards the end had died. But succeeded in making the Heart Shaped Herb. Then have Queen Ramonda take the herb and become Black Panther.",2022-11-11 16:47:23

I liked Letitia as the lead. She sold it. Attuma and Namora were pretty cool from what little we saw of them.

Coogler has a weird thing with not showing blood. Shuri getting impaling showed nothing. The ship fight showed nothing. BP1 also had a scene where Killmonger slices a Dora’s throat but it’s bloodless.

I wish Nakia had a bigger role, if not being the black panther.

Why did the talokans survive being stabbed with vibranium spear but died when a vibranium gun shot them? Why did the wakandans downgrade from blasters and force fields in infinity war to hand to hand weapons again?  If the talokans lived underwater and were stuck in 16th century tech and society, how did they mine and shape vibranium and keep up with the latest happenings in wakanda? Is riri really safe at the end of the movie? Nothing really improved for her on the cia perspective. shuri sent her home and even confiscated her suit.

Unfortunately the bulk of the movie was made up of scenes of one character, stationary, talking with another character, cut together with quick travel montages. 

Everything felt like it was on a sound stage.

Not enough action to fill the massive run time. 

I choked up more from the trailer thinking about Chadwick's passing than I did from the 60% of the movie that was devoted to talking about ""what next?"". 

The opening sequences were beautifully done, and Namor was a great character. But the entire plot fell apart for me with the single justification from him that ""the world is looking for vibranium so we must kill everyone"" and the idea that Shuri would even for a second buy in to that idea...",2022-11-14 12:15:02

The Who;e two nations at war thing was good and it was a good tight story, just didn’t work for me.

Just got out of the theatre. Good movie if you’re interested I guess.

Action wise, Black Adam is better. MOM and NWH is more memorable. 

Personally I was rooting for Namor and the Talokans. Could never believe Letitia Wright as BP with that small muscle. Her speeches was weak. Was hoping she died during the fight scene. Love Namor, the Talokan girl and the big guy. Philosophically and politically Namor is right. 

Hope they recast the Black Panther role in next movie to anyone except Letitia Wright.",2022-11-12 09:26:16
"Didn't love it to be honest. For one, it was much longer than it needed to be, but also, Shuri becoming Black Panther just didn't feel right - the role she played in the previous movie felt much more right for her. I don't know how they would have written it exactly in a way that makes sense, but Nakia or Okoye would have been much better taking on that role.

Namor was interesting at the start, but his plan to just attack the entire surface made next to zero sense and the entire battle between his people and Wakanda was underwhelming, but also pretty non sensical.

I had read that unlike other Marvel movies in this phase, that this felt like a return to form, and I didn't get that at all. Didn't really do anything to further  phase 4 at all.

I'm sure many others enjoyed it, and if you did, great, but it just didn't work for me.",2022-11-12 14:00:50

"Holy cow that was bad! Why put the dora milaje in those garbage suits? They literally looked like power ranger villains

Iron hearts suit also looked ridiculously anime-like.

"I quite liked it. A beautiful tribute, absolutely loved the use of silence. It was stunning to feel how quiet it was in a packed theater. 

Some things I didn’t like too much - the Dora Milaje mech armor was a bit much. Third act in the water ship wasn’t that great. Liked the fight in the desert but it kept changing imax ratios and that was distracting. Didn’t love some of the music choices in introducing talokan and I think it could’ve been done with more impact if it wasn’t scored with a modern pop-y song",2022-11-11 03:19:43
"It was...fine. Honestly I was more excited for this than I have been for a Marvel movie in a while.

It definitely was about 30 minutes too long. Jackson was actually my favorite part of the first one but I just don't think she has the chops to carry a movie like this. I really wanted Akoya to be the next Black Panther. 

Yes I know Shuri gets it in the comics but she has a very different characterization in the comics. In this she suddenly can fight and do all kinds of acrobatics. Ok, it is the heart herb but...

I think originally before Boseman died the plan was for Shuri to be Riri more or less just not in name. I predicted it after the first one and the fact that the Riri character in this felt a little just kinda glommed on makes me think it actually was what the plan was. 

I am glad they got to make it if only for the fact that it clearly let a lot of them process their grief.",2022-11-11 05:16:59

"So many boring, long, pointless scenes. “Is it true you found an underwater kingdom?” “Yes, it was beautiful. But they’re dangerous.”

They also forgot to put in a main protagonist with a goal who does things. By the time Shuri was sightseeing underwater, I was pretty done.

Lupita Nyong’o was just out of bounds gorgeous in this movie though. Yowza.",2022-11-12 09:13:50
"Is it weird for me to say that I wanted the movie to be sadder? I was expecting an emotional gut punch that would have me bawling my eyes out, like Tony Stark’s death. Or something bittersweet like Morgan’s “cheeseburgers” line in Endgame. But I felt a sort of emotional disconnect with this movie. There were some sad moments, but I didn’t feel as emotionally invested as I thought I would. I still think this is a good movie, but not as great as I was hoping it would be.",2022-11-13 07:00:16

"An actor is not a character. I'm sorry, we need to say that bluntly. T'Challa does not need to be dead because Chadwick Bozeman is dead, no matter how big of a tragedy it is. You could have carried on his legacy. Think of how many actors have played James Bond, Batman, etc. There are so many black male actors that could have taken up the mantle. A proper tribute and providing another black male actor the opportunity to carry the legacy was the right call. Imagine giving Dumbledore an off-screen death before the third Harry Potter movie because Richard Harris died. Now you have to multi-verse the character back or just have a Black Panther franchise that can't really continue, that's just the worst of both worlds.",2022-11-11 18:16:48
"The opening scene trying to ""save"" T'Challa had to be the weakest scene in the movie. I don't like how they glossed over his cause of death the way they did. I would have liked if they attributed it to the snap, like getting dusted and returned took away his fruit powers/connection to the ancestral plane.",2022-11-11 03:19:05

I hope they release the original script one day I really want to know what the conflict would be. I’m guessing it still would be Namor tripping off vibranium. I wonder if he still takes Shuri hostage and how T’Challa would respond.,2022-11-11 08:56:32
"Movie was... fine?

Felt like there were a lot of checklist things that need to be hit - and made for a more bloated film than necessary.

CIA parts could have been cut entirely. Ironheart probably could have been tampered down too, if not cut entirely as well.

Namor intro felt like it may have been better served as a cold-open, or slimmed down a little. The chadwick tribute obviously took precedent for the opening though.

Most of the fight scenes didn't work that well in my opinion, especially whatever that end 1v1 was. The movie did an excellent job of hyping everyone up only for the actual fighting to be rather bland. A bit of a shame.

A lot of the dialogue was really, really quiet. You have these epic musical tracks going and then they're speaking over it and it's like.. could you repeat that?

Visually pretty sweet. Great score.

I wanted this movie to be better than it was. Looking forward to more Talocan.",2022-11-11 09:11:27

"I really liked it, everything in Wakanda and the tributes to Chadwick were great but man, the Namor stuff was weak. 

The whole “we’re not so different, be better” stuff they tried to do at the end with Shuri and Namor really goes out the damn window after *Namor **murdered the queen in cold blood**. If it was Namora that had thrown the water bomb and Namor looked on with some regret or something that’s all solved, but there was literally no reason for Shuri to not kill Namor right there. T’Challa was ready to kll Klaw for less in the Korea scene from the first movie. 

I get it, Namor is a big character and making him a one off villain that gets killed would be a disservice but if the intention was to make us look forward to more Namor stuff it did not do it for me, personally. 


Really liked the rest of the movie, but the villain stuff just drags it down a good amount. 7-7.5/10

Edit: Oh yeah! And M’Baku’s talk of not killing Namor because it would mean endless war. How is flooding the city, with dozens of civilians dead **and murdering the queen** not an act of war? Nahh Shuri had every right to slice him up",2022-11-11 23:08:19

"I thought the movie was just ok. Until the Queen's death, it was pretty good. But after that it went from very boring, watching Shuri yet again try to invent something on the fly, to an overlong action scene where it was obvious Shuri would make peace with Namor. The mid credit scene was nice and poignant but there should have been a post credit scene with a typical easter egg/future storyline teaser. I understand the uniqueness of this movie as it tried and succeeded at honoring Chadwick. But ultimately it's a comic book movie and it just lacked the fun and escapism you expect when watching a Marvel movie.",2022-11-12 07:34:20
"Namor really tipped his hand coming to Wakanda in the first place. If he was as confident as he claimed in his army's ability to overpower Wakanda (which did seem justified), going there seemed unnecessary. He could have launched his war on the rest of the world, and by the time Wakanda got involved, conquered half of it. Certainly didn't need to involve them in their assassination on Riri.",2022-11-12 08:09:24

Did it say how Namor's mom knew about Wakanda? I can understand him having spys in the world so he can get information on how the world is progressing and that now Wakanda is not in hiding but how did his mom know about Wakanda 500 years ago. Maybe i missed something but im thinking maybe they have a history we didn't know about?,2022-11-14 03:28:06
"Hmmm.. definitely had mixed feelings about this movie. It started off really great, between memorial to Chadwick (the moments of silence were touching) and the Princess's struggle between modern times vs tradition.. it was all compelling. However, right after Namor floods  is when it starts to go downhill and quickly right when the battle of the Wakandans and Talokans start. Having Shuri lose all of her immediate family to fasttrack her to revenge felt like a cheap gimmick.   
I will say, bringing Killmonger back as the ancestor she sees after taking the herb was actually GENIUS. I do have my issues with him, but one thing I will give Killmonger is that he was actually making points in both movies (execution was piss poor). Everyone wants black folk to take the moral higher ground after having the worst things done to them by everyone else. Namor wreaks havoc on her homeland and kills her family, but she’s supposed to just turn the other cheek? Nah. If we not gone kill him, I would’ve at least made sure he wouldn’t be able to use them Hermes 3000s anymore. It’s funny that the film chose to go this route but then had named T'challa's and Nakia's son after the Haitian revolutionary hero T'oussiant Loverture. Those that don't know Hatian history should read up on the man that fought back to free his people. Speaking of Haiti, were they speaking Creole? I grew up around a lot of Haitians and it didn’t sound like it.. more like French.. but maybe it was actors poor replication? Haiti has so much cultural richness and Haitian Creole is apart of that. Shoutout to them including Cape Verde in the movie too, the global black diaspora was really getting its shine and we love to see it!  
Riri was really great in this film. I didn’t know what to expect hearing she was gonna be in it, but she was so relatable and funny. The only thing I didn’t really like was her final suit. Maybe it was the bad CGI or the ugly bootcut jean design with the bad color scheme..  but it looked kinda ugly. What Deputy Williams say? “Can’t fight crime if you aint cute” but no fr they should’ve reworked the design just a tadbit more. It’s frustrating that ppl say she didn’t add anything or need to be included in the movie, like did you watch the first BP at all? Killmonger’s whole deal was about how Wakanda was thriving but let black folks in the diaspora around the world struggle. I think it was great that they kept this in mind after his death. Why would they give a gifted young black girl over to Namor so she can be put to death? That would bring us right back to the whole conflict of BP 1 again.  
The battle between the Wkandans and Talokans was kinda underwhelming ngl. The Wakandans were getting WASHED so badly, I had to change sides halfway through the battle. What happened to the kinetic suit tech that Shuri created for T’Challa, the one that charged up with Kinetic energy and reflected it back? Namor is strong asf and she was struggling big time at first. Even without formal training, she had “dey strengt of dey black panta” and that suit would’ve given her another advantage. I will give her that she did get the upper hand towards the end, but she really took a beating during the hand to hand combat portion. Them lil scratches baby girl was giving wasn’t doing enough for me, I needed her to be breaking some bones.  
Overall the movie was really good, definitely different from the first but in a good way. It was its own unique story and I really loved how they explored Shuri’s journey with belief and grief. Namor was a brilliantly written antagonist, I loved his backstory and learning about the Talokans. The underwater scenes were beautifully depicted and I really think Ryan Cooler hit it out of the park again.",2022-11-14 16:30:22
"Quick question: why are some “Talokans” blue and others not? 

It’s my understanding after watching the movie twice that Namor’s ancestors drank that Vibranium potion to escape colonisation. Drinking that caused them all to “die” and be “reborn” as blue entities who no longer could live on land / breathe air.

However, in the scene of Namor’s mother giving birth to him underwater, she is back to being her original skin color…

Likewise, when Shuri goes to Talokan with Namor, she encounters Talokans living there who are not blue.

I got that because Namor’s mom was already pregnant when she drank the potion, Namor did not turn blue.

In light of that, is that why some Talokan aren’t blue? Aka their ancestors were but their descendants weren’t/aren’t?

… But if so, how is his army all blue? As far as I understand he’s the exception being this old. No one else got to live as long as him so his current blue army aren’t the original ancestors who drank the Vibranium potion…

Is that a Production oversight or is there some kind of logic to this that I’m missing?",2022-11-15 06:30:57
Loved the cop on the bridge who’s first reaction was to be like “Hey are those guys blue?” also crazy to realize Namor's actor was in Narcos: Mexico. I knew he looked familiar.,2022-11-15 19:59:50
"The more serious tone of this was so refreshing, i can't tell you how glad i am Namor wasn't out here spouting quips. Everything involving him felt really inspired compared to recent marvel outings, from his background and motivation to the visual style of his fighting. Wakanda remains extremely visually creative and interesting, and that goes for the new underwater kingdom as well. I'm so glad they went back to shooting in locations and on nice sets",2022-11-16 00:36:41
"I don’t like Shuri. The actress definitely colored that perception, but she’s just not inspiring at all to be black Panther. The best part of the movie was the mid credits scene.",2022-11-16 02:22:43
"There were some good scenes, but overall not a very good movie just like the first one. It needed to be at least 45 minutes shorter.",2022-11-16 05:01:20
"i think i liked it better than the first one: both had kind of similar villains in the 'i'm really mad at the whole world because of colonization' theme, but the motif works better on someone who has actually been around for 500 years to witness it rather than petulant child who's mad that he didn't grow up as wealthy as his cousin (im sorry killmonger stans but not sorry). that being said, Jordan ate the scenery in his cameo",2022-11-16 05:24:00
"I'm not super sold on having the son be named T'challa as well,  it's a bit too obvious of a recasting for chadwick without ""*recasting*"" him.

Damn what an ending,2022-11-18 02:03:48
The true hero of the movie was 3d printing.,2022-11-18 22:09:44
"This really works as a young woman's coming-of-age story. 

Not so much as a comic book movie. I felt the fight scenes were pretty sapped of potential. Tenoch Huerta Meija was amazing as Namor and he had great chemistry with Letitia Wright when he was showing her Talokan. >!But their fight scene was pretty lackluster, and given that he killed her mother, you would expect much more emotion between them then!<",2022-11-19 04:23:32
Did anyone else get massive Sinara vibes off Namor's right hand woman? Just something about a very quiet murder machine who detests everyone aside from their leader,2022-11-20 17:53:45
"Honestly, I think for the rewrites that had to be done because of the untimely death of Chadwick - they team did a great job of keeping things tied to a plot that made sense. It seemed to me as if everything in the movie from wardrobe to acting aligned perfectly - my biggest gripe is the cinematography. It had it's nice moments, with a few outstanding visual shots but the other 70-80% of the shots in the movie were HORRID. It felt like we were watching Spy Kids or Power Rangers at times - which for what we expected from that franchise is insane.  The cinematographer is the one that fumbled the ball. Maybe it's because of Disney's requirements as well, I wont blame it entirely on the DP. But the DP's lack of blocking, aesthetics, and lighting for the majority of the movie devalued the entire thing. The sum of the parts add up. This part gave very little to the overall experience. The latest season of Atlanta had WAY BETTER cinematography (even if it didnt have to deal with CGI). It was so wack to think ""what could have been"" if we had gotten the shots we deserved and the respect as the audience to enjoy a more thoughtout DP experience.",2022-11-21 00:30:34

She didn't even throw the funeral garment on the fire at the end but shots from above it's right in the middle of the fire lol its those little things I can't help but spot.
I loved the tribalism of the film, that was great and the engery was fantastic but the rest felt like the same old re hash and so many things felt like repetition or copying older films.it didn't feel like Marvel it was so stand alone.",2022-11-29 08:39:12
"Overall I thought the movie was pretty good, especially the action and end scene, but the thing that confused me was who the actual enemy was supposed to be. Riri didn't give the machine to the CIA(as far as I know) and the CIA was the group invading Talokan waters. The climax was hard to watch knowing that the CIA was probably the enemy they should've been worried about and that the whole Wakanda Talokan beef could've been squashed in a few sentences.",2022-11-29 23:32:53
"Finally got around to (reluctantly) watching this. I saw the first Black Panther in a packed preview screening and it was one of the quietest showings I ever saw (before it was released and became massively overhyped). It's actually only the second Marvel movie I've ever nodded off to (the first one being Kenneth Branagh's Thor), so I was in no rush to watch this sequel. Honestly, I think I've become somewhat counter-culture in the past couple of years. Movies like Dune, The Batman, Top Gun: Maverick and shows like The Rings of Power and Andor have been competely overhyped in my opinion, and I found each one more boring than entertaining. Why does there seem to be a trend for movies becoming longer and more dull and joyless? I just didn't get any enjoyment out of any of it.

I will say, the one part I did like was the ending when the film finally just quiets down and allows Shuri to mourn T'Challa. The mid-credits scene was also sweet, but the lack of any real greater tease towards the future of the MCU kind of made it feel somewhat anticlimactic. I stayed to the end of the credits and there was nothing, which was an even bigger letdown. Honestly, one of my least favorite theater experiences of the year, I don't care what the critics or audiences say.",2022-12-01 08:00:46

"Doing a run through of oscar nominees and just finished this one. Not very interested in Marvel stuff, the last marvel movie I saw was the first avengers movie, but I enjoyed this. My big complaint was I just couldn’t get interested in the Talokans.

I really, really enjoyed it. Angela Bassett absolutely brought it in every scene she was in. The women in general all felt so damn strong. 

Namor is an exciting addition that I can’t wait to see more of.

The final fight set piece was pretty bland, but I thought the Shuri/Namor fight made up for it.

They could have cut some time out, but I never felt bored throughout. This and No Way Home are a toss up for me as the best film of this phase, although I know it’s been the weakest phase of the franchise. 

Very excited to see where we go from here!",2022-11-11 03:49:09
"I don't know how racist these movies are. The Africans lower the forcefield by banging on drums rhythmically. Maybe a keycode would be better.

The evil CIA lady has a thin blue line streak in her hair because Coogler like subtle metaphors. White people are bad. A bunch of cops got killed.

How the fuck was the CIA going to overthrow Wakanda? That line does not even make sense.

Julia L Dreyfus has a large head. Never noticed it til now.

Everett's speech about them being ""good people"" was cringey. Their army stopped Thanos like seven years ago. And maybe the colonizer jokes are now lame. He was about to go to prison for Wakanda.

Iron Heart looks like some early 2000s CGI.

"I didn't mind the CIA subplot at all tbh. Ross was a big part of the first movie and it also served to showcase what countries outside Wakanda are plotting/planning for the nation. I dunno, I quite enjoyed it. 

Also, it saddens me to see literally no discussion on here of the numerous themes this film actually hyperfocuses on, like grief and legacy or the circle of violence. Can't help but feel some here legit just undervalue it simple because of it being 'another Marvel movie'.
Like, they've legitimately tried and in my mind, succeeded in make a truly big, special film. 

I especially loved how they visually showed Shuri's change of heart when she has Namor at her mercy. There was no music, no dialogue. Just images, and the audience immediately gets why she doesn't kill him.

Namor was incredible as well, with Tenoch Huerta doing an amazing job balancing the numerous facets of the character. From his perspective, you totally understand him and why he does what he does. I thought he was a fantastic antagonist and the way he explains how he got his 'Namor' moniker with the flashback just felt utterly badass. Loved it.

In a lot of ways, this film felt epic and expansive in a way very few superhero movies manage to be and yes, it's not without its flaws. I wasn't a big fan of Iron heart but I do appreciate how she was introduced quite organically, but I wish they saved her suit up for something else. 

Other than that and some wonky CG, I can't help but feel that this film just felt huge. It felt like a film worth going to the theatre for and experiencing, with a plethora of emotions on display.",2022-11-11 07:20:39
"Not a fan of this film. I loved the tribute to Chadwick with the opening scenes and how impactful they made his death throughout the film. But I don't like how they killed the queen by drowning her. I didn't like Ironhearts character at all. She's introduced to us pricegouging a fellow student at MIT. (1 Grand for any student isn't chump change.) Her entire demeanor throughout the film felt edgy and useless. Also her suit design looks baaaaad, like power ranger levels bad. Why was there a gundam flying around at the end of the movie?",2022-11-12 10:58:42

Holy shit that was bad.,2022-11-13 01:33:13
"i mostly enjoyed the movie although there’s a pretty massive hole in it which is that Shuri is just not a compelling main character imo. it’s not all on the actor because she was literally thrust into this main character role with like no build up for obvious reasons but man she does not help it, her character is paper fucking thin and the attempt at a heel turn lasts all of like 30 minutes. 

i thought namor was cool as shit although they did the thing all CBM do that robs the films conflict of any like nuance: Namors initial reasoning for having beef with wakanda made sense like why should they have to suffer because of T’Challa telling everyone about wakanda but they couldn’t have him be reasonable they were like “nah he has to want to literally murder a teenager and go to war with the surface” 

also very big last of us 2 vibes on the ending beach scene where she’s about to kill namor",2022-11-11 06:04:42

Why the hell do you call him Namor and have absolutely nothing to do with namor except for the pointy ears and wings in the feet? Might as well just call him something else, he's pretty much a new character.

"Looks like I'm in the minority here but I really liked it. It think it's a good movie and probably in my MCU top 3.


The tone was much more serious than I thought, from the Grief thematic to the mercilessness from Namor and his army (especially the mermaid songs). I went in mostly blind so it was full of good surprise for me, and both the visuals and music were great.


The CIA scenes lack resolution but they're important to show the hypocrisy of the US and how agressive they are, I don't get why people are complaining especially when it amounts to like 10min. The social commentary really hit the spot imo, I love that they called out France at the beginning and wish it would have been stronger. Toussaint is a great reference though.",2022-11-12 06:49:58

"All the Ross stuff with Val was absolutely unnecessary. Could've shaved a chunk of the runtime without it.

Was thinking on the way home that Shuri's sudden refusal to kill off Namor was too rushed. Should've had a payoff to her conversation with Ramonda about seeing the dead when in mourning by having her see an apparition of her mother while she's beating the living shit out of him and then realizes that more violence isn't the way. Could also work as a great inverse callback to T'Challa talking shit to the elders in the Ancestral Plain before he has his rematch with Killmonger in BP1.",2022-11-11 16:02:33

"Man that movie was really heavy. My first thought was to compare this to Rise of Skywalker, which similarly had to warp itself around the passing of Carrie Fisher. This movie handled that real world death much better than episode 9 to be clear, but I wonder if it didn't somewhat over correct.

I think the decision to have Queen Ramonda die in the movie along with T'Challa was too much. I mean this was a movie that already had a pall cast over it with Chadwick Boseman's death, but to have the death of Angela Basset's character be a central plot beat was just a bridge too far for me.

I think of it in relation to the MCU Spider-Man movies. Far From Home had Tony Stark's death as a central element to the story, and No Way Home had Aunt May's death as the big 2nd act plot twist. This movie kind of tries to do both these things, and it just ends up being a bummer of a film because of it.

Between opening in media res to T'Challa dying, the music-less MCU title card, the two funerals throughout the course of the picture, and the stinger being about grief, this flick just had too much death for me. I needed more levity. I needed more M'Baku. 

Don't get me wrong, I fucking loved this movie. Ryan Coogler doesn't make bad films. I just don't know if I'm going to watch it again any time soon.",2022-11-12 05:11:35
"Girl in the suit looked more like a bootleg iron man or mega man from the Nintendo Games. They wrong for putting her in that thing.

"it was hard for me to watch this with Shuri somewhat being the lead i guess? I just dont like her, she was quirky from the beginning and it was fine as a side character next to Chadwick but her being the main character, ugh, i just was not feeling it.


everyone else was doing a better job, Okoye amazing, Ramonda, what a great queen, Nakia, did not expect how much I missed her until now. 

The music was also good as well.",2022-11-12 17:29:44
"I thought the first movie was very special, it came at a time and place that can never be replicated. I like this movie but the 1st one felt like something special that could never be replicated. The feeling of pride when we first saw Wakanda, for example.

"I loved 95% of the movie, I needed way more Namor on screen. But there is one thing that felt like a raisin in my chocolate chip cookie.

Shuri's change of heart felt too rushed, her path towards wanting revenge was well shown and explained, but I felt like her not killing Namor came out of nowhere after a miniscule message from her mother. I understand the decision of not adding a ""digital fake"" T'challa, good decision, but I needed a longer, emotional talk with the queen. I didn't sense any mental tug of war on her mind about being noble and her vengeful side during the film.",2022-11-16 05:17:41
"Good movie 8/10

Just a few things that itch me.

* It's almost as if it wasn't part of the Marvel Universe, no non-Wakandan faces seen or mourned T'Challa not even out side of Wakanda other than our fav coloniser. No mention of another characters other than Papa Thanos

* Wakanda world building-  as a nation it is a mess, queen seems to be head intelligence/queen/commander (literally controlling ships by hand) , a very weak controlling structure all in all and the nation is visually depicted with depth but not in dialogue or story telling ques.

* some plot points didn't make sense but they are forgivable 

* I'm not a iron heart fan, it's rushed. 

* soo much happened in the week Naymor attack I laugh but I'll forgive that",2022-11-19 11:37:05

By the time we met namor properly, my pal turned to me and asked if i'm enjoying this. Something he never does. Then he informed me it was over an hour in. The punch of realising there was so much more film to endure just killed me

For all the talk of imminent war coming to wakanda from the world, they sat on their arses and did fuck all

The person who made this machine made it from parts found in a junkyard? Oh, that must be ironheart, considering they announced her series a while back. Hey, ironheart's in trouble? Well she's obviously going to be fine, since she's in the future line-up.

We had no black panther to protect us! Shiri has 2 suits of midnight angel, plus assists riri's suit in the space of days, it seemed. 

Shuri & AI can't replicate the heart shaped herb (which is already a fucking stupid name) using samples, but adding a different plant's DNA along with her brother's somehow solves it?

If she can print a fucking herb that ""only grows in vibranium enriched soil"" why can't she just dissect t'challa and remove whatever is causing him issues, then replace said tissue with something printed?

And fuck iff with that mid credits scene

Many more issues that i really can't be bothered trying to recall

RiRi Williams was perhaps the single most unlikable/unbelievable character I think they have ever put on screen. And the armored suits at the end looked simply ridiculous. Funny enough, I thought the same things about the first black panther movie, which also had very poor execution.

There was even a scene where Okoye and Nakia start to talk about what happened when Tchalla died, and its suddenly cut short by a big flood action set piece.  What a waste.

and wow, Iron Heart's suit was the ugliest thing I have seen so far, same with the midnight angel suits.",2022-11-11 22:08:16
"Wakanda Forever? More like Wakanda, Whatever ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

They should have recast the lead. It wouldn't be *that* big a deal and it would close up the hole left in the film. 

The glimpse of Namor's underwater empire was all too brief. 

""Join me in my conquest of the surface world or you'll be the first to fall"" is pretty dumb. If Wakanda can repel foreign interlopers terrestrial or otherwise then Namor's people can do it twice as easily given their aquatic nature AND vibranium assets. Or.. just let rising sea levels do it for them... Or, they could have defeated the surface dwellers before the industrial age set in given their prowess. 

Siren song luring soldiers to jump overboard was neat. 

Wakanda boat was kind of whack. You'd think they'd have something bigger or a hovercraft or   their own version of a helicarrier. The mining ship at the start of the film was more impressive.

By the time Namor uttered his catchphrase I had forgotten he had one. 

Bilbo Baggins' abuse continues and mounts. 

Iron Heart suit's Wakandan upgrade made her look like a glossy power ranger but it was way better looking than the Wakandan power armor. Riri's 'to catch a predator... drone' ascent was a neat callback to Ironman swapping 'icing' for lack of oxygen. 

The pageantry of Wakandan fashion continues. No points for accuracy but it looks good on camera. 

Strong performances from the cast redeem some of the film's bloated runtime. 

I can see them doing a 'Son of the Black Panther' sequel with a grown up Toussaint coming home to claim his birthright. That means either waiting a dozen years or so or doing a MCU wide time jump forward at some point to age him up to adulthood. That depends on the success of this film and its merch. The predominantly female cast makes marketing to boys a more difficult prospect and Disney has scaled down their offerings to this effect. It's the same mistake made by Young Justice. They can and should make umbrellas, backpacks, lunchboxes and whatever with the characters images and market them to girls. Which was unfortunately a missed opportunity for YJ and was one of the reasons it got cancelled the first time after two seasons.",2022-11-16 17:51:55

I genuinely think the only way I could have retained enthusiasm would have been if Marvel took an extended ‘break’ after phase 3, but that’s never going to happen when it’s a commercial monster.

All the other Marvel tie ins and the big fight at the end had me kinda bored. Also I don’t know what the stakes are when Shuri is stabbed and effectively left for dead. Then the next minute waving at everyone from an airship. 

Also Letitia didn’t give the strongest performance. It felt like a kid giving an impression of an angry teenager. *punches wall* “ah I’m so angry at my parents aaaaah!” Wasn’t the worst, but didn’t feel as strong as a lot of other entries.

Okoye, lupitas character, mbaku and even the fuking queen would have made more sense than Shuri. Who makes those baffling decisions? Can any idiot write a script nowadays?

Yeah OK.",2022-11-11 21:10:53
"Average movie imo. The score is great, the acting good i guess (watched it dubbed in German so some stuff is missing here) but the movie needed to completely cut the Namor, cut the Riri stuff and show way less CIA stuff. Or recast and do the original vision of the movie with Namor. 

The aftermath about T’Challa needed way more time, the characters aren't even really growing until the last act of the movie. And then it's way to sudden especially with Shuri. To keep the Namor plot even after the IRL death without a re-casting was not the right choice. Now you got Aquaman light without much deph and we learn almost nothing about their society at large. Even his motivation is not really good enough for a movie that wanted to tackle a more serious topic. In Phase 1 Ok, in Phase 4 they need to write some more lines and more background for their ""villains"" in their movies.

Should have made a political thriller were the internal and international politics are the main focus and where the characters/actors are the driving part of the movie. Like everything else it's kinda in there but just not enough to make the movie about this one thing. Dunno if they didn't trust the cast to carry such a movie but now it's just a random marvel movie where they need to rush through the movie to not only show the main story but also 2 side stories and the impact in the marvel universe in general.

"anyone else think the writing was all over the place for this one? Did they have to do a quick rewrite after Boseman's death or what?

The leap in logic from killing a scientist to preserve the secret of talokan to conquer the entire world was pretty wide. The reasoning behind it also makes no sense since he hated the imperialism that destroyed his ancestral lands, so he's gonna stop it...with imperialism. It seemed alot like recycling of killmonger's motivation, but atleast killmongers plan made some sense. Killmonger wanted to provide weapons to stage coup d'etats across the world to upend a status quo that he believed couldn't be changed due to the large power disparities that exist without vibranium weapons. Namor wanted to invade the land people he probably couldn't hold with his fish people that need water and wear armor that covers everything, BUT their vital areas (I love the designs, but c'mon, there is somekind of mmo female bikini armor logic going on). He also had like 400 yrs to invade before the guys with muskets became flying metal weapons of mass destruction and jacked to the gills with super soldier serums.

Also, I'm just gonna say it, the final ironheart suit looked alot like a fanfilm power ranger suit. I'm guessing this has to do with marvel's increasingly worsening reputation on being difficult to work with for animation/cgi studios",2022-11-14 04:36:16
"Namor's backstory was well done and so were all the ""tribute to T'Challa (Boseman)"" moments but otherwise this movie was a mess. The justification for the fighting was incredibly flimsy, making it hard to care about any of the action. The dialogue was also way too expository and overwritten but that tends to be the case with most of these movies.",2022-11-14 22:56:40

"I think it's pretty good for the direction Marvel has been going for the last years. However, there are two things that felt meh to me. 

One. It's a good story about seeking revenge, but I am tired of ''revenge is evol'' story. Like, let's watch a character that goes through with their vengeance and then confronts the consequences. IDK

Two. It's just feels to damn long. I mean, I get why it is but it's too much. I really don't need a tour of the underwater city or the entire background that is so ''gracefully'' exposed to us. Just, ugh. 

&#x200B;

PS

This is just me, but whenever Killmonger came into the screen I felt a little sad. If they hadn't kill him in the first movie he came in and instead just imprisoned him (like Tai Lung lol) this movie could be a redemption arc for him. I mean, Black Panther is dead, the royal family is in shambles and there's a new threat to which Wakanda is not ready for. 

I don't mean making Killmonger the king, but forcing him to become the Black Panther Wakanda needs, to live up to the expectetions of the man that spared his life. And sure, then Namor and Killmonger could kill each other in the final battle. Idk, it's just sound kinda fun lol.",2022-11-17 01:04:26

Just watched the movie and I'm disappointed. Didn't feel any character except Namor. The snobbish wakandans really really frustrated me. The Namor character was really refreshing and it really wasn't necessary to make a second movie in my opinion. But maybe they needed it to establish Namor and the Talocan empire.,2023-02-06 12:32:38
"Ok, I feel seriously conflicted about M'Baku as a cultural representation and would like to have a sincere and civil discussion about it. Let me start by saying that I love his character! He's aggressive and strong but rational and reasonable, he's playful but serious in a blink, he's opportunistic but fiercely loyal, shrewd and discerning while being a touch enigmatic, he's a dependable leader to a strong people that removed themselves from Wakanda and is still a close friend of the royals in wakanda. Seriously, he's my favorite character. All that said, I still cringe a bit at his portrayal because he's also one of the only ones that makes monkey noises and I thought we weren't supposed to depict or portray black people as primates because that is a significant racist trope?? No disrespect intended to anyone, I'm just trying to make sense of it. I understand the ape's significance in this context and the Hanuman worship (even though they allegedly had to censor that detail for India?) aspects of his tribe, but still, damn, that's really hard to reconcile with the social guidelines that have been firmly enforced and reiterated by black activists and Hollywood throughout my life. But I also understand that Wakanda is really just a generalized Africa blend seen through a western lens, it still just feels weird to have that be acceptable situationally.",2023-02-06 16:22:24
"The funeral scene for T'challa was beautiful and actually had me sobbing. It did seem a bit weird (though understandable) that there was no big emotional send-off for the Queen, though.

"I hate to say this but the movie was pretty bad.

The Bad:

It was boring, amateurish, cringey at times, and even though it was supposed to be a blockbuster if felt low budget, it felt low stakes. No sense of anyone outside the 2 factions being in any danger. Namor's motivation was weak. Now there's Wakandan Iron man suits? what?. Ironheart was wasted. To many callbacks to previous movies, hardly original.

The Good:

Namor was ok. Micheal B. Jordan good.

I doubt it breaks $800 million.",2022-11-11 23:54:33
"Quite possibly the worst mcu movie. An extreme simple story that gets treated like a shakespearean drama with endless dialogues that never lead to anywhere besides even more boring dialogues. Poor action besides the military ship sequence. Extremely bad use of music with at least three sequences that felt like music videos. And most importantly none of the main characters can lead the movie, let alone Shuri who was the most boring of all. Namor introduction was superb, but ended up being villain of the week plus his retconned origin was lame as hell.
Even the bloody mid credits scene was more babble!

Boring, unexciting, simplistic yet pompous at the same time, with poor music choices and a lead character that can't be a lead. Avoid.",2022-11-12 23:16:41

"I can’t remember the last time Marvel/Disney made a serious MCU film without cramming jokes in every scene. It’s refreshing, brings me back to the early MCU days circa. 2008-2012. Great film I’m glad the villain wasn’t actually a villain and gave the audience good reasons as to why he did the things he did.",2022-11-12 11:10:43
"What annoyed me from the start was Shuri rushing to make a cure for what was affecting T'Challa when in real life Letitia Wright is an anti-vaxxer. It really ripped me from the emersion. 

I know grief can do different things to different people, but Shuri just came across as unlikable for the whole movie. It is safe to say I didn't like her in the first movie, and I liked her even less as the lead in this.

Highlights were Winston Duke as M'Baku, Danai Gurira as Okoye, Michaela Cole as Aneka and Dominique Thorne as Ri-Ri Williams. 

I genuinely think Okoye should have become the Black Panther after she was stopped of rank.

There were a few glaring problems, such as the ""AI"" scene and no mention of what happened to Talokan or it's people during the ""blip"". Namor wants the surface world to burn, but it was the surface world that returned half his people with no help from him.

Overall a solid 6 out of 10, plot wise. The tributes to Chadwick Boseman were well done and a touching tribute.",2022-11-12 17:40:06

"I wouldn't say it was the worst MCU movie (black widow for that), but I thought it was boring and way too long.

 I took my son who is 7 and I was shocked to see kids younger than that to be honest. He generally enjoys these movies which he has started watching this year and claims the first black panther was his favorite. Basically if he had to review it the whole movie was like this to him ""when is black panther coming? 20 minutes later...is he coming? When?...Then the end scene when she shows up....thats not the black panther thats the scientist girl...yes but she is black panther....oh well you lied to me you said black panther was in this movie!"" 

And really that is when it hit me. Not saying you can't make a good story without Black Panther, but it just felt like the beginning was rushed with an automatic death to Black Panther. Yes I know they were not gonna show a CGI Chadwick, but I feel like not even showing him in suit laying on a table etc really didn't register to a younger audience that black panther was gone.

Also I feel like the whole plot of her becoming the Black Panther was rushed at the end. They should have just introduced it mid way, which I feel like they should have done and incorporated Iron Heart. The whole sub-plot around Iron Heart seemed to cliché to make her relevant. Like how do they have a whole mission around her device and yet don't think to secure her before that mission even takes off?",2022-11-14 21:03:16

"Nowhere near as good as the first but a pretty solid sequel, especially considering the original lead actor has barely been dead two years and they've already produced something that isn't a total mess.  
  
Good:  
\+ They handled Boseman's death very well. It was incredibly surreal to see them basically translate similar circumstances of his real death into the story but it absolutely worked.  
\+ It's a shame Letitia Wright is an antivax chud because she gave a great performance and it'd be disingenuous to deny that.  
\+ Angela Bassett was great.  
\+ Namor was a neat villain. Wasn't always convinced by his motives but he had great presence.  
\+ I liked how it was a lot less funny than most MCU films. They really let the dramatic scenes breathe without constantly punctuating them with quips.  
\+ Talokan and Namor's people were really interesting.  
\+ Killmonger cameo was great. I wasn't thrilled about him returning but making him the Devil on Shuri's shoulder was a fun idea.  
\+ Loved how quiet the ending was. A lesser director would've drowned the montage in a corny orchestral sweep.  
\+ Rihanna song was surprisingly good.  
\+ Post-credits was really affecting. It'd be easy for the inclusion of a son called T'Challa to feel like a cynical replacement but I think it worked well.  
\+ Ludwig score was great.  
  
Bad:  
\- It's WAY too long. This was in dire need of a tighter script or a tighter edit in the very least. There are so many excess subplots and characters, and the 2nd act in particular feels very saggy. I would've been happy with almost all the Everett Ross/Valentina scenes being cut.  
\- Riri's inclusion felt pretty forced, like she came from another script entirely. Had no problem with the actress but she barely felt like a character here and I could just see the Disney+ Content Platter cogs turning because they need to set up the Ironheart show. Reminded me of America in Doctor Strange 2 - some random young kid who ends up being central to the plot without much of a personality that I don't really give a shit about.  
\- Coogler's direction seemed a lot spottier than before. A lot of visual storytelling moments felt really awkward and clumsy like they didn't come together in the editing room properly. Cutting from Ramonda swimming up to the surface to her face down in the water was weird to me, also Namor suddenly showing up on Shuri's ship and being like ""pack it up guys"" just felt off, especially given all the death that just occurred on both sides.  
\- M'Baku ""challenging"" for Black Panther confused me a bit. I thought it was meant to be a joke at first but I'm honestly not sure.  
\- Wasn't totally convinced by Namor's motives. I think him being mad at Wakanda was totally fine but after that it just keeps snowballing into ""help me take down the outside world"" and it just felt quite contrived.  
\- Some very wonky CGI. Namor flying around looked goofy as hell as did a lot of the final ship fight and, er, the Ironheart suit.  
\- Lack of standout action. A few cool beats but nothing that really blew me away. The coverage felt very pedestrian especially in the final fight.  
\- Midnight Angel and Ironheart suits looked AWFUL lmao. Jesus.  
\- The Gay Moment near the end. Typical shit that can be easily cut for bigoted markets. At least they didn't spend weeks in the press patting themselves on the back this time I guess.",2022-11-11 14:35:09

A lot of concepts shoved into what was a movie with the vibe totally off because everyone involved was still clearly mourning Chadwick. Some good things like Namor did come out of it, but man are they going to regret this one in a few years. It's going to age really badly, much like Love and Thunder.

They should have just waited and done a re-cast when they were ready. Maybe done a totally separate sort of spinoff movie about Shurri and co getting involved with a conflict with the Talokans. 

Phase 4 has sort of been a mess.",2022-11-11 18:03:27

The movie just kind of plodded along and lacked much excitement. Too long!

I did like Namor, but his whole story just didn’t seem to mesh with the world of Wakanda.

The entire subplot with Martin Freeman and Elaine also was just kind of there. Obviously it’s setup but why do we care?

EDIT: Forgot to mention the subplot with the young Chicago girl was pointless too! She was just there. Not interesting and barely added anything. The fact I forgot about it already speaks volumes.",2022-11-12 08:16:13
"Movie dragged a lot, way too long runtime. The writing was inconsistent, the humor just plain bad. Riri Williams wasn't a likable comic book character and she's no better in the movie. Her and Okoye's suits also look Power Rangers level bad.

It's an interesting interpretation of Namor, but to me he doesn't live up to comic book Namor, who is far more insidious. Then again the MCU hasn't hit the mark on that for a while now. The new cultural spin is interesting, but this is kind of erasure of the Atlantian mythos? I'll take what I can get I suppose. 

What really just let me down was Shuri becoming Black Panther. You cant convince me that if she went through the same trials and tribulations T'challa went through to become BP, she would come out on top. It would've been an interesting moment to leverage the multiverse happenings and put Michael B Jordan in the role.

Angela Basset great as always, Martin Freeman too but he really only served to set up the Thunderbolts.

I feel a sense of relief that this movie closes out the current MCU phase. It has been a long string of mediocrity and this struggles to give it a highlight. I can only hope Ant-Man will be significantly better.",2022-11-12 08:24:18

"This movie was such a piece of garbage. I lost track of the number of plot holes in the movie. Before I watched it today, all I read was positive reviews and I was so confused when the film ended. I get that them losing Chadwick was a major setback and they were forced to go back to the drawing board. But what they came up with was inexcusable. 

First, the movie would've fared so much better if they stuck with fewer characters. I still can't see how Riri, Ross, Vel, etc. contributed to the plot in a significant way. 

The motivations and grief expressed by the characters seem so damn shallow. I never once felt sad, apart from momentarily feeling the characters pain when Namor first comes across Spanish slave owners and when Shuri tries to frantically save the Talokan prison guard from dying. 

Ramonda, Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, and Riri all seemed so plastic with their acting. For one I just did not buy their accents. The dialogues written for them just made me cringe during every scene. I don't get how the ""coloniser"" comments are funny even as an Indian. It just makes the Wakandans look like racist fucks with a superiority complex. 

If you liked this movie, I'm sorry for expressing such distaste for it. I wish I liked it too as I'm such a huge fan of the Black Panther and Wakanda. I was really looking forward to this. 

Marvel really needs to start putting more effort into phase 4. Underneath all that CGI and spectacle is just a story that makes you want the film to end so you can leave the theatre and go home. I really love the actor playing Namor. It was such a such a shame to see this franchise go down the this route.

Lastly, someone needs to tell Ryan Coogler that it's possible to express Black Pride without aggressively trying to shit on white people. I don't understand how their comments are even allowed. Superiority can be showcased in ways other than constantly shoving rhetoric that flexes how advanced Wakandans are in every way. People who are stronger and wiser don't feel the need to chest thump every passing minute. This is what made the Black Panther such a mysterious and badass character in Civil War. You just knew this character wasn't to be played around with just based on how T'Challa presented himself to the world.",2022-12-07 20:22:31

"My experience of watching this was dampened slightly to start with as i had to queue for about 40 minutes for the iMax screening i booked due to Odeon's 2D iMax ""content bring corrupted"". They ended up not being able to fix the issue so then i had to go into the nearest screening which was scheduled for 20 minutes later which then also had ads and trailers at the beginning of course. 
I've never worked in a cinema so I'm probably being ignorant here but i would've thought the ""content"" would be tested before the day of release. Especially for a big film like this.
Don't worry, i didn't take out my frustration with the situation on the people at the bottom who were having to deal with customers.

Anyway, the film has some of the usual MCU issues of having some very noticeable CGI at times and looking fairly samey to some others but for what it was i thought it was pretty good.
It didn't blow me away but I liked the story and characters. The beginning and closing tributes to Chadwick/T'Challa were very moving and respectfully done and I liked how they had a cameo appearance that didn't feel cheap and worked for the story.

The action was a mixed bag but i really liked the music that often accompanied and it made a difference when one pivotal fight scene had no music at all until the last moments.

It's a shame that from what I've heard Letitia Wright was a real pain in the arse during the pandemic and when filming this. I like her acting and her character.

"Loved everything about Namor and the Talokan lore (until they had to give Namor typical dumb supervillain plans). They did an amazing job paying tribute to Chadwick. The Killmonger cameo was really well done.

This movie is way way too long though. There were multiple times I could literally feel the length which is never a good sign. Hated everything about Ironheart/Riri Williams. Everything about her character felt exactly like a copy paste of America Chavez from MoM. Also was not a fan of the CIA subplot, and even Shuri’s character to extent. It’s not her fault that she’s in this position obviously, but I just don’t think Letitia Wright is a strong enough actress to be the #1 protagonist for a franchise. I felt like they were building up to either Okoye or Nakia taking the BP mantle and then it just doesn’t happen?

And god how are Marvel getting worse and worse with suits as time passes ?",2022-11-12 21:51:25
Found myself watching for Namor and hope they don’t do the classic villain to 100% hero in the future movies lol. Fairly average marvel movie and had fun. RIP Chadwick. It would have been a much better movie with you,2022-11-12 23:12:10
"I liked the film over all, Okoye is just all round badass.
Our experience was ruined by a row of rowdy people talking, taking their phones out and throwing stuff (sweets and fried chicken of all things).",2022-11-12 23:44:22
"Thought it was pretty good, a tad boring tho.. what was the point of the FBI stuff?",2022-11-12 23:48:03
"I gotta say, namor was an ice cold dick killer.",2022-11-13 00:30:06
The scene where Ramunda was holding T'Challa's mask in the ship with Okoye mirrors that one scene from the first Black Panther where T'Challa prepares for a mission.,2022-11-13 02:22:14
Really enjoyed this movie but damn this just makes me even more sad at just how tragic Chadwick's passing was and what great performances we were robbed from. Shuri did a decent job at fulfilling the mantle but his presence was definitely missed from the story.,2022-11-13 04:15:38
"I'm kinda confused as to who is in charge now.

They leave it open that MBaku is challenging for the throne...but I thought only the black panther fought for the throne? So our black panther doesn't have to fight for her role, but the king/queen does?  That doesn't make any sense. And if this is the case, why didn't the Queen have to fight for her throne?",2022-11-14 04:01:58
Namor was giving off Mr Nimbus vibes lmao,2022-11-14 09:21:18
I was getting major Kotal Kahn vibes from Namor and his warriors. Even the sound effects were very Mortal Kombat esque - that scene on the bridge was the standout for me for sure!,2022-11-15 02:51:13
"I simply loved this new origin of Namor the Sub-Mariner and while we don't see much of his undersea world what we do get is pretty impressive - his warriors are certainly cool looking and badass, not to mention the fact that they ride Killer Whales - but where the character does get tripped up is in his rock stupid attempts at diplomacy and tactics, you don't declare *""Join us in destroying the surface world or die""* as that's not really going to get you anywhere with a country as prideful as Wakanda.  Then you attack and kill their bloody Queen and expect more threats will work, at that point they should have continued the attack instead of giving Wakanda time to regroup and retaliate.",2022-11-16 03:56:00
My only issue is Queen Ramonda dying. Hasn't Shuri lost enough,2022-11-16 05:58:07
"Enjoyed the movie.  Thought it was better than the first one.

However, I really would be interested to see what the draft of this movie looked like before Chadwick Died.  What all the changes were.  They've talked about it having a lot to do with him missing out on things during the blip.  

Anyway, the characters were great all around.  Angela Basset was just so powerful. I loved her UN speech putting those french asshats in their place. I'm mad she's gone. 

The CIA storylines was lame.  I know they have to keep shoe horning Val because the Thunderbolts. But bleh, they had too many scenes. I guess Martin Freeman lives in Wakanda now?  He can take Bucky's house haha.

The fight scenes were great.  Except for the one at the end where they're all standing on a floating slow moving barge with no defences.  And that Midnight Angel suit was awful.  But kinda close to what the masks look like in the comics.

The character intereactions were great. 

Riri should be a great addition to the MCU and I loook forward to seeing Ironheart. 

I was very much expecting Nakia to have been pregnant.  I'm sure most people did.  But to then call the boy T'Challa as well?  C'mon son!  We knew they were going to replace Chadwick for BP3 but this way? Haha, ok.  The only problem is most of the MCU movies are happening around the same time, so I don't know how they'll be able to get this child into the suit without a massive time jump that would separate BP3 from the rest of the MCU. 

I love what they did with Namor.  I love seeing mutants popping up into the MCU now.   Hope his wing grows back.

The Killmonger cameo was not expected but I dug it.  

Finally, the memorial to Chadwick inthe Marvel Logo was great.

it's just great to be able to sit empty theater and enjoy movies like this.",2022-11-16 06:11:14
"That suit of Okoye's was ridiculous lmao. Interesting design for sure

Not a good as BP1 because of Chadwick, but still good imo",2022-11-16 13:11:21
"We are just going to skim over this movie introducing real, actual mutants to the MCU?",2022-11-16 13:59:26
"I have to say, this felt like two different movies that got thrown together. On one hand, one of those was fucking. Phenomenal. On the other…not so much",2022-11-17 07:50:53
Lol they spare no police lives during this movie. Police bad!,2022-11-18 05:07:43
"Anyone know what the queen was going to
say about T'challa when Neymor interrupted them next to the lake?",2022-11-20 09:29:58
"I didn't like the first BP. Went in with no expectations, even wanting to dislike it but I was pleasantly surprised. I think it's because I saw it as more of a fantasy genre movie between two fantasy civilizations and not a Marvel movie.

I really disliked the Riri Williams plot device. They didn't have to bring her in at all. They could've reworked the vibranium finder plot with someone else. Every time her Ironheart was on screen, I was ripped out of the movie and was reminded ""Oh, I'm watching a Marvel movie"" and not this cool conflict between two interesting civilizations.

The CIA subplot? Eh. Should've been cut, too, and reworked.",2022-11-20 15:27:17
"What was the point of the rare jellyfish from the beginning that the divers saw before being attacked? Was it all to foreshadow Namor
breathing like a jellyfish?",2022-11-21 17:45:41
"I didn’t know who would end up being the new BP, but when Riri said, “Can I get some of that?” I thought it was foreshadowing. I wish it were! Since the heart-shaped herb is synthetic, presumably they could print as much as they wanted. Wouldn’t it be a great twist if Riri and maybe others got BP powers as well? Would have certainly helped fight Talokan as well.",2022-11-23 14:37:46
"Black panther will return, everyone in the cinema universally threw there hands with a what the hell, we're so used to getting clips or something of the next release this was a shock to all.",2022-11-24 06:31:38
I liked the film generally but there was one particular part that I didn’t like >!when Okoye’s rescuing the guy from the van being arrested (don’t remember his name since he’s not the most important character in the movie/s) & she makes the remark abt seeing a colonizer in chains & now she’s seen everything.!< It makes me think abt the comment Quentin made on some podcasts when he said how everyone needs to be politically correct & directors/screenwriters even inputting part of their own political ideology now. I totally get the message based on how I grew up but it dilutes the quality of the movie taking Marvel jokes to a more potent level leading to not as much enjoyment personally.,2022-11-26 11:48:01
"On the first movie, T Challa drank something that made him lose his powers. Any chance that can also weaken Namor since both of their powers came from the same source",2022-11-28 19:19:33

Why does it make more sense to have muscular men hold a rope instead of mounting onto the ship,2022-12-05 02:56:30
"My wife was like ""... so do they come up to the surface just to pick decorative feathers?"" Lol",2022-12-11 03:26:23
"i have several gripes after seeing this today. i would love for someone to explain some of these to me in case i missed something:

1) the entire conflict of the movie makes no sense. the talocans want to attack wakanda for other nations hunting vibranium, namor claiming its because wakanda revealed themselves... but this is lliterally wrong. the world has been hunting vibranium long before they revealed themselves, to the point the events partially in the first film were sparked by it. namor immediately soured the allyship by (wrongly) accusing them and attacking them instead of just coming forward and saying ""hey, we are a nation in the same boat. wanna help each other?""

2) killing riri was also overly hostile. even if she was the only way for the surface to track vibranium (unlikely once she made the first machine), going straight to killing her makes no sense. he could have just reached out and explained/threatened her not to make it again.

3) the war itself also didn't make sense. they make it seem like it would be one sided for either, let alone in favor of the talocans. as far as war tech goes, the wakandas in previous films have been shown to be way more technologically advanced than them, with the most advanced thing the talocans have being their water bombs. none of what they do should have worked on wakanda (aside from the siren thing).",2022-12-26 03:06:07
"I noticed when Nakia takes Shuri and Riri back to Wakanda that she didn't bring a capsule for them. How did they survive getting out of Talokan? When Shuri tells Namor she wants to see it he says ""your blood will become toxic and the pressure of the ocean will crush every bone in your body....or we have a suit!"" As much as I love his delivery of that line it makes me wonder how they got out. I imagine where they were being kept it was more like a way point but wouldn't it still pretty deep. Is that why they didn't show them being taken there, just waking up there?",2023-01-11 16:59:11
"They did a willheim (sp) scream in this....that's all you need to know.

The pacing too....is glacial, and the cuts are so weird to me",2023-01-31 06:52:30
"I was going to write a long list, but I can't be arsed. So I'll just write, meh instead.",2023-02-01 11:47:35
"I’m confused, when you committed murder you have to be on trial (Nemor)? So Wakanda is a unconstitutional monarchy, with battles to death elections and which has not ratified the United Nations  laws and keep Africa in a kind middle age stage. Wtf Disney ?!",2023-02-01 21:57:54
I know I'm late to the game. But how does namor talk underwater to shuri when she's in the bodysuit.  It doesn't seem like the other underwater inhabitants talk.,2023-02-01 22:54:36
"I have to say the comments here are some of the wittiest and funniest I have ever read in a Reddit. A joy to read and they truly describe and critique the film. 

Personally I am not happy we lose the entire Atlantis thread here. I am not sure if that is an attempt to be cooler with surviving Aztecs or because Aquaman has already done it. Namor always seemed derivative though honestly I don’t know who did it first.",2023-02-01 23:45:37
"Despite the source material, I would have bet cash money they would have made Lupita Nyong-o the new Black Panther.",2023-02-03 02:35:15
Any idea why the images are all purple and green in the movie ?,2023-02-05 09:37:47

"Watched this the other day and really enjoyed it, aside from it being a little too long and the CGI looking like ass.

In terms of the mid-credits scene though - have they just set up a House of the Dragon-esque succession crisis for BP3?",2023-02-10 12:20:13
"Let's talk about the Marvel movie Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the most recent Black Panther movie. As both a content creator and consumer, and as a Christian, I think it's very important to keep in touch with the current and relevant trends in the entertainment industry.   
  
So let's discuss a popular, current, and relevant movie!  
  
The film opened with one of the most poignant and well-crafted displays of grief and mourning I've seen in cinema to date. Following the death of the former Black Panther actor, Chadwick Boseman, the film chose to honor him in a way that struck me as both truthful and inspiring. The first scene of the movie was dedicated to the funeral of King T'Challa after he succumbed to a mysterious illness. The acting was impactful and heartfelt, and when combined with the skillful writing and cinematography displayed in the movie, the effect was an incredibly impactful, yet uplifting portrayal of loss. In the scene, T'Challa's family, notably his mother, Queen Ramonda, his sister, Princess Shuri, and a close family friend, Nkoye (seen as a pall-bearer in the funeral procession) all wear white from head to toe. There is joyful singing and dancing accompanying T'Challa to his final resting place in a clear celebration of his life and dignity. The scene has a striking contrast between the crestfallen and grieving faces of some and the peaceful and joyous faces of others. While his closer family struggles to deal with the loss, T'Challa's former subjects honor his memory and his great deeds by lifting up their voices and choreographing beautiful dances.   
  
The scene is such a powerful and skillfully crafted testament to the dignity and sanctity of life that is firmly rooted in reality despite its fictional nature. The acting is so poignant and well done that the movie has the effect of taking a very real and sacred human emotion and exemplifying it by means of a fictional world, culture, and characters.   
  
Don't let me throw you off with my initial description of the movie though! Following the initial heart-wrenching first scenes, the rest of the movie is well-written, well-produced, and lifts the mood considerably. There's a particular scene where Shuri and Nkoye are sent to extract a young scientist, Riri from an American college to Wakanda for her safety and the writing is incredibly realistic and humorous. Marvel movies can be prone to tone-deafness, but this scene was a fantastic example of what Marvel is still capable of with a team of decent writers. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that the dialogue in that scene and in several other scenes of the movie was a refreshing display of balance and realism.

With this said the main criticism I've heard for this film is that the writing and development of Dominique Thorne's character was a little rushed and sloppy. While I don't personally have a problem with it and really enjoyed the actress's humor and casual-genius type, I do agree that the writers could have done better and I think it is important- both for the audience and the actors Marvel hires- to do them justice by writing well-thought out and skillfully-developed roles for them. 

Besides this minor flaw, I found the movie to be enjoyable and reminiscent of Marvel's glory days. Although, after the release of She-Hulk, one wonders if Marvel's golden era truly died with Stan Lee.   
  
When you watch the movie, be sure to stick around for the credits scene! The only credit scene in this most recent Marvel movie has one of my favorite spoilers to date. It is one of the most stunning, uplifting displays of hope, the sanctity of human life, and the healing qualities of time and trust that I have ever seen in a Marvel movie. It clearly shows the attitude of the writing team for this movie and how they chose in this instance to approach the topic of life with a truthful, uplifting, and inspiring mindset. 

If you weren't planning on watching this movie or were concerned that it would be a try-hard or politically-biased film or were simply not interested in the Black Panther franchise without its hero, Chadwick Boseman, I would encourage you to give the film a chance with an open mind. 

Ultimately the movie was a heartfelt tribute to the beloved former Black Panther actor and did a passable, if not enjoyable, job of passing the torch and continuing the legacy of one of Marvel's classic heroes.",2023-03-21 20:35:42
"I can’t get my head around how Shuri and Namor flew back on a ship at the end? 

Wasn’t that thing destroyed by Namors vib spear??",2023-05-06 21:51:55
This is one of the more boring MCU films I've seen. Does it pick up in the second half?,2023-05-23 18:05:53
"I did not like the way Queen Ramonda treated Okoye.  She's a warrior who gave everything to her country, and then she was shamed and dismissed.",2022-11-11 03:17:00
"pretty much a total mess that’s ugly as all hell and cut together horrifically. thought a lot of the emotional beats were good and the funeral scene was excellent. otherwise, shocked by how disgustingly ugly the underwater stuff was (ironic considering the avatar trailer before the movie started had some of the most gorgeous water cinematography i’ve ever seen) and the action was nearly indecipherable and cg was awful",2022-11-12 02:46:53
I wasn't a big fan of the soundtrack choices. Every time that *chook chook chook chook* sound started up it totally took me out of the scene.,2022-11-11 03:12:48
"What annoyed me from the start was Shuri rushing to make a cure for what was affecting T'Challa when in real life Letitia Wright is an anti-vaxxer. It really ripped me from the emersion. 

I know grief can do different things to different people, but Shuri just came across as unlikable for the whole movie. It is safe to say I didn't like her in the first movie, and I liked her even less as the lead in this.

Highlights were Winston Duke as M'Baku, Danai Gurira as Okoye, Michaela Cole as Aneka and Dominique Thorne as Ri-Ri Williams. 

I genuinely think Okoye should have become the Black Panther after she was stopped of rank.

There were a few glaring problems, such as the ""AI"" scene and no mention of what happened to Talokan or it's people during the ""blip"". Namor wants the surface world to burn, but it was the surface world that returned half his people with no help from him.

Overall a solid 6 out of 10, plot wise. The tributes to Chadwick Boseman were well done and a touching tribute.",2022-11-12 17:40:00
"To me, this didn’t feel like a proper Marvel film. It was ‘Avatar, featuring Marvel.’ It felt like seeing James Cameron’s film from the point of view of the anti-heroes.

Oh, and I also thought it was ‘Free Willy 3.5’ with Shamu’s cameo in the fight scenes.",2022-11-11 10:19:23
"Overall, a very good film. My wife said to me at the end of the first act that it was depressing, but I feel like it needed a somber tone to set up that finale. Strip away all the explosions and this is a movie about faith (in a way, similar to Love and Thunder). Shuri represents youth - when you're young and aspiring, you think you're so smart and all the talk of the ancestral plane and the wisdom of the elders and her brothers spirit being with them is nonsense, scientifically impossible. As you age a bit, get some wisdom and experience, that's when you can realize that sometimes the science of traditions and faith aren't as important, and sometimes you really do feel your loved one rocking you gently. MBaku as well, devoted as he is to his gorilla God, he ages into a wise elder, and his faith in his people and his ancestors is strong. The Atlanteans too are strong in their faith - Namor is their feathered God and protector and ultimately he sets them up to win the war by ensuring Wakanda will rely on them in the future. All of that pays off in the final moments with Shuri on that beach, she doesn't abandon science, but realizes it can coexist with faith.

Seeing MBaku take a more subtle advisor role, while not visually thrilling, was great growth for him. He had been one of my favorites from the first movie, and his growth to not only trust but love and lead the other tribes was satisfying. He was comic relief at times (and used to show the strength of Namor during the flooding of Wakanda), but he had the wisest words of any of the elders in wanting to not give in to Namor. Ultimately, he's proven right as Namors goal after their battle is to do exactly what MBaku warned of- he will want more.

The return of Killmonger was handled decently, but very understated to the point that some may have missed the point. Shuri was so certain that it had failed because that WAS the ancestral plane to her. For Tchalla, his was on an open savanna, his father clad in a robe, giving sage loving advisement. For Killmonger, his was in that apartment, being worked up by his father. For Shuri, at the time her faith was weak. Killmonger was her doubt, in the mumbo jumbo, in herself, in her motivations. The ancestral plane gave her what she needed as a warning to not be Killmonger, to not let vengeance win.

My last point is a bit tongue in cheek, but I felt like Tchallas son was weirdly named. Wouldn't it be Tchama instead if Tchalla Jr? Seems from Tchalla and Killmonger that the naming convention is to take the fathers named and change the last consonant. Just feels like Marvel is trying to set up to have Tchalla still be in the MCU through a quiet recast.",2022-11-11 13:40:21
"Probably going to get shit on for this: but did anyone else think the mid-credit scene was useless and nothing but pandering?

Black Panther has a kid, great. He's too young to show up in any movies minus a time jump, and it didn't set up the next phase of the MCU at all. That's also ignoring the question of wtf did Black Panther have sex lol",2022-11-11 14:07:36

"This feels like the first Marvel movie in a while that was taken seriously and it was so refreshing. No corny jokes, no “he’s right behind me isn’t he”, a villain with some depth and serious strength, everything was done with great pacing and weight. I will say Iron Hearts inclusion definitely felt pushed by Kevin, but other than her character, this is hands down a Top 10 Marvel movie.",2022-11-15 14:39:36
"The movie was ok for a little bit but shit overall. I wanted to see a superhero movie, but instead I was force-fed some bullshit evil “aquaman and hermes had a child” rip off with hardly legible plot line that lacked any meaningful resolution or relation to the larger marvel universe. 

Also, fuck them for making us think we were gonna see Black Panther two. I’ve realized half way through why the film is called “Wakanda forever”…..because it goes on forever about wakanda and not at all about Black Panther. 

This movie was better than Eternals, Black Widow and She Hulk. But worse than everything else they made. The bar was set so high, but the movie hardly beat the worst movies on Marvel’s track record. 

Movies I would rather have watched than this include such flops as: Green Lantern, Birds of Prey, Suicide Squad 1 and 2, Justice league (original edit) or the worst Siendfield episode on repeat for 2.5 hours.",2022-11-17 01:00:34
"Namor jumping through the air reminded me of Sanji lol. Sneak peak of the One Piece live action.

Namor was fantastic and had some amazing moments.

And echoing others here, yeah the blue suit was awful.

I get the ultimate goal was to get Namor, but man fighting the fish people in the ocean on a boat was so dumb.

Fight scenes left a lot to be desired.

Editing was really bad at times with scenes cutting way too hard.

Overall, it was ok... yeah they should've recast T'Challa. The movie broadly would've still worked.",2022-11-11 04:01:35

Please fast forward to whatever movie has Wakanda and the Talokan team up because LAWD that alliance (however short-lived) will be a sight to behold.,2022-11-11 17:46:17
"So I have two main beefs with this film.  The first is why we’re none of the avengers at Tchallas funeral?!?  Especially Bucky, he’s the white wolf and lived in Wakanda.  Tchalla fought along side these guys in the biggest battle ever, yet none of them show up?  

The second is he had a kid….he had a kid and no one but three people knew he existed!!!!  Not even Shuri?  He’s the king of wakanda and no one knew the king had a freaking son?  Not even his own sister???  He was old enough that Tchalla knew him and told them not to go to the funeral?!?  Sorry that’s just ugh, I can’t with that.",2022-11-12 01:42:18
There was a group of ladies in front of us at the movies who was talking loudly threw the ENTIRE movie. All 3 hours. Ended up telling a manager who gave us free tickets but that was unbelievable. It’s like they thought they were at home watching tv or some shit.,2022-11-12 04:40:21
"The opening scene was super jarring with the panic as T'Chalas heart rate dropped for a character just off screen that we as the audience know is doomed. And it was very sudden and painful and strange and surreal like Chadwick's death was I think for a number of people. 


Honestly though while it had many good moments overall I felt like this movie needed editing both in terms of scenes and script. The first Black Panther also raised the bar for wardrobe and costume. Some of the suits here... Why God? To be like toys to sell? Some really weird choices. All of the CIA scenes needed to be gone too.",2022-11-13 08:33:49
"The suits they made for Okoye and the Ironheart suit looked like something straight out of the CW, truly hideous and poorly done.",2022-11-13 22:41:31
"Super average and lacked the style of the first one 

-	beaming up the coffin looked goofy, they should’ve went with a traditional burial
-	bunch of ugly looking mech suits (ironheart’s included)
-	Martin freeman for no reason
-	namor showing the beauty of his kingdom and people and then revealing he wants to wage war on innocent nations
-	namor only having the upper hand when he can fly? like how many other characters?
-	namor beat by shuri without any training whatsoever 
-	namor and black panther come from plants
-	shuri jumping over namor when he ducked looked unintentionally hilarious 
-	entire climax fight was unexciting and awkwardly staged on a weird ship
-	“wakanda forever!” By the 10 wakandans left alive on the ship lol
-	okoye’s mask coming off for her to say a one-liner and then immediately covering her face again before she attacked
-	shuri looked super unconvincing as a skinny black panther
-	end credits scene: hey shuri, this is your replacement",2022-11-13 23:46:16

"There is a good movie trying to crawl its way out of the dirt but it’s repeatedly beaten down by a shovel and kept from coming back alive. Horrendous visual and audio effects. A decent villain , origin story and theme kept the film passable. Good acting for a marvel film. Also it’s fun to try and guess which background actors Letitia Wright was showing anti vax YouTube videos to on set.",2022-11-26 03:19:33

"Much better movie than the first. Wakanda felt more like a place here rather than a concept. 

Side characters always a treat with Okoye being my favorite. (Her new costume suuuuuuuuuck)

Movie was waaaaaay to long. I don't know what I would cut but dang felt like 3 hours. 

The actresses for Shuri and the Queen were phenomenal in this movie, Shuri had such a cool arc and I like her build. She makes for an interesting black Panther. One who you would think would be silly and gadget focus but was rather vengeful and vicious. 

I like Riri Williams to, not a stand out by any means but I look forward to see her iron man armor in a movie in the future. 

Also they pick the cutest fucking child for Tchalla junior, my goodness was he adorable. 

Another negative would be Namor, the character was cool but the actor did nothing for me. Could he replaced with anyone and it would had left the same impression.",2022-11-13 01:26:11
"Why did namor want to kill the scientist? She already created the machine. ( or others used her design). Killing her solves nothing. They can destroy the machine but they will just duplicate the way to detect vibranium.

Loved the film but goddamn the cgi on the new suits was terrible.,2022-11-11 04:38:52
"I think it’s ok, considering the loss of Chadwick, this was good. But nothing holds up comparing to the original BP. Everything, from the main character, the villain, the story, the action and even the music is a let down from the original. 

The two biggest disappointment is the actress portraying shuri, she was scene stealing and lights up the screen in the original BP, but she just can’t carry the title role. The big villain is forgettable. It’s understandable that the  killmonger was going to be one of the absolute best, but Nemor was just boring and feels like a token villain.

I also have problem with why they barely used the black panther theme music. It was so inspiring and so awesome. 

Overall, good enough, but disappointed given the anticipation.",2022-11-11 06:08:13

"I really enjoyed the movie, on the high end of Phase 4 content.

I’d be interested to see what the original draft of the movie was vs. this final product. You can feel how they used a lot of the first version of the film but then tried to fill in the missing T’Challa spots. 

I still think the extreme reaction against recasting was blown out of proportion. Shuri had a sick fighting style and suit, and I’m assuming 10 years from now T’Challa Jr will be BP?

I assumed after Secret Wars we would be getting essentially a universe reset, with major players being recast, but this movie seemed like it’s laying groundwork for the future.",2022-11-11 14:32:12

Easily one of my favorite MCU movies and it's mostly because of Namor.,2022-11-11 23:49:15
"One thing I appreciated is that it didn't take the MCU route of having some cheesy self-aware comment about Namor's feet wings looking silly. They did look silly, but the movie takes them seriously and it makes him a more compelling villain because of it (and of course adds weight to a wing being ripped off).",2022-11-12 02:54:28
"Good movie. Well-directed and great action.

Few things : 

1) Wakanda is in East Africa, no? And Namor's people were in Mexico? You're telling me they were casually traveling over thousands of miles of ocean and then thousands of miles of land to get to East Africa? Lol

2) So Ramonda knew Nakia had her grandson...but recruited her to go on a dangerous mission to rescue Shuri?? 

3) Did TChalla not go through Shuri's arc in Captain America 3?",2022-11-12 03:09:33
Something tells me they're going to change Namor from being God tier horny for Sue Storm and navigate that over to him lusting for Shuri. Because I think having a Latino/Indigenous man lusting rather creepily over white women isn't going to fly. Hell it was weird in the comics when he was a white guy lol,2022-11-12 05:23:52
"Regarding no one knowing about his son, no Black Panther wouldn't have kept it secret....I think they wanted us to think about how Chadwick kept his illness from everyone. He was an extremely private person and I do think there are still feelings among many as to why he didn't want to tell them. Shuri also mentioned that her brother kept his illness from her. To not be allowed to say what you want to say to someone knowing their time is limited, you can tell that the cast was still processing the why and of course the loss.",2022-11-12 12:27:26

Is M’Baku now the new king of Wakanda? That last scene with him showing up to challenge for the throne left me a little confused. Only because it seems Shuri is going to live in Haiti now so maybe she’s temporarily giving up the throne? But that doesn’t seem like what her mother or T’Challa would have wanted for her.,2022-11-17 08:40:37
"Just watched Black Panther Wakanda Forever. For me it is easily one of the best MCU movies of Phase 4. I really enjoyed it. 

The movie has so many strengths, the acting, the direction, the tribute to Chadwick Boseman, Namor. Everyone was on their A-game in this movie. Loved especially Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett’s performance. One of the most surprising things about the movie was Shuri’s arc. For me she was the weakest part of the first Black Panther movie. But in this movie she truly earned the title of Black Panther. No one can truly replace Chadwick, but Letitia did a great job. 

The best part of the movie was Namor and Talokan. Loved what Ryan Coogler did with them. He’s so good at creating unique kingdoms, and using inspirations from different cultures to make them. Namor was so good in this movie. Loved seeing his fight scenes. Easily the best new addition in Phase 4 imo. Tenoch Huerta did such a good job. I need to see more of him playing Namor. His supporting cast was really good too. 

My only negatives of this movie was sometimes the pacing and Iron Heart. I understand why the movie’s runtime was so long, and I think it earned it. But some scenes really dragged and others went way too fast imo. And Iron Heart was completely unneeded. Remove her from the movie, and nothing would be missing. I think the actor did okay, but her character was so bland. The character feel like an afterthought for me. Maybe it is because her role was exactly the same as America Chavez in DS2. Hopefully the character is better in her own show. 

I would give the movie an 8/10.",2022-11-19 18:02:27
Cmon that movie was pretty weak. So much unnecessary filler. Namor and his people were really cool though,2022-11-25 07:58:01

This is the first marvel movie in a long time I genuinely enjoyed and had no critiques for coming out of the theater. Others I'd know immediately something was off ever since the start of phase 4. Easily one of the best marvel movies of all time. You really have to dislike the comic franchise or nitpick to dislike this movie.,2022-12-06 03:43:11
"Man that movie was so long...it just didnt want to end and it was so boring to boot.  Shuri black panther sucked. You remember back in the days when games had big head cheat codes? Someone activated that for shuri. It looked so terrible.

The first one was already pretty bad but this  one feels like it could have been better but in the end just wasnt.

I somewhat like namor and his first action scene in the city was the only good part in this movie buteverything else especially the wakanda stuff was ehh.4/10 for me. waste of time. Not even a good after credit scene to set some other movie up.",2023-02-04 11:16:25

"This movie should have been cancelled after the sudden death of Chadwick. It was terrible without him. No emotion just jumping scene to scene and complete lack of substance. Namor was ok but didn’t like the look of the actor, he just didn’t seem fit enough to be a god. The costume design was something a elementary kid could draw up. Why is Elaine Bennis in so many things now, did she lose all her money somehow? 

Anyways it’s probably too late but if you’re thinking about watching this or paused after 15 minutes then I would suggest you just stop and pretend it doesn’t exist.",2023-02-08 16:27:34

"I was so excited to finally see some kick ass representation for my people when K'uk'ulkan and the rest of his group came out! Then quickly went to ""oh I'm gonna be pissed if they make them the bad guys."" But in the end, I was very pleased with the direction they went. They made it so there was no bad guy between the 2 civilizations ( the bad guys were colonizers trying to exploit them and their people), they made a point to show that they were both still strong and powerful by giving each side their wins here and there/not having one completely stomp out the other, they showed his motives and let the audience see that his intentions were good even if his method wasn't completely agreeable, and I LOVED that they showed the similarities between the two cultures ( imo mirroring irl with how there are actually alot of similarities in Black culture & Latino Culture, especially going to our indigenous parts of the culture and how we get pitted against eavhother often when really we have a similar goal/desire for our people, and that we work better together ) and how they came together in the end just tied it all in real nice and satisfyingly. I sympathized with both sides and didn't find either in the wrong. So excited to finally see some indigenous-Latino representation! Some fucking Latino representation in general without being the comedic side character or villain. He was more of an Anti-hero, which is how he is in the comics apparently. And I love me an Anti-hero.",2022-11-13 04:39:16
"My only gripes are 

1. The way they beamed T’Challa’s body after his funeral seemed odd and not a tradition I would expect from Wakanda.

2. I felt the crowning scene at the end was rushed. So is M’baku king now? Maybe I’m just an idiot but I was lost

Other than that 9.8/10 movie. I cried more times than I can count!

ETA:

3. Did they HAVE to kill Queen Ramonda? I felt like they were laying it on thick at this point",2022-11-11 03:40:36
I really did not like the end credit scene… it felt like it cheapened the entire movie and the death of T’Challa. Other than that I thought movie was great,2022-11-11 03:37:01
Anything in this film you find cringey???,2022-11-11 03:43:53
Namor was good but I disliked the ending. They made him weak and lost to Shuri?  The guy that can solo the Hulk?  Honestly I think they should have let him win and destroy Wakanda. That would be more interesting in my opinion.,2022-11-11 13:05:26
"This movie hits some emotional high points that I genuinely didn't think the MCU would ever hit again after Endgame. That Marvel Studios logo gave me chills. The ending is also incredibly moving.

In between the film is a really messy experience. I liked Riri fine, and I always enjoy seeing Ross, but you could have easily done the same main story of the Wakanda/Namor conflict without either of those characters, which just end up bloating the running time. I especially found the JLD scenes incredibly intrusive.

Great performances by Bassett and Gurira in particular. I liked Namor a lot. Wright is an appealing actress, and I really liked her in the first BP, but I don't think she is up to some of the dramatic heavy lifting that this film asks of her. I especially don't think the part with the Killmonger cameo and hinting at this dark side of Shuri worked at all.

Overall I'd still give it a 7.5. Coogler and Co. had a hell of a tough job on this film and mostly delivered a good film and nailed the Boseman tribute.",2022-11-11 17:34:22
"Tenoch, Angela Bassett, danai, etc were all great, but I do think Letitia stole the show and surprised me. She had to act with everyone and really display her range - grief, rage, doubt, self assurance, growth, etc. Especially loved her scenes with Michael b Jordan and when she tells mbaku what she wants to do",2022-11-12 11:28:22
i’m sorry but to me personally this movie was not it. They def should’ve made usman or ngannou the black panther and they made the wakanda army so small when supposedly they are from this huge city. The first black panther was so much better.,2022-11-26 03:06:42
"This has some pretty mighty big shoes to fill with the behemoth that was the original Black Panther, and obviously even more so following the real-life passing of Chadwick Boseman. For me, personally, I feel that this is a surprisingly stronger outing that the first film, with higher stakes, better acting, better special effects, some more great cinematography, memorable set-pieces, and another great score from Ludwig! 

Somehow, they managed to work in the death of T’Challa in a tasteful way that managed to pay tribute to the real life man behind the character for what will likely always be the most devastating, heartbreaking opening sequence to an MCU film. 

I look forward to the return of Namor, as I felt Coogler and Tenoch knocked it out of the park in debuting the character and showing audiences with the Sub Mariner is all about. Seeing those ankle wings in action was so goofy and delightfully fun, especially when juxtaposed against the violence and destruction Namor is seen to be capable of. Also can we talk about the designs for Attuma & Namora? Absolutely sick.

Admittedly, I wasn’t expecting Okoye to play such an integral role here, but thought her character development and overall usage was a nice addition (even if I’m not sold on the Midnight Angels suits). It seems an issue some are taking with the film is Riri Williams, but I actually thought she fit in well, and with a movie that sees Shuri dealing with so much, and I mean so, so much trauma, it’s nice to see two young, smart, ridiculously talented young people getting to find friendship with one another as Riri & Shuri do. Hopefully we get more of them together in the future… cough cough Young Avengers cough cough. The other issue seems to be the inclusion of Ross & Valentina, but like, Everett has been tied to Wakanda since Captain America: Civil War and Valentina is one of the figurehead characters being established in Phase 4. I can’t really see them taking away from enjoyment here, especially Ross, but I guess mileage will vary. 

The Elephant in the Room: Letitia Wright! Problematic as she may be, the film relies on her to carry a lot of the emotional weight and for those unaware, she’s a reaaaaaaally talented actress. Without her in the role of Shuri, I simply don’t think Wakanda Forever works. She may not be the hero fans want (rightfully so), but it would be ignorant to act like she didn’t deliver one of the best lead performances in a Marvel movie here.

TLDR: it’s great, I liked it more than the original, Shuri & Namor are fantastic leads, the score is great, the cinematography is great, a few very memorable set-pieces, continued great world-building with Wakanda and Talokan. 

**also loved the Killmonger surprise, AND the fact that it played into Shuri’s story and wasn’t just “hey here’s a cameo”. Thought they handled it really well tbh and loved that her suit had the gold trim of his suit in the first movie, showing that her personality is now more of a mix of T’Challa & Killmonger**

Edit: thanks for the downvotes for loving the movie, I guess.",2022-11-11 18:46:42
"I cried 3 times. At the beginning when they did the marvel opening with just Chadwick/T'Challa and the whole funeral, when Ramonda died, and at the end with the post credits scene. This movie was beautiful. It touched on so many things I can't even begin to express.",2022-11-13 01:14:38
I like when Shuri did the shoulder pat thing and said Wakanda Forever (that's the name of the movie!) before blasting Namor with her ships afterburner.,2022-11-11 18:27:43
"Given the impossible task Coogler had to deal with, I think this movie was solid. Everything that related to Chadwick Boseman’s passing was handled in the best possible way. Namor is a great addition to the MCU and I can’t wait to see more of him.

Ironheart was okay. Did she add anything to the movie other than as a plot device? Sure, she was in the final fight, but I don’t think she really did anything pivotal in it. Hopefully she’ll be more interesting in her series.

Ultimately I was really missing Boseman’s presence in this movie. His portrayal of T’Challa made for such a great leader and screen presence that was on par with Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Letitia Wright’s opinions aside, I don’t think she has the screen presence to lead the movie, and her Shuri just isn’t the sort of character that fits as a leader or warrior.

Also, was it just me or was most of the action just shot poorly? The camera was just way too shaky which made me a little nauseous. It’s been a while since I rewatched the first Black Panther, but I remember it having some really solid action in it - plus Creed’s fights were shot well. Maybe the 2nd unit took over the action more this time around…?

All in all, I think it served well as a tribute to Boseman, but there was no way it could make up for his loss.

Also as a little side note: I think this is the first Ryan Coogler movie that doesn’t have a tie to Oakland. I was expecting Riri to be from there or something like that.",2022-11-11 03:45:40
"While Angela Bassett and all the actors playing Wakandans definitely brought their A game with performances, I gotta say I was really impressed with Tenoch Huerta as Namor. He had such a commanding presence and was a total badass.",2022-11-11 04:00:30
"It was fine...

It’s a basic Marvel superhero film with great action and good special effects. The original Black Panther was enjoyable and Chadwick Boseman’s performance was great. Here, despite his departure, the film was still watchable and had some good moments. The characters were alright while some were a little annoying. I do like the costume designs (besides one awful suit) and all the performances were good as they weren’t a terrible performance throughout. But honestly it felt like any cash grab from the previous film like most unnecessary sequels made nowadays. Watchable but really eh.

"#Did anyone else have this experience of an nearly empty theatre??

I went to see this at 7PM opening day (tonight). There were 13 other people in the theatre. Total of 17 including me. 

It's a Marvel premier, I expected it to be packed. I live a little North of Atlanta so I was expecting it to be PACKED. For anyone who isn't familiar with the US, Atlanta is the Black capital of the US. The city and metro are 50% Black and the whole Atlanta metro (where I live) is like a modern Black Wall Street where there is a ton of money and success in the community that other states dont have. 

I was SHOCKED that there wasn't more people in the theatre for a Marvel movie premier for a Black movie in Atlanta Metro. 

I enjoyed the movie a lot. I wouldn't watch it again but that's how I feel about all Marvel, I've been burnt out on these movies and only sporadically follow them, but never watch them twice.

When Namor was a boy and returned to his land to bury his mother, he witnessed the Spanish colonizers enslaving his people and was ""horrified"" by this in the movie to the point that he killed the Europeans and saved his people.  But historically the Aztecs practiced extensive slavery that was just as brutal if not more so since many slaves were used in ritual sacrifices and tortuous procedures in order to appease their gods.  They would literally behead slaves, use their heads as balls, throw them down their pyramids, and run thorned vines through their lips for blood sacrifices.  The sight of Spanish slavery would not have been alarming to him or his people at all since it had been a part of their culture for a very long time.

But the CIA subplot and everything related to the government after the first 20 minutes or so felt a bit unnecessary, especially Val's character. She really didn't add anything, and her tapping into the pearls was super stupid. Riri wasn't all that interesting, she felt more like a plot device than a character, but she was better than America in DS2.

It's still good, and a lot of the other good stuff outweigh the bad, but it is not among the best of the MCU

Maybe suck is a bit harsh as I don't know how to scale them but this phase isn't grabbing me at all the the first avengers saga.

Maybe it's all the political correctness I don't know. I don't think that's it. But it makes me wonder if a other people male or female would have been better.

I'm still along for the ride till the day I die as I'm very invested but if the rumor I heard of coming in antman quantummania, is true and Scott dies and his daughter takes over I'm not sure what I'll think. In February we shall see lol",2022-11-15 01:16:35
">!Having his son being T'Challa opens things up for Storm. Which is great.!<

Tenoch Huerta is so fucking good. Oh my god his ass looked amazing, almost always.

Letitia Wright put an incredible performance into this. She really nailed it.

Angela Bassett was by far the star of the show. >! And her dying is really crappy but keeps up the tradition of awesome Moms dying... (Frigga) !<",2022-11-11 05:11:19
"And T’Challa’s body was brought back to his home planet…seriously. Why have his body beamed up into that ship?

Also, while I feel for Chadwick Boseman and T’Challa, I felt bad Shuri was only thinking about her brother when she’s supposed to be getting over her mother’s death. Angela Bassett should’ve been given something more, even if she reached out to Shuri at the climax.",2022-11-11 07:38:50

"Just came back from theaters, and I have to say I enjoyed it overall. Could easily cut 20 mins of this movie(especially Thunderbolts/Ross part). Namor was fantastic, can't wait to see him in the future. 

Ironheart wasn't bad, but she's no Tony Stark. Loved the story about grief, soundtrack was fire and cinematography was lit.",2022-11-11 20:01:15

"I liked it.

Namor was absolutely gorgeous.

When Queen Ramonda asked about the vibranium, and Shuri said, look at him, I reimagined it:

Ramonda:  How do you know about vibranium?

Shuri: Momma, look, he's dripping in it.

I also really liked the mile high Rock Bottom he did on her at the end of the movie.",2022-11-13 03:37:13

"This movie has to do a lot; adding Iron Heart felt like a straw that broke the camel's back. I understand she is a plot driver and the lighter side of the movie. However, it feels like it limps along. 

With that being said, the Namor introduction was phenomenal, Tenoch was maybe one of my favorite performances, and the respect it gives to Chadwick Boseman is incredibly admirable. I also appreciated the containment of this being tied to two worlds without any other movies creeping in. 

Again, it has to do a lot and also service fans, both new and old.

Lastly, more Winston Duke in any Marvel movie. He was doing work in this.",2022-11-15 01:21:53
"It would be cooler to see Okoye, nokia or mbaku be the black panther imo. Letita Wright acted well, but shuri isn't that interesting as the main character for the future. Adding killmonger was a nice touch",2022-11-15 15:19:48

"Didn't know what to expect for the movie, but black panther vs mr. Nimbus and the Navi was not on my list.",2022-11-20 12:06:54
"I didn't really like Namor. They made him into a vengeful psycho akin to Killmonger but at least Killmonger tasted oppression and his dad was murdered by the Wakandan Royals.

Namor was a God from birth, he was never oppressed or mistreated. He was raised as a Messiah. So why is he so radicalised? He murdered the Queen just to be a dick and there's no redemption for that.

Shuri sparing him is fine and in character but I feel like they were too chill at the end.

Namor being taken down by dehydration and a newbie Panther was also pretty laughable. They said he's on the same level as Thor but even Iron Man circa Civil War would/should be able to beat the piss out of a Super Soldier. Can you imagine Thor losing to Cap? He should oneshot him.

The only thing I REALLY liked was the Chadwick tribute ( nearly teared up, would've straight up cried if I was watching at home ) and the Killmonger scene. That one I absolutely loved. I didn't expect Michael B Jordan to be back, and it was my desire for them to pull multiverse crap and make him the new Panther. But it was good to have him back, and to see him double down on his ideology.

The best villains are those who truly believe in their point of view.",2022-11-21 23:55:16
"Critics have commended the performances of returning cast members such as Boseman, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and Angela Bassett, as well as new additions including actress Tenoch Huerta and actor Winston Duke.

"Just watched. I don’t have a bunch to say. 
I felt disconnected from Shuri. Namor was such a good character, wasted in bad editing and writing. His motivation was not clear and he was wishy washy. The movie felt so disjointed and really lacked in a good story. 

Visually it was amazing. 
Underwater city was terrible looking. 
The Score was phenomenal.",2023-02-08 05:22:28
I was worried about Letitia Wright and her ability to carry a movie as an actress.  This movie proved me wrong.  Angela Basset will get nominated for best supporting actress.,2022-11-12 04:44:32
"Okay, the movie was okay. The plot was murky, I still can’t understand why Namor wanted to cause trouble with Wakanda. I found the ending a little weak even though I thought the mid credits scene was nice. Everett Ross had such a small role and I wanted to see more involvement from JLD as the FBI director. Man, those fight scenes were weak and too long. Riri was a wasted character, both good and bad. The soundtrack was great. This film is a testament to my belief that the “Marvel formula” is lacking. Good costume design. As someone who wanted a Black Panther sequel, this met my expectations. As someone who wanted a good film, it failed at meeting my expectations. 6.4/10",2022-11-11 03:31:31
"It was very obvious that Namor has never sent his people to war. The second that ship appeared in the water, the Talokan should have had the advantage. There was no reason for them to ever scale the side of the ship. The mass bomb attack should have been the first move followed by opening more holes in the bottom of that ship for it to sink. I don't see how you can fight The Talokan in open water and not lose your entire army. Even with a sneak attack. The Wakandans should have waited for them to get to the surface at Wakanda where they would have been at a disadvantage.

Other than that, I enjoyed it. I like that they didn't kill Namor or his lieutenants. Definitely liked it more than the first Black Panther movie.",2022-11-11 04:52:26
"Okoye should have been Black Panther. She had, by far, the best fight scenes in the movie. That said, it makes sense why, out of everyone, it had to be Shuri. 

Letitia Wright handles the dramatic scenes the best. It's where she shines. But as Black Panther, and maybe it was on purpose, she never felt permanent because she's driven a lot more by hate and revenge. She even refuses to be Queen of Wakanda, rather choosing to just be BP. What struck me was that it implies Shuri might turn evil and even possibly become a future nemesis for the next BP. 

Lupita Nyong'o's screen time is okay but it felt like she didn't do much in the movie besides be a voice of reason. We only get one shot of her fighting with her bracelets and that''s it, I wish we got more of the ass kicking Nakia of the first movie. 

M'Baku is a scene stealer but he was barely in the movie. So dumb to bring back a fan favorite and just have him show up for 5 minutes to throw the funniest lines. 

Riri Williams sucked ass. Unfunny and annoying and Ironheart looks terrible. This didn't make me excited to watch IRONHEART. 

Queen Raimunda was the MVP when it came to acting. She has one scene in the movie that should guarantee a Oscar nom for Angela Bassett. 

CGI was TERRIBLE but it's the same old for the MCU. I have no idea how these movies are so expensive yet have such lousy FX.",2022-11-11 09:54:26

"I braced myself for emotional moments in the movie, but it was so heartbreaking even after preparing myself. I felt that the actors' grieving T'Challa's death was that much more searing because we know that it is not just the death of a character but also the actor who played the character. Rest in peace, Chadwick Boseman.",2022-11-11 10:49:18
How am I supposed to wash the popcorn bucket?,2022-11-11 14:18:17
"I know Shuri was royalty, but couldn't we have chosen anyone else to take up the mantle?

Killmonger from an alternate universe. Okoye, one of the best warriors in all of the MCU. M'Baku, just because I love him and think he's the best part of both movies.

It's a comic book movie, it shouldn't be hard to write in a reason why someone with charisma is the Black Panther now.",2022-11-11 15:28:48
"Just finished watching the movie. Namor and talokan were super cool. The involvement of whale and orca were cool too.

 But I dont like the main character. It seems that  all her assisants look super strong but she look so thin and weak. And wtf with that dialog with riri at school, riri said they dont accept my paper because im black?? What ??",2022-11-11 15:37:53
Man I went this movie with huge Marvel fatigue from this Phase 4. Walked out with a  mother fucking hype train ticket for future stuff choo choo. 10/10 for me. Namor was mwah,2022-11-12 01:33:29
This movie is darker than DC's.,2022-11-12 07:07:05

I really enjoyed it.  It wasn’t perfect but I actually liked this movie more than the original Black Panther.   Both Killmonger and Namor were better villains than the average Marvel movie.,2022-11-12 16:37:22

"I feel like we've gotten to the point in this fandom where it's easy to nitpick the little things, but in a surprising breath of fresh air, I think this movie was genuinely great and could stand on its own without the marvel nametag as a story. Dialogue was great, acting was better, it was a bit long but the pacing was still good. Fight scenes were pretty dope. The character arcs were also excellent as well, and everything more or less made sense. They succeeded at what I feared they would fail at, which was turning Shuri into a serious character. The raw emotion she displays in this movie and her genuine tilt towards the 'dark side' after her talk with Killmonger was great to watch. And she's still pretty funny when she wants to be. Definitely looking forward to see how she continues to develop in the next movies now that we're past the death in the family thing.",2022-11-14 05:44:53
There were standout performances but it was not a strong plot and the third act fell apart very quickly. Also the repeated calling of Ross a colonizer and giving him an unusual female boss without context? made the movie veer into Wokeanda Forever territory.,2022-11-20 00:54:30

"I liked the movie and had a great time at the theater.

A few thoughts:

* Amazing to see a mostly female look and feel so natural on the big screen. Let’s be honest, we’re not used to this, and when this happens it tends to feel forced. They really nailed having a bunch of incredible characters who all happened to be women. Hats of.

* Also very cool how the message through Riri and Shuri was essentially “work and study hard, and you can achieve amazing things”. Now that’s quite the message to send to kids!

* They really put the *forever* in **Wakanda Forever**. Nearly three hours?! It felt like it could have been about two hours long and packed a stronger punch throughout.

I look forward to Ironheart for sure. And the Quantumania trailer on the big screen was also something!!!",2022-11-14 09:25:15
"Movie really need 45 minutes trimmed up. Way too long and got boring. First time movie actually felt long.

&#x200B;

Something was off on the CGI with namor.....wrong light or something. It started looking cartoonish.

&#x200B;

Movie was 4 out of 10 for me.....sub average. If it didn't have the marvel name no reason to go. Just content. nothing offensive just getting boring and shlocky

&#x200B;

Weakest MCU of the year...Just content.",2022-11-13 20:31:18
"When Namor called himself a mutant, I gasped. 

So so ready to have the X-men in the MCU.",2022-11-14 07:14:21
"Shuri actress did great, props to her and the Queen for carrying the film as main characters. Namor was great but the whole conflict was so contrived. Riri and Elaine from Seinfeld were both lame characters and those blue suits at the end were disgusting. Overall 8 out of 10, really enjoyed it, much more emotional/serious than most marvel slop",2022-11-15 07:15:31
"I liked it but it could’ve been better. I thought Letitia Wright and Angela Basset did a great job. Dominique Thorne as Ironheart was great as well and now I’m totally invested in her upcoming Disney+ show.

I do think it’s one of the better entries in the MCU’s phase Four as a whole but as a sequel to Black Panther it’s not as good as the first.

The choice to not make Nakia the new Black Panther was very strange to me, this movie being overly long, having a weak side plot and a weak villain in Namor in my opinion hold it back from being as good as the first. I do appreciate what Ryan Coogler did here even if all of it didn’t completely click with me.

I think if Nakia was made the new Black Panther instead and Michael B Jordan was brought back as an anti hero going forward (this movie was lacking a strong male character) like with Loki this would’ve been a stronger film overall.",2022-11-14 13:11:36
"Never cared for the first black panther. Found it dull, over hyped and had some of the worst CGI I had seen in a recent blockbuster movie. I actually loved Wakanda Forever. I have always found the women of Wakanda to be much more interesting than T’Challa and I loved Namor. I went in with zero expectations and walked away extremely entertained. Top ten MCU movie for me.",2022-11-12 01:15:35

btw, when she first appearead in the suit in front of the M'baku, was that mustache shadow accidental or on purpose, due to what she was saying?

the scientist lady, Tony Stark-ish, did she just killed many cops on the bridge? felt kinda off

i really liked the actor of Namor tho, very good. (but if felt so random that they just gave a random guess that maybe without water he'll lose powers.. and then when fighting by the water, he could fly and didnt just in case dived for a sec to regain some strenght)

but I felt like I enjoy it more than the first one.",2022-11-11 21:53:31
Wow they had Poison Ivy/*What If* Black Widow in the MCU for 5 minutes and offed her,2022-11-12 03:11:01
"do you guys think that Shuri is an atheist? she didn't believe that the ancestral plane existed and when okoye talked about how the Bast stories were ingrained in her mind, Shuri talked about how that would sound very painful. seems to me that shuri doesn't believe in god and is likely an atheist/agnostic/deist.

overall pretty good movie. i'll put it behind No Way Home and Shang Chi for phase 4 movies. the main part i didn't like was the slow dialogue scenes with the underwater people and nakia. i also think that ironheart should've been one of those child prodigies that got into MIT at the age of 15 or something. she could pretty much ""one up"" shuri and say something like ""wakanda? bitch, i found a mountain full of vibranium with a box of scraps"" and then have a technological rivalry between the two over the years.",2022-11-13 21:14:08

They ask wakanda to help stay hidden and kill one person to feel safe. 

Wakanda says no and starts a war killing a lot more.

 The soundtrack is something to listen to at the theater. Especially the final fight. The effects and cinematography are all amazing to see come to life.

 The final fight and the action scenes are all done spectacularly along with being engaging.
 
 The performances from Angela, Tenoch, and Letitia help give heart to this movie.

 My only cons are the following:

 The opening scene was done way too quickly. We should've had more time spent on it before T'Challa was actually revealed to have died. Something like Shuri finding out about the disease and trying everything to cure it for months.

 The Ross/Val plot was a bit unnecessary and felt like something that would fit a post credits scene more.

 Doctor Doom potentially having been cut from the movie as a post credits scene is insane as this is the final movie in this phase of the MCU. Lake Bell's character meaning isn't ever explained because of this.",2022-11-14 04:44:03

"I went from liking the film on first viewing to really loving it on second viewing. Everything about it works so well I’m surprised to see so many people say they disliked it. It’s just as entertaining as the first but it’s even more emotional and personally the Shuri/Namor conflict works soooo much better than the T’Challa/Killmonger conflict, though I did like it in that movie, I just never felt it was that strong. I think us as the audience seeing Shuri and Namor connect when he’s showing her Talokan gives us a reason to kinda care about whether she’s gonna kill him or not at the end, whereas Killmonger I just got no sympathy for him even though I did see where he was coming from, he was just angry the whole movie and I didn’t get the same kind of layers to his character the way you do with Namor",2022-11-16 16:55:44
"I liked this more than the original. It resonated with me because I've felt tragic loss too. And Namor was so sick, one of my favorite MCU villains yet. 

Some things I continue to not like though.. like a black guy making monkey sound and beating his chest like a gorilla. How is that supposed to be empowering to black people? You don't have Africans acting like monkeys in Africa, why do they insist on making that a Wakamda thing? And calling white people colonizers when they had nothing to do with those events from hundreds of years ago and just living their lives is stupid. 

And how is Wakanda supposed to be the most powerful nation on earth based off what you see of them in this movie? Like how could they even defeat one branch of the U.S. military? Whatever. I hope to see more of Namor.",2022-11-18 22:39:21

"That was okay. Namor was cool, this Ironheart character was hit and miss. Shuri being the next BP was too predictable. Shocked by the Queen's death tbh. Mixed overall.",2022-11-11 03:40:45
Was there a post credit scene? Idk if I consider the kid scene post credit. Nothing after that,2022-11-11 03:52:30
"Film had some narrative issues. It's about 20 minutes too long and has less interesting stuff to say than the first. But, it's not bad especially when given the context of Boseman's death after the script was written. Difficult part is his absence is very noticeable. It's fine, not good, not bad.

Costumes besides black panther were mega ugly. Comic relief was kind of annoying and I think the film would have been better without her. Villain wasn't a throwaway but also wasn't incredibly interesting.

Performances were strong, but I don't think Wright has enough Charisma to take on the roll of Black Panther. Should have been Lupita, but she's too good of an actor to be wrapped up in a bunch of Marvel projects. 

I thought the thing that started the second act--the killing of the guards while rescuing Shuri--was actually a really lazy way to get the conflict rolling.

The conflict was kind of my main gripe with the film. It retouches on themes from the first regarding colonialism and imperialism, but they present Namor as a sympathetic villain, but kind of just make him bloodthirsty. The entire conflict of him wanting to kill the scientists girl could have been dealt with if he just talked to her when he captured her. The conflict was super lazy. 

It's fine.",2022-11-11 03:54:25
The movie did a lot great things. Tying Atlantis and Namor to Wakanda was very smart. Making their stories similar. Hard to imagine a better way to introduce Namor. But I don’t feel like we moved forward with this movie at all. And there wasn’t like a big hook that would have me talking about it for a week. It was idk meh. A decent marvel movie amongst 30 decent marvel movies,2022-11-11 03:59:46

I liked it. Hope it does well with the audience,2022-11-11 05:23:39
"I was genuinely scared of Namor and his soldiers. I really felt that they could have won, and probably would have if Shuri hadn’t had a change of heart. It’s been a while since I’ve felt that threat in an MCU movie",2022-11-11 06:15:09

"I’m happy the made it a more serious movie, unlike the parody Love and thunder! However it dragged forever and… for nothing in the end. It’s a good movie all around but quite indifferent IMO.

I’ll be skipping the next ones 🤷🤷",2022-11-11 08:27:46
"They handled the story of losing Chadwick well while also balancing Namor, him and his civilization were amazing to see. His fight scenes were badass too. The final act fight on the ship was kinda stupid/bland especially compared to earlier, although the showdown between Shuri and Namor was great

Agree with others in that the CIA subplot was unnecessary and ruined the pacing/length of the film, it could’ve ended after Shuri and Riri were captured.",2022-11-11 08:50:23
"A solid movie. Visually stunning, apart from cgi in the third act, music is absolutely amazing!, costumes top notch. The story is meh in a lot of points, repetitive, could've been shorter. All in all, a good popcorn flick.",2022-11-11 09:08:54

"I really enjoyed it. Namor rocks 

I keep seeing that the Talokans were way easier to root for but I disagree. think both the Talokans and Wakandans had reasons for their actions. Sure the Wakandans could’ve done a better job helping them but killing a 19 year old college student and letting Namor start a war with the suface world doesn’t exactly sound like the best course of action, not to mention Namor killed the Queen too. The Talokans were desperate to remain hidden at all costs but I think they could’ve talked it out more, they were making it way more complicated than it needed to be",2022-11-11 14:26:04
Man this movie was so much more emotionally driven than the first. I was legitimately tearing up at points haha. My whole theater was silent during the opening marvel title sequence. It was actually really cool to witness. The city of Talokan was absolutely amazing.

"Just finished it. 

LOVED it!

My only hope is we don’t have to wait too long before seeing Namor again!",2022-11-11 23:19:17
"The opening is great and the movie offers a thoughtful and respectful tribute to Chadwick that works in-universe too. I think some things could have been trimmed or made to flow better though. In the end it felt like some things took too long, some things lacked momentum or gravitas, others felt bloated. I don't think the CIA offered that much, and her becoming the BP felt rushed and more like an obligation than a natural flow of events to me. 

The action was really nice in some parts. The choreography and camera work of Okoye's fight w the water people was really well done, felt like it was actually shot on location and had real weight to all the strikes. So much better than a lot of comparable MCU action.

There were still some weird sets and obvious sky replacement things (something looked wrong about the crash site when he gets the beads), but a lot was shot outside on location and looked great. Especially when there was real water. Another thing that was refreshing against a lot of recent MCU",2022-11-12 02:40:20
Namor was so well done. Such a dick.,2022-11-12 02:40:43

This gives me Aquaman feeling,2022-11-12 13:33:57
"It was solid better part of Phase 5. The handling of the death I was not a fan of. I understand not recasting immediately but Tchalla having to die along with the actor is just plain depressing to me. I enjoy marvel for the escapist element and having to be reminded of Chadwick’s death in universe was really heart wrenching.

I think they could’ve set this movie in the 5 year gap of the snap and then be ready to have a new TChalla for BP3 further down the road when it’s more tenable to recast.

That being said I liked Shuri as BP, how they handled Namors powers and the settings of Wakanda and Tenochilan(although it was very dark in those scenes) do feel the conflict could’ve been avoided and was more a symptom of miscommunication which makes Ramondas death more tragic imo(Wasn’t a fan of that at all)",2022-11-12 20:51:38
Also the talocans have remained hidden for 500 years but Nakia is able to find their location easily and the move doesn't even bother to explain how she did it? Like come on,2022-11-12 22:56:34
So what happened to Lake Bell?  Was she a known character in the MCU prior to this?,2022-11-12 23:30:59
"Still miffed we didn't get to see Basset in the suit going ham. I get that she's not that kinda actress but her raw fury dicing up some goons would have been great to watch.

Shame we didn't get the final fight in a more interesting locale, the first 2/3rds were so visually great and the panther /namor fight was decent, but a big cgi punch-up on a boat felt lackluster when the rest looked so good.


Still a fun romp like a lot of phase 4 and I'm glad we are getting some silly Ness in it again (like namors whole design wouldn't have ever been greenlit a decade ago)",2022-11-13 01:00:18

"Hi, I have two questions:

1) On the bridge, what did Shuri say to Namor to save the life of Ironheart (Riri Williams)? I know Shuri agreed to be taken hostage by Namor, but I think she also said something else to convince Namor to spare Ironheart's life (I missed what she said).

2) Namor said to Shuri that Wakanda can only be an ally or an enemy. And he said that if Wakanda did not become an ally, then he would attack Wakanda.  But was there another reason that Namor insisted to Shuri that he would attack Wakanda? Was it because Wakanda held vibranium, or was it some other reason?",2022-11-22 14:54:43

"Probably the best MCU movie of the year!

- Cold opening was sudden and intense followed by the funeral scene with T'Challa presence felt throughout the movie. 
- Angela Bassett gives the best performance of the film. Wouldn't be surprised if she got a few acting nominations for it.
- First half of the movie is honestly great. Second half really drags.
- Tenoch Huerta as Namor was perfect. Exploration of the Talokans history and culture was my favourite part of the movie. Shout-out to Namora who did the most damage to Wakandans throughout the movie!
- Lupita N'yongo steals the movie as Nakia with the few scenes she had.
- Okoye and M'Baku had interesting character arcs in the movie.
- Last act was really poor. The fight in the middle of the ocean felt like a mid-movie battle rather than an end-movie battle and it felt really short too. 
- A lot of night scenes were too dark, especially Namor's introduction scene.
- VFX was an improvement over the previous MCU movies but still not polished in some scenes.
- Riri Williams was a poor character with no real arc. She was just a plot point and felt like 2hour backdoor pilot for her Disney+ series.
- Ludwig Göransson with another great musical score but the soundtrack felt flat.
- No one from Wakanda or Talokan offering a marriage proposal to unite the kingdoms felt off. Maybe it's the House of the Dragon fan in me but that's where my mind went to first when Namor gave Shuri his mom's necklace. 
- Lake Bell's character just disappeared. There were leaks that she would appear in the post-credits scene but maybe it was scrapped or shifted to Ironheart. B


A very touching and respectful goodbye to Chadwick Boseman. The movie itself was just good but it could have been better.",2022-11-11 16:34:41
"Yeah this movie wasn’t great but it was really good, a 7.5/10, if they were going for a black panther movie without black panther in it then they fucking nailed it because black panthers absence was felt! I think the worst thing about this movie is riri Williams and the best thing about the movie is the emotional scenes, when it’s serious it’s fucking amazing! But when it strays away from the seriousness the very few times that it does the jokes rarely land, that whole side plot with agent Ross was clearly meant to set up thunderbolts and I honestly don’t think it was needed",2022-11-11 03:13:26

"I know this subreddit hates everything Marvel but Im so surprised of all the mediocre reviews here

I thought this was easily their best film since Endgame, you could maybe argue NWH but that movie relies on so much nostalgia bait and the plot was ridiculous

This movie was so nuanced and mature and dark at times, it felt like the best of past phases when Marvel was more grounded and trying to appeal to more than just popcorn fodder

Also the world building of Talokan and Naymor was a great addition to the MCU. Loved all the parallels to Wakanda and how that tied into the themes and plot overall",2022-11-11 04:24:39

"Was it perfect? No. 

Did I love it? Yes. 

This feels like a return to form for Marvel in my eyes. Here’s some things I loved: 

- I felt the weight of T’Challa/Chadwick’s death the entire film. It was tasteful, heartbreaking, and critical to the story as well. I can’t imagine how difficult it was for Coogler and co to make this film after losing a close friend like that but so much respect to them. 

- Shuri was incredible. A character I have never enjoyed on screen until this film. She absolutely enthralled me from the opening moment. As someone who has grieved a lost one, I finally was able to relate to her on a deep level and I felt everything she felt 

- It looked beautiful. I could not think of a single moment where I thought to myself, “that looks rough” and I’ve felt that many a time in Stage 4. Finally a marvel movie was of the quality I expect from a huge studio like this. 

- It took itself seriously. Finally, a marvel movie that took itself seriously and didn’t use jokes to undercut every single emotional moment. The fact we got to sit in the grief and anger of the characters was such a breathe of fresh air after Thor and Doctor Strange. Was the movie slow at points? Sure. But I actually got to sit in these moments with the characters rather then be rushed through 20 min episodes on Disney+ or have a scene cut short from a joke. The comedy here was on point, I laughed at moments. But it didn’t take away from the emotion at all. 

I loved it and cannot wait for Ant Man 3 in a few months",2022-11-13 05:47:39

-Ramonda travels to Haiti and asks Nakia to retrieve Shuri from Namor.  

-Namor shows Shuri his home of Talocan City, and his origins, hoping that he can manipulate Shuri to usurp the Queen, and close Wakanda since the opening was the reason why T'Challa died. (They never stated how he died but is hinted)

-Shuri goes to Haiti and burns the funeral clothing which symbolizes the end of her griefing of T'Challa.  

-End

-Mid Credit Scene - Nakia introduces ~~Adonis~~, T'Challa Jr.

"Since this post is already being brigaded by trolls who are going to downvote everyone anyway, I’ll just come out and say it:

This was an excellent film for black girls in particular. Watching all the main characters with their diverse personalities was really enjoyable. I loved the banter between Okoye and Shuri, the burgeoning sisterhood between Shuri and Riri. The way Shuri rejects her mother’s traditions in the beginning and revists them at the end, a changed woman. The bridging of the gap between Shuri and Nakia and >!the fresh challenge of becoming to your nephew, what his father was to you.!<

All were incredibly relatable themes and experiences. And I loved watching all of these beautiful actresses interact on screen. It so incredibly rare to see a movie that lets black women steer the story and gives them the most screentime. *(And before you you say hurr durrgh you just got ""The Woman King!1""-- I don’t like historical fiction, I like urban fantasy/scifi!)* And this was an excellent urban fantasy/scifi.

There were definitely some weak writing choices, but I can easily overlook them. The costumes were gorgeous ~~(not talking about the Midnight Angel one obv)~~  the acting was off the charts. I thankfully didn’t get spoiled so I gasped when >!Killmonger!< appeared, and thought that was a great writing choice. I loved the immersion as well; really feeling the comfort of Wakanda as well as the recognizable yet unfamiliar world of Talokan.
 
If people think this movie is mid then that’s cool. I loved watching these incredible women of color for its entire runtime. And Namor was sexy as hell. What else could I truly ask for from not just a Marvel film, but any film in this day and age?",2022-11-11 05:44:32

And I was so excited to finally see Riri in the MCU as I’m a huge fan of her in the comics. She was honestly so funny and I’m excited to see more of her in her show.",2022-11-14 04:15:02
"RIP to Chadwick Boseman and King T’Challa, the loss of him hurts more than Gotham without Batman…I had high hopes for this movie, it wasn’t bad, but I think they had too many forced plots , characters (Riri Williams) and cheesy dialogue to really enjoy…saw a good video breakdown the good and the bad here:

"10/10 Hands down this was the best Marvel movie release in Phase 4. Shuri was great as the Panther and the jokes about the suit really had me laughing in the theater! Really had some engaging scenes like the underwater city and the origin story.

I think im going to go see this again on Saturday and take 4 of my friends with me it was just soooo amazing!",2022-11-11 20:40:18
"I am absolutely speechless. Somehow my fellow USC alum Ryan coogler managed to both respectfully send off Chadwick and also make an even better movie than the first. This was what the MCU needed desperately after a lacklustre first few phase 4 entries. 

The story is arguably the most mature and best we’ve seen in a marvel film since the raimi days. The themes of grief, acceptance and forgiveness were masterfully done. Shuuri sparing Namor reminded me of the whole “hate only begets more hate” spill you see in shonen anime, but it was well done. 

Riri williams and Namor stole the show for me. Loved how their characters were done. Tenoch huerta has an incredibly bright future. Amazing actor. Was nice seeing Killmonger back on screen too!

Also loved how well the mayan language was handled in the film. As a linguist/polyglot that’s always a plus. 

Introducing Prince T’chala in the mid credits scene was GREAT. That was one of the biggest theories coming into the film but since they went so long without doing it in the movie I was thinking maybe they wouldn’t do it

Soundtrack wasn’t as good as Kendrick’s but Burna boy and fireboy tracks were the highlights",2022-11-12 01:03:11

"I genuinely enjoyed it, but there were definitely some weaknesses. I thought it may have revolved too much around Shuri. I think Latitia is great in this role, but I mean, she got to do everrrryyyyyything. She created nine million dope gadgets that literally would just instantly solve all their problems. Got to go a gnarly underwater city. Traveled to America to secure the scientist. Became Queen kind of, was confused a bit here. Created the plant to become the Black Panther. Became the Black Panther. Created all the suits for their army. Went bad. Turned good again. Went to Haiti to chill. Fought the villian. Beat him. Saved him. Just...a lot. Wish that Lupita was more involved cause she looked fantastic in this. 

Loved the music and all that they did with sound. The water people singing was eerie and super cool. Didn't love the final battle on the ship. Seemed like a pretty silly plan that was bailed out. Didn't care about the CIA stuff. 

Overall really good a touching tribute to Chadwick and a good movie. I feel like the mid-credits scene was one of the best I've seen from Marvel in a long time.",2022-11-11 19:42:05

Letitia being BP just seemed skinny and not very “warrior-y.” She had some moves but I felt like her size didn’t really work as a superhero (or maybe it was the suit). Now Lupita or Danai as BP would’ve worked a lot better. Also since their characters can fight well. But I thought Letitia did pretty good (for not agreeing with her covid stance). Also Angela was great.",2022-11-11 04:54:15

"It was a love letter to Mr. Boseman. Its slower and in each featured character you feel the real grief. I think the actor who played Namoor was fantastic with just enough menace to make one want to see what havoc he will make down the road. The movie also demonstrates that (Marvel loves its women) especially given the nasty comments in EG when the women assemble and try to get the glove outta dodge. This was very fitting and while not as frenetic the future BP may have legs. The CGI wasn’t as great in some spots and sorry but the Queen needs some hand to hand combat lessons. 
As an aside I would have not minded Killmonger picking up the mantle if he had been put on ice and unfrozen with a less sociopathic personality.",2022-11-11 21:13:38
"The movie was good! It paid tribute to Chadwick's death in a tasteful manner and didn't exploit it to the point where it was the ONLY thing going on. The action sequences were some of the best and they really made the Atlanteans look strong. 

Angela Bassett's delivered the best acting during her speech when she was deranking Okoye. A few people clapped when the new suit got introduced, Riri had everyone dying laughing in my theater, and EVERYONE clapped after T'challa Jr. scene. 

R.I.P. CHADWICK! WAKANDA FOREVER!!! 🙅🏿‍♂️",2022-11-11 23:31:42
"Black Panther (2018) was my favorite non-Avengers / non-Spidey movie. I loved the aesthetics, the story, the overall vibe, the structure, and the soundtrack omg. I’ve only ever rewatched MCU movies to show them to other people, like friends and family. This one, I’ve willingly rewatched before and after August 2020. That last scene with T’Challa smiling and the transition to the credits with *All The Stars* playing makes me choke up every time. 

This one was, unfortunately, pretty much the polar opposite for me. Emotionally, it was strong. I’m glad that there was sufficient commemoration of T’Challa (which, of course, includes Chadwick). Seeing the tears of the characters felt very organic and I’m sure that’s because they really were. At the same time though, it felt very slow-paced. There were times where I fell asleep. I wasn’t fully awake until Shuri got the suit. Compared to Killmonger, this antagonist wasn’t all that. Perhaps I just admired seeing the stark contrast between two estranged relatives clashing — a Wakandan and an American. While that wasn’t repeated, which is good for avoiding redundancy, it also made it amiss. 

The action-packed scenes were just as great as the 2018 movie’s. Excellent choreography, effects, gymnastics, and all that good stuff. I also appreciated the unapologetic factor of there being *another* demise on top of an already saddening one. The twist at the end was another emotionally powerful one. Out of everything, that got to me the most. 

I won’t give it a numerical rating just to be respectful of the commemoration, so I’ll leave this off on a positive note and say that this really hit me in the feels. God bless Chadwick.",2022-11-18 07:41:21
"It was entertaining to imagine all the hand-wringing behind the scenes on how woke to make this movie. Just enough anti-white punchlines to satisfy Twitter, but not enough to cause mass walkouts. Then the lesbian stuff: ""We have to show some queer action, but just a little bit so we can cut it out for China and the Middle East."" So they just settle for a kiss on the head. I miss the days when studios just made movies without constant agonizing about possible backlash and service to the lunatic fringe. Julia Louis-Dreyfus character was superfluous and awkward. Martin Freeman's return was almost totally unnecessary.

Overall, about 30-45 minutes too long. Hurt the pacing. Entertaining action sequences for the most part. Felt almost like an Avatar 2 teaser at times. Whose idea was it to make a movie with a bunch of blue guys when There's 93 sequels on the way with blue guys? >!Angela Bassett death!< was a bit too much imo. People are already emotional. Felt a little cheap. Decent setup for the next one.   7/10",2022-11-13 21:55:43

" One of my favorite standalone Marvel films ever.

What I liked:
The visuals. Wakanda looks great, but so does all the underwater stuff. 

The action. Very easy to comprehend what’s going on and some badass set pieces.

The acting. Amazing performances by Angela Bassett, Leticia Wright… honestly everyone was dope. 

The tributes to Chadwick. This movie is a love letter to him. Beautiful.

The emotional stakes. I love that in the end battle you don’t quite know who to root for because they both are fighting for the wrong reasons. Different than any of the usual Marvel stuff we see. Added an extra layer that I enjoyed. 

What I didn’t like:
The way Shuri learns her lesson is a bit clunky, and kind of comes out of nowhere. 

They kind of stuffed Ironheart down our throat, although it is what it is. 

All in all, a great movie. Also LOL at the fact that Marvel basically did Avatar 2 right before they drop the real Avatar 2. RIP James Cameron.",2022-11-11 04:06:34

Also Tenoch Huerta is the *real* sexist man alive, Chris Evans who?

"Kinda surprised to see so much criticism in this thread. I liked the movie a lot and left the theater very impressed. Namor is an amazing antagonist. The whole film is so much more character-focused than any MCU content as of late and I felt more emotional involvement here than most of what Marvel has put out in years. Loved the action scenes, they had huge scope - especially the battle in the city. Yeah there’s definitely flaws here and there but I was never bored, I think this was the best Phase 4 film by a landslide and a huge return to form for the MCU. It feels like it takes itself seriously, the way the best Marvel films have. I’ve been missing that feeling with the last several movies and most of the disposable Disney+ shows.",2022-11-11 06:19:33
"Let’s be honest if you didn’t like this movie it’s because:

1.) you’re racist and can’t handle anything other than a white male protagonist

Angela Bassett is good. I wouldn’t say it’s an Oscar worthy performance (she’s had many better performances), but she’s definitely the highlight in the whole scheme of things.",2022-11-11 06:49:33
"Doing this movie without Chadwick Boseman was going to be hard and I respect the cast and crew for finishing this.
When the first scene hit, I was very shocked that they addressed the death right off the bat, and I think with that scene and the silent Marvel logo roll was as perfect a way you can handle an extremely delicate situation.
Angela Basset absolutely stole the show with her performance.
I do not trust Wright with the future of this IP because of her views (which I will not be arguing about here). I actually thought they were going to kill off her character in the last fight against Namor, which would have been a very interesting decision.
Some of the fight scenes were remarkably brutal for a marvel film and emotions were very raw.
A potential three-person brawl for the throne would be very interesting.
Namor was done very well. Seeing parts of my heritage shown in a respectful was awesome.

There was 1 male character from Wakanda of note in this whole movie 

It’s interesting to see how little Ryan Coolger spent amplifying black male voices. This happens when you get weak men to write they always underwrite the men and write women strong as a fanfic.

"I thought the film was great, barring a few minor issues.

Pacing was really good. It dragged a few times but never for long before a big set piece ramped things back up. There were no tedious subplots and only one long exposition scene (which was so beautifully shot and edited I didn't mind it a bit; the Namor origin story).

Namor was sensational. He lacked a little bit of the smarminess that makes him so great in the comics, but it wouldn't really have fit this interpretation of the character, so I won't knock them for it. The change to the origin story was also handled really well, as was the connection to Wakanda via vibranium.

The best thing about the story was how well it handled the death of Chadwick Boseman. Starting with an unseen T'Challa dying from some unknown issue, while Shuri struggles to synthesize a new herb was a deft move, as it made the unintended death of the main character work in the context of the previous movie, with the herbs destroyed. Then, having the Atlanteans (or whatever they are in the movie) possess an herb of their own, leading to Shuri finishing the synthetic version brought everything together in a neat and tidy way. Everything leading up to the release of this movie focused on the unenviable task Coogler had to make this story work without his main star. To say he pulled it off would be an understatement; he nailed it.",2022-11-11 04:23:55

"A few comments:

Angela Bassett ate this movie up. Her acting was on point. Also, she’s 64! She looks amazing. Stella still has her groove. 

I love the social commentary in this film. We find that people of color often go against each other because of the limited power/resources/ whatever it is. In actuality though, they need to go against the broken system. I think we sorta see that here. The two groups recognize that an alliance is more worthwhile, but only after first fighting with one another. The true enemy: colonizers/Western civilization.  

Since Iron heart’s Jarvis is Tony, I thought there’d be a connection to Tony with her character. Disappointed that there wasn’t one yet. 

I thought Winston Duke did a great job with his mentor role. 

Julia Louis Dreyfus and Martin Freeman’s past was a fun detail. Valentina is becoming a real entertaining big bad. 

I appreciate a feminist movie that just exists as a quality film. Captain Marvel clearly had that aim. This one just showed awesome women thriving. Have we had a marvel film with probably 85% of the spoken lines be by women? Pretty cool. 

There’s a novel by an African author called Transcendent Kingdom. In it, the protagonist is a scientist who struggles with her mother’s faith and her belief in science. They’re also both grieving the loss of the protagonist’s brother. The themes of that novel were very relevant to this movie. I enjoyed watching Shuri come to terms with her family’s beliefs. 

I really enjoyed the film. Was pleasantly surprised by the Michael B Jordan cameo (figures since Coogler directed). My only criticism was that we saw the secret don at the end of She-Hulk. So, that ending felt redundant here. It was still sweet though.",2022-11-11 04:47:14
"Think despite how depressing everything is in the story, it makes for an all the more true definition of heroism. Not one where characters do the right thing in every scenario, but where they grapple with grief, loss and even survivor's guilt but still see the battle through to its conclusion. That's the reason Shuri's arc works for me and why she's more than earned the mantle in my eyes.  
Also, ending probably the biggest Marvel movie of the year with a shot of your main character crying is a ballsy move and I'm glad a mainstream blockbuster ends so intimately.",2022-11-11 04:50:16
Solid considering the circumstances. But outside of Namor and co all the suit designs were atrocious. The CIA plot felt tacked on and pointless.

"Was anyone else disappointed with the scale? Namor said he had more warriors than blades of grass and we kept hearing about war against the entire surface but the most we ever saw was a hundred people fighting. It never felt like anything more than tiny skirmishes. Same with the attack on the city. They said it was in ruins but it was just like a couple buildings with minor damage and a few flooded streets, nothing really major.",2022-11-11 05:35:56
"It was fine. I enjoyed it overall but it’s going to live on as rather forgettable to me. The best parts were honestly the Chadwick Bozeman flashbacks/nostalgia/mourning.

"Some initial thoughts:

1) interesting that Ross and Valentina were previously married

2) looking forward to the Wakanda Disney+ show. Lots of good angles from what Ross is up to, to okoye’s redemption, to other members of the dore milaj standing out. Maybe learn more about Danial Kaluya’s character in prison

3) the scene I was most looking forward to was the waterfall coronation scene but I didn’t understand if Shuri had forsaken tradition, M’baku was claiming to be Black Panther or if he was “gatekeeping” and standing in Shuri’s place to make sure no one challenges or something else. 

4) I’m excited that Toussant (T’challa’s son) may get to meet his father when it is his turn he visits the ancestral astral plane   

5) Angela Basset killed it and deserves an Oscar nomination

6) the mercenaries being marched into the UN floor was an awesome mic drop moment.

7) I really liked Riri. I find it kinda funny that she’s in MIT would’ve been cool to see her interact with Ned or MJ on campus.

8) I respect how Marvel busts out the montage of appearances for Chadwick (and Stan Lee) during the opening credits. Wonder if this is the new direction.

9) i was upset at how they had pronounced Namor when revealing the origin of the name (N’Amour) but like how they properly pronounced it Nay-more as it was used.",2022-11-11 05:38:47

"The stakes didn't feel very high for the first half of the movie, with the whole ""protect the scientist"" mission and what not. The scenes involving Ironheart and Martin Freeman seemed like they should have been episodes in their own separate shows rather than a Black Panther movie.

Can't help but feel like the attack on Wakanda should have been the first plot point rather than the midpoint.

Overall it was an ok movie. Namor was dope.",2022-11-11 06:35:07

"First half was great. Great mix of Chadwick tribute, Wakanda’s fallout with UN, tension between Talokan and Wakanda, and I didn’t mind the CIA stuff since Ross was feeding Wakanda intel.

After Nokia saves Shuri, the pacing goes down the drain. Rest of it felt overstuffed and all the plot points were fighting each other for screen time.

The other nations looking for Vibranium and Riri got totally lost in the thick of it.",2022-11-11 06:43:52
"Overall - I was solidly impressed after a string of MCU films that I didn’t particularly enjoy. The acting was top-notch across the board, and I appreciated that the whole cast got their moment to shine and each felt fully developed (especially Namor).

"Overall I had a good time and there are many beautiful touching moments. But the script was messy and I just didn't care for Shuri. I don't blame the actress though, I mean having to fill Chadiwcks shoes is tough.

The whole CIA part with Martin Freeman was unnecessary. Riri completely out of nowhere becomes Iron Heart really quick (didn't care for her either)

Killmonger showing up was super nice though.

This was a tough movie to make so I can't blame Ryan and the cast, it is what it is and they tried their best",2022-11-11 07:10:16
"To me it felt like the whole CIA plot point was leading to Ross revealing that it was the CIA pushing towards a wakanda war with Namor and his people since that is the kind of a precedent with the US government thing….destabilizing countries when they have resources we want, but really it was just to set up thunderbolts (which is fine just feels forced given all the other stuff going on)

But special shout out to Ryan Coogler, whenever they need to introduce a new part of the MCU realm he does in such a unique and natural fashion, between the world building of Wakanda and now Talokan, just phenomenal!",2022-11-11 07:24:31

The editing seemed janky. Lots of quick cuts and awkward slo-mo. Wish we saw more Talocan.

Namor is awesome. I love this change in his character form the comics. ""My enemies call me Namor"", and the reason why is pretty awesome why.

The movie shows that he heroes can look strong even while losing. They lost a lot of battles in this movie which is surprising.

Riri was cool and a nice change in pace, but she gets lost in the shuffle halfway into the movie. SHe just becomes another face in the roster.",2022-11-14 10:25:43
"I get everyone’s criticism of the involvement of SWORD and Ross but it’s logical with the way this story goes. Because SHIELD is gone, naturally anything that involves Superheroes and supernatural forces would fall under the jurisdiction of SWORD. And because Ross is the only outsider they could trust, they would naturally go to him for answers. And all of their paths would have to cross. Yea, all this is to help with the build up for Thunderbolts but the movie  should definitely make it a bit more apparent. Perhaps there could’ve been a post credits scene where they summon Fontaine before a counsel of world leaders and ask her to spearhead their decision to destabilize Wakanda since they believe it is becoming a threat. Then she could be like “I happen to be putting together a team for stuff like this” and then that would cement her involvement in this film rather than just being in the background like “what is going on??”",2022-11-14 16:06:15

Or better yet, don't give a son to T'Challa... Just bring on a variant from space or something... It makes me feel weird that they added this surprise son because the death is based on Chadwick Boseman's life and as far as I understand Chadwick Boseman didn't have children.",2022-11-18 22:00:04

I’ve only walked out of one movie in a theatre cause it was so bad (the Hellboy remake) and I never felt like doing that for this movie. So by that measure, it wasn’t horrible.

"I haven’t read any of the comics so am only sharing what I thought based on the movie itself.

I really liked Namor! But the movie as a whole was slow paced and the fighting seemed pointless—would’ve been more interesting seeing Wakanda and Talokan learning to trust each other, learning from each other, and then to see Talokan defend their borders from the invading US government, who were more clearly cast as the villain figure in the movie, with help from the Wakandans. 

The movie overall was only okay, and didn’t live up to the hype imo",2023-02-11 18:25:33
"I came into this movie with very low expectations because I just havent been all that into Marvel's recent showings (Dr. Strange and Thor specifically)

Still I feel like this movie surprised me. It was a nice change of pace to watch a Marvel movie that didnt start cracking jokes/quips repeatedly and had a somber tone throughout a big chunk of it. There were a few jokes but it never felt excessive. 

I'm a bit iffy on the inclusion of Ironheart because it just felt like America Chavez all over again with having a random new character serve as a plot device but it didnt hurt the movie too much for me. What did hurt was the constant ""Meanwhile, in America"" scenes. I kept thinking this would lead to Ross doing something substantial but nope. Just boring scenes really.

But even with all that, it was an enjoyable watch. Namor was a great villain and the movie threw some unexpected scenes in like Killmonger's appearance. All the scenes memorializing Chadwick Boseman definitely caught me in the feels too. :(",2023-02-19 16:37:41
"I just finished this. I enjoyed it. I’d say it’s an above average Phase 4 film. I didn’t love it but it wasn’t bad. There were things I really liked (Namor, Riri, I mean the entire cast really…the world building, the film is EPIC, maybe more so than any other MCU film so far) and then things that were underwhelming (the story, some of the action sequences, it was a bit anticlimactic). 

The MCU has a bit of a tonal problem in my opinion. It’s gotten extremely ridiculous and over the top but still treats everything with complete seriousness which makes some of these films a slog to get through. This was one of the reasons I think She-Hulk was one of the best things to come out of Phase 4 (I know, sue me lol). It knew exactly what it was and kept to it’s comedic tone and embraced the ridiculousness of it’s premise all the way through. This film didn’t steer into the ridiculousness like say Aquaman (as a similar comparison). 

Moving forward, I’d say the MCU either needs to dial it back and focus on more grounded stories for a little while and then build back up to a Thanos level problem…or they need to go really over the top crazy…or go the Zach Snyder route and make them darker and tone down the jokes…I don’t know. The entire MCU has gotten so huge it’s hard to say what to do to fix it at this point. All I can say is this film was impressive visually, the world building was inspired, and the acting and character work was great all around but these films are having a problem being “fun” and exciting while still having sufficient stakes for a thrilling story if that makes sense. That’s been a significant problem post-Endgame imo. 

The MCU is still going strong. It’s still worth watching. But it’s definitely shifted from must see opening weekend entertainment to a solid “wait for streaming” franchise. I hope Marvel takes all of the Phase 4 criticism to heart and actually addresses these issues moving forward and doesn’t just turn this franchise into soulless cash grabs. I’m still a huge Marvel/MCU fan and yes while it’s inevitable something this huge will crash and burn one day, I think there’s still enough people behind the scenes that care about the content that we still have many great stories ahead of us

My wife and I were literally having that same discussion on the way home. Hoping for some insight,2022-11-12 07:32:47
"TL;DR: Talokan ancestors consumed a Heart-Shaped Herb that differed from Wakandans in environmental properties, the most notable and obvious being that it grew in water; **this led them to develop strengths and weaknesses based around sound waves as sound travels nearly five times faster in water than it does in air. They have a regenerative factor that is disrupted by sonar weapons -- the regenerative powers of the Talolan herb are proven when Shuri survives her stab wound.** 

This is a bit of a long-winded response that entirely rides on speculation, so bear with me here for a moment:

Throughout the entirety of Black Panther 2 there are MANY recurring themes that are unwritten and rely on the viewer's memory to piece together the unspoken events that are unfolding.

For instance, someone above me mentioned the suit that Namor provided to Shuri, and specifically how it's likely that it's the same suit used by the two ST6 operatives at the start of the film when Namor defends his Vibranium.

Even the driving force of xenophobia due to fear of being subjugated to the power-hungry western world via Namor and the Talokans is a near 1-for-1 parallel to the fear of outsiders that we see in the first Black Panther, when Wakanda suffers inner conflict when debating how to defend their home and resources due to being exposed to outsiders. Shuri effectively plays the same role that Ross did in the first movie when she acts as the ""inside woman"" in Talokan.

Keeping all this in mind, the reason Talokan powers aren't explained is because they've primarily been explained before, but in the first movie. Each Talokan had originally consumed the Heart-Shaped Herb, which provided them with super-soldier qualities at a bare minimum. We see this as the baseline even with the descendants of the herb-consumers when Okoye fights the soldiers on the bridge -- though her combat skill and technique is far better, one swing from Attuma was enough to propel her across a bridge **while her spear was driven into the concrete to provide resistance**. So far, the only Talokan we know to possess longevity is Namor himself, and since he's seen as a literal god amongst his people, we can safely assume he's the only one amongst them who is immortal.

Throughout the movie we see evidence that Talokans are immune to basic forms of physical offense, such as when conventional bullets were fired at them. Even though Okoye's spear is made of Vibranium, Vibranium itself doesn't possess any inherent ""magical"" abilities (unless you count Cap's shield defying the laws of physics, but that's probably just writer-induced heroism). We also see frequency as a prominent theme in not only this movie, but the first as well -- Vibranium is an excellent conduit for channeling frequencies, which is why some tech in Wakanda is sound-based. Nakia's weapon doesn't fire live rounds -- it's a blast of channeled frequency.

Think of it like a video game, where certain weapons are effective against certain opponents -- there might be a juggernaut or a knight with thousands of pounds of armor on them to deflect any physical blow that glances them, but a single fireball could ruin their day, because magic bypasses armor.

Relating this to the Heart-Shaped Herb of Wakanda; it's obviously not an exact fit, as Griot attested to the fact that the replica of the Talokan herb was only roughly a 98% match. I'm willing to bet the missing 2% is a regenerative factor against conventional weapons. **EDIT: THIS IS FURTHER EXPLAINED WHEN SHURI IS STABBED BY NAMOR'S VIBRANIUM SPEAR AND WALKS IT OFF. WE NEVER SEE HER REQUIRE AID AND SHE SEEMS COMPLETELY FINE FOLLOWING THE FIGHT.**

Going even further, the Talokan powers and weaknesses are also explained to function primarily on frequency as well. This makes sense, as  The Sirens use song to lure their enemies into the water on two separate occasions, and the Wakandans use a sonar weapon at the end to disrupt the foot soldiers that can't just use their ankle wings to yeet themselves outta the water.

So using context clues, my best closing argument is this:

The Talokans possess a regenerative factor against conventional weapons, but due to their genealogy, they're reliant on and susceptible to sonar-based attacks. Nakia's weapon firing sound waves most likely disrupts or even eliminates their healing factor.",2022-11-13 20:47:18
"I think Nakia said she shot her with a sonar gun or something and at the range she shot her, it was a lethal shot.  It wasn't a regular bullet",2022-11-12 23:49:42
"I’m not understanding why the Talokan soldiers on the street survived the mortal wounds, but then the ones in the third act battle seemingly just die left and right. Do only the important soldiers have the “can’t kill them easily“ power?",2022-11-14 08:21:51
Bad writing,2022-11-19 08:45:50
I would love an answer to this too! Couldn’t figure it out..,2022-11-12 18:17:08
"Watched the movie twice, it's not very clearly addressed but it seems Namor's people are sensitive to sonic type weapons. That's why their ship at the end had the big sonic generator.

But then why didn't they arm most of their soldiers with sonic rifles or spears from the first movie as opposed to regular spears? Don't know. I feel a lot of fight scenes and choreography isn't exactly top notch.

Still enjoyed it though.",2022-11-16 17:26:08
"My partner and I had the same argument. Our theory is that, stab/puncture wounds are within the limits of Talokan healing abilities. But sonic weapons probably mangle a wound something bad and is beyond their ability to heal. The area that needs healing is really different too. Like a couple punctures vs puncture the width of 1.5 baseball bats... 

But the fact that we need to theorize this is bad storytelling, in a way.",2022-11-13 04:47:57
Yeah I was extremely confused by that too. Why even showing they can resurrect if it won't -ever- matter in the slightest?,2022-11-15 00:54:14

"I believe as long as they are wet they can heal from physical wounds, similar to how Namor needed to get to water in the end to regenerate. The sonic attack seemed to be something they couldn’t quite regenerate from though.",2022-11-13 22:07:55
The healing was never brought up or explained at any point after that. It was annoying.,2023-01-12 23:13:56

t’challa stood for helping out the oppressed across the world. not giving his shit to government powers,2023-02-05 14:52:56
"> But nah Black Panther 2 is like fuck that, fuck humans, fuck France for some reason and fuck the world, we’re just gonna forget that ever happened and share nothing with y’all. What an awesome way to honor T’Challas passing by just forgetting what he stood for. Just ignoring it entirely actually in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

Movie made zero fucking sense. Worst thing is that it had all the elements to actually be an engaging story that focused on drama/loss.

Here's how I would have fixed it. 

Originally, T'challa is sick just like the movie, he, like many other regular people, didn't realize it was the case til it was very advanced, he uses a new treatment, but tries to live a peaceful life with his secret son/wife..

1.- This would have been a very interesting plot point, both in humanizing the hero (something very interesting we also saw in Superman Allstars for example) and also as a plot point on to how he was defeated. This is an unknown fact to Shuri, and the spectator (more on 2)

2.- Just like we saw at the start, countries/groups/outsiders are actively trying to steal vibranium, and T'challa is fighting those attempts. Unfortunately due to the graveness and advancements of his sickness, he is mortally wounded by some nation/extremist group. (all we know at this point is that he is killed)

3.- Wakanda obviously feels attacked by this, and re-thinks their contributions to the world, but does not entirely withdraw from the UN, due to T'challa's desires and the Queen's rule/desire for peace.

4.- Shuri's ""hate"" for the world, and desire to ""burn the world"" makes MUCH more sense since his brother was literally killed by outsiders due to greed

5.- Shuri fixes the flower shit, warmonger and vengeance is a major plot point from the get go, she turns into BP, and goes into a quest to find his brother's killer, against his mother's wishes.

6.- While investigating a group that has found vibranium in the ocean, so does Namor, they clash but ultimately she gets invited to Namor's hometown, and gets tempted into this idea of an alliance to keep the peace, while Namor is actively trying to sell her on the idea of enacting revenge into the world.

7.- Namor gets brought into Wakanda, which lowers their defenses, and eventually the Queen is given an ultimatum, which she reject  ( this is like halfway down the movie) battle ensues, queen dies, Wakanda submits, and Shuri flees, helped by her sister in law (unknown to her). 

(Most if not all up to this point is told is back- and forths between present time and flashbacks, where little by little we get to piece the facts together, while at the same time, getting some actions without having to wait 2 fucking hours. Make the powerful scene between the queen mother and shuri, make the conflict about them, and make her feel guilty over lusting revenge)

8.- She reveals that T'chala was sick, he had CANCER, found out late, he treated himself which gave him precious years with his son (reveal) but to no avail. 

9.- Shuri comes to accept that she was wrong, vengeance is not the way

10.- Movie progresses and ends up pretty much in the same way, showing that most of what happened was Namor's plan anyway.

Is that a masterpiece? hell no, but at the very least serviceable and makes sense.

"I get that there's vibranium, but how did they mine and forge it that deep underwater to start. Their technology has to start somewhere.",2022-11-20 19:51:30
Bigger issue is that both the civilizations don't give off trust with vibranium any more than all the other nations. They literally go to war with each other over smaller things!

"I'm willing to give that a pass. 

How many newly industrialised countries in real life bothered looking for and mining for minerals underwater? I'm guessing practically none. Logistically it's a nightmare compared to on land, and you'd expect most of the sea bed to be sedimentary compared to on land where you have a lot more igneous rocks, and thus mineral formation. You'd be searching for a needle in a haystack on the off chance you find an asteroid. 

For oil it only became worth it after it already became instrumental for modern life and we'd almost perfected tools for detecting it through looking for it on land, and even then we had good reason to posit that there'd be wells of oil underground under the sea. 

I think a good parallel is how nobody is looking for rare earth minerals used in smart phones and the like out at sea now - anyone would say it's not worth it. Even on land, we only recently discovered that Africa is host to a wealth of rare earth metals despite their importance in modern electronics and China largely having a stranglehold on the market.",2023-02-17 01:28:43

I wouldn't even call it that, it's basically the last scene of the film cut in half. 

Someone is sure to correct me, but I think this is the only MCU film besides \*\*\*Endgame\*\*\* that does not have a true end credit scene leading to another film.

"What a disappointment too since the ""mid-credit scene"" was barely anything.  It was clear that woman had a 6-year old in hiding.  They didn't have to make it this big reveal.",2022-11-12 23:30:12
Probably just stunned them like they did those French soldiers earlier in the film.,2022-11-13 11:26:56
"Like when Batman [learns he's been killing people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1byycwl8qgc) all this time.

Riri also blew up all those cops at the bridge,2022-11-21 03:01:57

"Nobody in the film liked those suits except Shuri. Every time they came up someone mocked them.

I thought it was lampshade-hanging so they could get redesigned. I can't believe the madlads actually used that shit.",2022-11-12 20:39:06
That shit still looked better than whatever Riri was using.,2022-11-11 06:14:32
Looked like a wakandan sonic the hedgehog cosplay,2022-11-12 15:07:59
"I find it funny that half the movie was so dark you could hardly see anything (especially underwater), like some of the fights. Then at the end when they finally have a fight in the day, those Ironheart and Midnight Angel suits looked like straight dogshit.",2022-11-11 12:32:00
"As hideous as they were, unfortunately it was pretty comic accurate. They should've take some artistic liberties with the design",2022-11-15 03:34:44
Like why don't they just make more Panther suits?,2022-11-12 20:35:07
"I'm starting to wonder if the ugliness was intended, like some inside joke. No one thought that suit looked badass, even when she was wearing it.

Also, when Okoye asked Shuri how many suits she made, I was expecting the entire Malage outfitted with them. She had only made two.",2022-11-14 15:21:36
Was hoping we would get a scene where she tells Shuri that the suit was cool but make it in her style.  She has a specific aesthetic and it would be cool to see a suit that fits her fashion sense. That black blazer with the red bodysuit underneath was breathtaking and would be cool as shit if it were actually armor or a nano Spider-Man-esque suit.,2022-11-15 03:52:29
"That shade of blue doesn't work outside of comics. It should've been darker and actually, that headpiece although it seems cool from a design perspective, would be a hindrance and disadvantage in combat. More Black Panther like suits would've fit thematically and straight up look better.",2022-11-15 04:43:42
Homelander instantly came to mind,2022-11-15 05:49:11

I just wish that the final fight was better, it felt like a huge step down.",2022-11-11 16:59:35

Now it is ""YOOOOOOOO, THIS GUY IS LIKE AQUAMAN BUT HE HAS WINGS ON HIS FEET, THIS IS SO FUCKING BADASS!!!"".

It goes to show how flimsy things can be.",2022-11-11 05:52:38
My mind went to Sanji.,2022-11-11 18:48:45

"As badass as it was.. I wish they gave him something else other than tiny Hermes sandals.. they looked so out of proportion and silly with the speed he's moving.

It was my favorite fight scene in the whole movie tho.",2022-11-13 12:42:09
NAMOR GINOBILIIIIII,2023-01-31 19:55:46
"nothing made sense 

edit: this is just from namor’s perspective

plus they skip over explaining how a college student was able to get a vibranium sample in the first place",2022-11-13 15:03:12
"Nah, dude won. He somehow gambitted Wakanda into NOT going to war with his people, hiding their secret, and effectively leaving them isolated against a world which thinks Wakanda is killing people trying to get vibranium outside Wakanda",2022-11-30 07:15:53
Watching him dart around and fight was really thrilling! Top tier MCU villian IMO.,2022-11-11 06:03:57
I'm glad they didn't just kill him off. He's an interesting character and has good back story.,2022-11-11 23:28:34

"In one version of the comics, Namor is as strong as the hulk and can cast spells almost as powerful as Dr Strange. I haven't seen the movie yet, but by your reaction, it looks like they did him justice, so I'm glad to hear it.",2022-11-12 03:22:53
"He is strong as shit. I feel like he could take on Thor physically until Thor released lightning, which would obviously be very bad for Namor.",2022-11-15 04:32:36
"Yeah Namor in the comics is supposed to be in par with the likes of Thor and the Hulk, if I remember correctly. I don't think he beats either but can definitely hold his own for quite some time with them. So yeah, full strength Namor is a fucking problem for just the Black Panther. It would be like Thor fighting Captain America",2022-11-16 16:12:57
Reminded me of the Black Adam flight scenes (only good parts of that movie),2022-11-13 18:47:30
"There will be a million Aquaman comparisons, but that Justice League Russia battle where Aquaman is able to float and basically fly against the laws of physics always felt so weightless and bad. This looked so much better.",2022-11-14 19:01:42
"Namor was ridiculously fast and powerful. There's no way a 19-year-old scientist just jumped in an Ironman type suit and trapped him. So stupid. She then proceeded to basically defeat Namora? WTF? Also, There's no way that Shuri should have beat him. After he crashed the plane he saw the water why didn't he jump in the water first to regain strength before fighting her again. How did Shuri not die after being impaled? LOL

 I liked her story but she's a terrible Black Panther IMO. It gave me hope seeing T'challa's son at the end. Such a great end scene. All in all I thought it was a fantastic film and definitely will be watching it again.",2022-11-13 00:25:39
"I’m kinda late but you’re so right. Honestly it kinda freaked me out how he moved, like he almost teleported around. Great villain (or antihero?) and I’m glad he seems like he’ll be back!",2022-11-15 16:04:00
His strength is what I want to see in Marvel. The way they portray his strength is stronger than Thor/Hulk/Thanos etc.,2022-11-26 07:57:57

The Meso-American take on the Atlantians was very cool and absolutely beautiful. That was the most impressive throne I can ever recall seeing. I really hope we get to see more of them in the future. They did a great job making Namor a compelling character and not some simple bad guy.,2022-11-11 08:02:51
Carried the film for me. They did a great job with it.,2022-11-11 13:27:22

"I watched it in Dolby, but the scenes were too dark. I feel like we were supposed to be in awe at seeing Talokan - kinda like seeing Wakanda for the first time, but the water was so dark and murky that you couldn't really see most of it.",2022-11-15 23:42:36
"Except for the explanation for his name. I'm a native Spanish speaker, and that was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in a Marvel movie. I literally groaned out loud at the movie theater. It was worse than the ""Han Solo"" name explanation: completely unnecessary, really dumb, and totally took me out of the movie.

I think Namor was one of the highlights in an otherwise pretty ""meh"" movie, though.",2022-11-26 15:11:10
"Felt like they needed to ditch the narration there. Could’ve been an excellent visual set piece….but then they had to make him explain the whole thing. If I had to guess, that was a studio decision",2022-11-11 04:26:41
They showed trailer for Avatar before the movie. For a while I felt like I'm watching a totally different movie.,2022-11-16 05:08:26
Hard agree.,2022-11-13 04:41:29

This movie in general felt more mature and not as ‘cartoony’ as most marvel films. Loved it",2022-11-13 16:44:51

Yep - the song was haunting enough but the visuals of them killing themselves was top tier horror. Love that MCU is embracing this a bit more between this and Multiverse of Madness,2022-11-15 04:38:05
"The first 40 minutes, where super high tech aliens were hard at work stopping some low tech 21st century humans from discovering them was the best part of the film.

"That was by far my favorite part. The tone was great, I’d love a full superhero horror movie.",2022-11-16 02:51:54

"I'm not sure because in the first movie, people were telling T'challa that it was just ceremonial and he didn't have to fight M'Baku.

Since Shuri didn't show up, was it just M'Baku making a joke/reference? Since it's not like she met his challenge.

We also don't know if Shuri still has her panther powers.

M'Baku also can't be the Black Panther. He does not follow Bast... he is Jabari and follows Hanuman - the gorilla god. The Jabari (And M'Baku) are shown to be staunch traditionalists and follow the Wakandan traditions - It was made clear in BP1 that M'Bakus problem with the Golden/Panther Tribe (The tribe of T'Challa and Shuris family) was their increasing reliance on technology and treating tradition as ceremonial.

It was shown that Shuri was using her technology to avoid grief and became even more detached from cultural traditions because she saw faith as inferior to her technology... and she couldn't even save her brother using it... so how could traditions help? That's why M'Baku was more prominent in the film because his tribe are traditionalists and strong believers in their faith. He was Shuri's guide, a physical compass, since Shuri was opposed to the spiritual kind.",2022-11-11 07:35:50

">All of these people are terrible leaders of insanely powerful nation states. Well, powerful if not for their crippling stupidity.

Namor has always been like that though. He's king of the ocean not because hes a good leader or wise or anythying. 

Namor is an arrogant, stupid, vain, overly emotional dipshit. The reason he's leader is he can kick everybodys elses heads in with no effort. Half the comics stories are about everyone else under the sea trying to get rid of him and put someone actually competent on the throne and the other half are him causing shit for absolutely no good reason when he's in a mood.

This is the guy who flooded Manhattan because he was having a nap and a passing ocean liner woke him up.

As for the Wakandans, the first movie made it plain that monarchy is a truly crap system of government. It's a total dice roll - great when you get a T'Challa on the throne but a shitshow when a Killmonger arrives (or T'Challas dad who was also a bit of a shit).

I enjoyed the movie a lot but I know the source material. The fim itself needed more time to flesh the characters out which is kinda crazy to say given it's running time. Marvel has had this run of late of making movies that should have been TV shows and vice versa.",2022-11-15 08:25:49

- Cold opening was sudden and intense followed by the funeral scene with T'Challa presence felt throughout the movie. 
- Angela Bassett gives the best performance of the film. Wouldn't be surprised if she got a few acting nominations for it.
- First half of the movie is honestly great. Second half really drags.
- Tenoch Huerta as Namor was perfect. Exploration of the Talokans history and culture was my favourite part of the movie. Shout-out to Namora who did the most damage to Wakandans throughout the movie!
- Lupita N'yongo steals the movie as Nakia with the few scenes she had.
- Okoye and M'Baku had interesting character arcs in the movie.
- Last act was really poor. The fight in the middle of the ocean felt like a mid-movie battle rather than an end-movie battle and it felt really short too. 
- A lot of night scenes were too dark, especially Namor's introduction scene.
- VFX was an improvement over the previous MCU movies but still not polished in some scenes.
- Riri Williams was a poor character with no real arc. She was just a plot point and felt like 2hour backdoor pilot for her Disney+ series.
- Ludwig Göransson with another great musical score but the soundtrack felt flat.
- No one from Wakanda or Talokan offering a marriage proposal to unite the kingdoms felt off. Maybe it's the House of the Dragon fan in me but that's where my mind went to first when Namor gave Shuri his mom's necklace. 
- Lake Bell's character just disappeared. There were leaks that she would appear in the post-credits scene but maybe it was scrapped or shifted to Ironheart. B

">  was trying to calculate the age gap

Neither character has any identifiable age reference in the MCU... aside from Shuri's being younger than T'Challa. It is sometimes claimed that Shuris is meant to be a teenager in the first film but the actress, even then, did not look like a teenager and the way the character is presented would suggest much of the amazing cool scifi stuff in that film has not existed for very long at all were she a teenager, so I dismiss that claim as dumb.

I would argue that Shuri was meant to be the same age as Letitia Wright, which was 25 at BP's release to T'Challa's presumably early 40s. This also makes more sense with the age presentation of her parents (and their actors' ages). 

With M'Baku, I really don't think there's any guide to his age whatsoever... and even the MCU wiki doesn't list any reference for his age, and it has extremely dubious evidentiary standards. Thus, I will default to the actor's age which would pit Shur's 1993 to M'Baku's 1986, which is seven years.

That being said, like everyone else... I did not get that vibe and honestly can't think of what you're thinking of. However, with Namor who is several hundred years old there were at least two moments. But at the very least the second one of those was informed by the comics... honestly, he should've put the moves on both Shuri and Ramonda... and this was a very divergent take.",2022-11-17 12:17:34

Plus we got the Queen’s absolutely stellar scene with Okoye which was one of the best scenes of the film. It could feel a bit odd going from the political issues to grieving, but the tone was consistent and they still nailed the important moments. 

It’s nowhere near as tonally dissonant as Thor: Love and Thunder where they’d jump between a father grieving the loss of his child and raging against the gods and ten minute long scenes taking about orgies.",2022-11-21 23:00:22

Yep. The first half had the international conferences and the scene where the American ship got sunk so it felt like an action epic and then the second half it was like they realized they wanted a main character and quickly made Shuri a main character,2022-11-26 05:33:27
I don't think either would have worked separate from each other though. Grieving does not make a full story. But it added a much more dynamic layer to the geopolitics.,2022-11-15 09:28:22

the quality of marvel has dropped significantly since endgame.. there’s always been issues with their projects in previous phases but phase 4 in particular just feels so messy in a way that’s hard to ignore. they spend so much unnecessary screen time setting up future projects nowadays instead of creating a story that can just stand on its own,2022-11-12 11:38:56

"I agree with everything you said except for Letitia being phenomenal. I thought she was especially lackluster, her crying scenes for Chadwick seemed authentic because they most likely were but her character had no charisma and seemed to get swallowed by other characters in every scene. 

A shame really because the black Panther character is amazing, but I feel she’s not the one to keep it alive.",2022-11-16 06:00:39
"Agreed on the editing. Lots of scenes cut at what felt like was the middle of a line. Like the dialogue continued but they just removed it. 

I thought the movie started really great but it lost me when they went to Namor's city. From then on there was the occasional interesting scene but I was mostly bored.",2022-12-03 22:17:24

I didn't see it as too dark but I noticed they blurred everything not in the the center of the screen in most shots. Like if someone's face was the focus their hand or shirt would be almost as blurred as the background.

"> this feels like yet another marvel movie where nameless government foil in the beginning is actually pretty correct. 

Yeah, the queen's speech at the UN sounded very badass, but from an international politics POV she was basically being Kim Jong Un boasting about having nukes and nobody being able to stop them",2022-11-20 17:52:13
"The difference between good guys and bad guys can often hinge on a single decision.  Sure, the governments might be right had Namor won and brought his war to the surface, but being a hero means you don't throw a kid to an executioner, you risk everything to save innocent people when there still is a chance to have a peaceful outcome.  And it worked, Shuri saved both Riri and Namor.  

Even if the government was right about Namor (had they known about him), they wouldn't simply be defending themselves, they'd do what Shuri almost did and go on the offensive, probably dropping nukes into the ocean and make everything worse.  Being right doesn't give them the wisdom or moral high ground to act correctly, it takes someone who's willing to risk themselves to achieve peace.  

It also recalls the first movie where Killmonger is essentially right, but his actions were not.  Taking Wakanda's weapons and going to war with the whole world would likely lead to much more casualties than even he wanted.  As Shuri pointed out, he wanted revenge for himself and not to save the world.  His change would have destroyed Wakanda as much as an invasion would.  In the end, the good guys win by convincing everyone there's another way, not by cowardly killing anyone who might present a threat.",2022-11-11 22:50:19

"Which makes no sense.

Nearly every iron man armor looked so sick.

My friend told me after that the Ironheart suit looked like Mega-Scizor from Pokémon and I can’t unsee it now.,2022-11-11 06:38:44
Looks like a Pokémon and Samus Metroid Prime. What were they smoking?,2022-11-11 03:12:25

"Ironheart looked fine imo.  I'm sure they'll revise the design a bit and make it better.  But yeah, first off Midnight Angel is a horrible name for those suits, and I understand they were going for the African mask vibe but wow they did NOT nail it.  It DOES look hideous.",2022-11-11 03:17:48

Surprised Nintendo hasn't knocked on their doors yet for character infringement.",2022-11-12 09:46:32
"Ironheart was made in less than a week. (Pretty sure that's what they spend on in reality too)

Totally looked like a Samus Suit or something which is exactly what a 19 year old would make tho.

Midnight Angle tho.. no saving that and they all knew how ugly it was.

It was so out of place compared to all the other stuff they wear in Wakanda it's not funny. I'd expect Talokan to wear it as it looks more.likr something you'd see with them.",2022-11-13 13:30:13

I loved the iron heart suit. Looked very visually distinct from Tony's suits. Also I loved that it looked more bulky and mechanical than his most recent ones. There's just something so much more badass about it when it's a big clunky light mech vs a streamlined nanobot leotard.,2022-11-11 14:50:45

The movie versions look more Egyptian themed.",2022-11-14 00:06:18
"I loved the Ironheart suit personally.  Why did you dislike it?

To me it looks cool and sleek.  You may say a kid who lacks experience shouldn't be able to make something it took Tony Stark a lifetime to perfect, but she was in Wakanda and they likely took her jerry-rigged suit and spruced it up with their nanobots.  If you don't like it, you can blame a 19 year old's fantasy of what a cool suit would look like over Stark's more practical version.  I think it looks damn awesome with the wings and the gun arm.",2022-11-11 22:53:54
"I thought the Ironheart suit was fine. It's only Mark II for her, so I'm honestly glad it wasn't as refined or cool as the Iron Man armors. I'd like the character to ""earn"" those advancements in future films/shows.

It's huge but apparently all it does is carry the sonic emitter and all the fighters just stand on top- where there aren't even really any defenses or anything, it's just a flat surface. Also once again even though it's a war between two technologically advanced nations the whole final battle comes down to almost entirely just hand to hand weapons.",2022-11-11 04:27:29
The third act is underwhelming. Not to mention there is a good 20-30 minutes that could’ve been cut from this film,2022-11-11 04:33:15
"This was one of the first times the third act formula really bothered me and stood out. I know it’s gotten old to complain about it and I should know what to expect, but i was really hoping there would be a little bit more depth to this movie or something different given the unique circumstances around it. 

I don’t know why, but for a brief moment when namor stabbed Shuri I actually got my hopes up that she would die/be critically wounded, he would go back to the water, and the film would resolve itself in a different way.",2022-11-11 13:41:41
"Honestly the third act felt like the weakest part of the movie for me. Tonally the bulk of the movie felt closer to a drama in terms of trying to prevent a war breaking out.

"Totally agree. I think there shouldn't have been a break after Namor attacked Wakanda. It should have led directly into the final conflict. That break and montage sequence dragged for me, and the momentum of the Queen's death was lost.

I don't think it would be hard to do. Shuri tried to print the heart shaped herb in the opening sequence. She could have made the change on the fly. Taken it as Wakanda is being attacked, confirmed her mother's death in the spirit realm and then led straight into the final fight.",2022-11-12 21:38:09

Just like in the first movie T’Challa rejects his father’s position, Shuri rejects Killmonger’s.",2022-11-11 03:28:59

"I must have missed something, but how did Shuri even get stabbed when her suit is vibranium? Isn’t the final fight in the first film all about trying to get the sonic waves to disrupt the suit long enough for black panther to be able to stab killmonger, and in this one Namor is just casually slashing through vibranium ships and armour throughout? Even Thanos struggled to break Cap’s shield",2022-11-13 08:45:09

I actually wish they could beat the villain with science only, no superpowers.",2022-11-11 23:38:52
"I feel like they got stabbed in different places, though? I vaguely recall discourse about the effects of being stabbed in the heart in response to the ending of the first Black Panther -implying Killmonger was got right in the heart. I thought Shuri was stabbed in the stomach/general tummy area.   


That said, she'd still suffer the effects of taking that wound, and likely be unable to move much, if at all. The idea that she is still able to walk around and even fight is beyond absurd. Like, just have her not be stabbed?   


This is all overlooking the fact that I don't recall any mentions of her knowing how to fight -whereas T'challa had trained to become the Black Panther for most of his life, no?",2022-11-12 00:51:08
Namor was using them to locate Riri. He didn’t trust they would hand her over. His plan was to intercept and kill her once they located her. It’s a fairly common trope for villains to get heroes to lead a target out into the open.,2022-11-13 05:01:25

"It just bugs me how much this movie suffers from the classic trope of kill as many foot soldiers and generals as you want but the second you get to the boss who you are after, suddenly killing is not the way. Like tell that to the dozens of dead Atlantians you already killed lmao",2022-11-26 20:24:20
"I don't think so, I think she was never strongly pro vengeance but grieving, guilty, and not in touch with any sort of spiritual balance regardless of belief system. A fundamentally good person who admires her noble predecessors being brought to the brink when given power at the same time as dealing with a huge amount of anger and grief makes sense to me. She didn't embrace Killmonger's advice on the plane, she's horrified that her subconscious or whatever took her there in the first place. 

When first offered an alliance with Namor to burn the world with him she declines. She gets counselled against going to war just for the sake of vengeance by M'Baku. Her decision to stay merciful made a lot of sense.

I do think it's cheating that she gets to have good advice from a passed ancestor without trying anything at all to follow her traditions or religions though. I thought she'd start to pray or try make a connection when impaled by the spear. But no, the Queen was like ""excuse me!"" from beyond anyway.",2023-02-21 21:28:13
Motion Picture score is out now. Title of the track is “Wakanda Forever.” Very very good stuff,2022-11-11 05:40:57

To me this is already as recognizable as the Avenger's theme. The synth theme being used after the resurrection of the Black Panther with synthetic heart-shaped herbs.

"The film could have shown this a bit better, but essentially:

We see with the fight between Okoyo and Atuma on the bridge, that the Talokan have regenerative capabilities: what would have been a lethal blow is healed on the spot. Ballistic style impacts don’t appear to be lethal unless accompanied by a sonic force: hence the use of sonic waves in the ocean, and why the point blank sonic rounds proved to be lethal. It’s also in part why, for the most part, it appeared the Talokan had the Wakandan’s dead tk rights aboard the raft.

This innate physiological advantage comes as a part of the blue vibranium plant injected by their ancestors, and *said* plant was used as a component within the synthetic heart shaped herb. So I’d presume some of that carried over.

"So, the way I think it plays out is M'Baku is on the throne, Shuri is Black Panther, and Prince T'Challa is still out there.

If my math is right, Prince T'Challa is about 6-8 years old - presumably, Nakia got pregnant with him after the events of BP, IW happens, King T'Challa gets snapped, comes back five years later, and then dies shortly thereafter. The film jumps ahead a year after the opening credits, and here we are.

So, unless they do another time jump, we're at least a decade out from Prince T'Challa challenging for the throne or being BP, more likely longer as they'd probably want him to be in his mid-20s before he assumes the mantle.",2022-11-13 00:42:28

This actually made sense to me once shit hit the fan. He gave them a chance to ally and work with him, he wasn't fully unreasonable, but Wakanda just had like zero diplomacy skills as a whole. I feel like T'Challa could have absolutely negotiated for Riri but Shuri and Ramonda were way over their heads. Once they straight up snuck in and killed that attendant in Talokan, I think that's what made shit hit the fan and realize nah surface people ain't it fuck em all. 

They just never expected to be attacked like that in their own homes, or really imagined it in the previous 400ish years. 

I do wish they delved deeper into their whole deal; Talokan was by FAR the most interesting part of the film. I was all in on everything with them and would love to explore more.

There's a handful of MCU movies that I haven't rewatched: Iron Man 2, Black Widow, Thor: The Dark World, and Avengers: Age of Ultron. And now, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever joins that list but for a different reason.

It's not a bad movie. I'm aware the movie ended on a hopeful note about the legacy and future of Black Panther moving forward in the MCU.

So ultimately, he started the war and attacked Wakanda in order an attempt to kill Riri. Queen Ramonda just happened to be there protecting Riri and died because of that too.

The rest of the world might’ve done something all over to mourn his loss and the Avengers maybe we’re part of  some public ceremony for T’challa.,2022-11-13 05:22:23

"> Scenes just began and ended, with no real flow between them, linking them.

Too much like a checklist of plot points so they can shut up future series and characters. Not enough time to really flesh out the stuff they needed to in the film itself,2022-11-11 03:38:38
I actually like that there’s big stakes in a movie about processing grief. They foil each other in a way. Also Namor and his people mirror some of the same themes of colonization in the first film. Not having that would have been a missed opportunity to connect the films thematically,2022-11-12 16:30:29

"> I felt like I wasn't allowed to have any fun. The guy died and it was tragic but, I dunno, maybe after an hour we get to have some fun, right?

I don't want this to sound cold, it's just my honest opinion, but I didn't really feel any which way about his passing. Like yeah I have condolences for his family and friends and etc death sucks I know, but like, I'm just a guy. He was in like 4 movies I've seen, and that's it. Again I'm not trying to be mean, but Disney and other marvel fans keep pushing his death on the public but I just wanted to watch a movie you know? 

My experience for the first hour was like ""yeah he died. Thanks for reminding me he passed away. Now I'm sad because you reminded me he died."" Again, just my opinion and I don't want to come across as heartless, it just felt hamfisted to me. To me, it's not like he was some iconic character of all time or something.

"Got out of the movie about an hour and a half ago. 

I didn’t hate it at all. But I’m just sitting here sort of disappointed with Namor. Not the actors fault. It just felt like so much of the reasoning we were supposed to care about him came from forced exposition. I never really believed his motivations… there seemed to be more efficient/easier solutions to his problems. 

Also the final battle didn’t really feel that grand. It was supposed to be the two most technically advanced armies fighting each other and ended up mimicking a pirate being pushed off a plank. 

Just kinda hard to go from Killmonger, who made compelling ethical arguments to justify his hatred for Wakanda, to go to this.",2022-11-11 03:40:03

I agree with you that some things were too drawn out like the CIA subplot could've been dropped, and some of the design choices were questionable (Midnight Angels) but despite that I wouldn't walk away from the movie thinking it's a dissapointment. I think it was a bit messy at times because it shows a country lost without its Leader. I think it was a great tribute to Chadwick and really showed the path forward with Shuri. I would give it a solid 7.5-8/10",2022-11-13 03:52:46

The Talokanil are near superhuman and are able to induce a trance with their siren song and direct people to kill themselves. He also mentions that he has more warriors than Wakanda has blades of grass, so we likely haven’t seen the full force of his people. I don’t think they showcased all their weaponry and technology against the Wakandans because they didn’t really need to, and as someone mentioned here, I think they’re capable of flooding the land to a degree not shown in the film.",2022-11-13 11:12:23

Why did you have to make this a DC vs Marvel thing? These two movies are so different.,2022-11-11 04:25:40
I don't think that type of direction would give the movie that boost because shuri can't carry as the main character to have that much depth. Thats asking too much of an actress to be equal or better than Chadwick which she simply can't fill the shoes. Marvel just went the simple route.,2022-11-11 04:00:53

"I think that’s still possible. She was right on the line between good and bad. But with this movie addressing Chadwick’s death would’ve been to dark to go that way. They made it clear that her time as Panther is finite. Atleast that’s how I interpreted that mid credit scene.

She made the right choice sparing Namor this time, maybe in the future she won’t, at-least with a villain that will be more expendable next time.",2022-11-11 19:16:58

"Completely agree. The problem with this scene and the final fight is that we know Shuri is filled with hate and vengeance. So we can’t root for her or Wakanda to win. I think Coogler fucked it up trying to balance both sides as “they have their reasons” that it kinda fucked up who the heroes were. I’m fine with both sides bad/good stories but then you can’t have a big blockbuster climax fight. It just didn’t gel well IMO.

The same thing works much better in Civil War because TChalla is a spectator to it and chooses to not pursue his revenge because of it. And Cap vs Tony is done with a lot of tragedy and not shot to be this awesome showdown (which we had already gotten by then in that airport scene),",2022-11-11 22:15:19

So they offer wakanda the chance to work as allies instead.",2022-11-11 04:35:57

Namor asked them to bring him riri because blue people walking around with oxygen masks kind of stand out. He could have flew to MIT and dealt with her himself but that would bring attention to him. Also Pandora is a fictional planet with a fictional ecosystem, where as our oceans are dark so they did a fantastic job with the underwater.",2022-11-11 05:45:22

Also, I totally agree that Shuri shouldn't have won in hand-to-hand battle. She didn't use her wits in the battle at all. For fuck's sake, just give a million dollars to Araki and he'll come up with tons of twists for your final battle. Don't leave it to choreographers, it should be writers' job.

"> the FRENCH??? launch a secret attack to steal vibranium from the strongest nation on earth with literally just some guys with regular ass guns

They looked like special forces type mercs. And their intel probably told them it was just a ship full of scientists. 

> Same thing with the boat. The US finds the rarest strongest metal on earth in the ocean and they defend it with just some guys with guns not even a hero???

I don't think there are any American heroes like the Avengers who would be on-board with helping the government to swipe some vibranium. This is something the government is doing covertly. 

> What's preventing the US from just making more vibranium-finders unless they were stupid enough to make a one-off

It looks like they only had the 1 from Riri and the US didn't know how to reverse-engineer it. 

> Wakanda essentially proves the world right that they shouldn't be the sole holders of vibranium when in the span of one week their princess gets kidnapped and their queen assassinated by water people (when they got interrupted in the process of trying to kidnap a US citizen with a team of 2 people...)

This is true of any hero. Heroes like Iron Man don't want to share their tech with the world's government because they know it will only lead to greater killing and more dangerous wars.

> Wakanda straight up loses the war like their capital got destroyed, their queen assassinated, and their army was about to be exterminated before shuri shows up (also why wouldn't they use the goddamn fish-people-killing guns instead of spears)

Shuri said she would go with him if he didn't kill Riri right there in the street. Namor agreed because he wanted Wakanda to help him.

I thought it was that bit that marvel has done before where shades and/or a hat = incognito mode for all the heroes when they showed Shuri and Okoye spying from afar with shades on while also wearing unique outfits in front of a fancy car.

I think this is intentional from the storytellers. She is consumed by anger and a desire for revenge. So much so, that she's willing to risk her people for the chance to take out Namor. She basically uses them as bait and is only thinking about getting vengeance. M'Baku tries to warn her about ""what comes next"" after killing Namor but she doesn't care.

&#x200B;

>her superpower is her brain and seeing her in fight scenes felt so awkward. 

Remember that even in the first film she went to go fight Killmonger using her custom battle guantlets. She also participated in the battle against Thanos in Endgame. There's no reason to assume she hasn't had combat training given her place in the line of succession and the fact that she designed her own energy gauntlets. We see her kicking ass of the regular Talocan mooks but that's because she has the boost in all her of senses and attributes from the Heart Shaped Herb. Against a more skilled combatant like Namor she still gets her ass handed to her and he was severely weakened. She only wins by using her brain.

* Choosing to be diplomatic on the bridge fight which allowed her to learn about Namor as well as receive the key to recreating the heart shaped herb.
* Actually recreating the heart shaped herb.
* The weakening effect of the dehydration chamber she trapped him in.
* The technology within her suit that was able to stabilize her after being impaled 
* Detonating the ship on him to finally bring him down.

Her greatest superpower was definitely her brain and her heart. Her biggest weakness was her desire for revenge that blinded her almost to the point of leading her people to destruction.",2022-11-22 18:37:24

Just like Wakanda, he has spies around the seas and his information gathering is just as good, predicting soon the world will goes against Wakanda [no thanks to doofus] and Wakanda will come to Talokan to ask help, and that will be the ""CheckMate"" ie: Vibraniums versus the world.",2022-11-15 11:15:01

This is an interesting one. The MCU's Wakanda is posited as a place from which multiple African civilizations sprung. So everyone has a slightly different accent. Most Wakandans slip into Xhosa because that's what John Kani (who played T'Chaka) speaks and Coogler was inspired on a trip to South Africa. But the Jabari speak a Yoruba dialect, a way of conveying their distance from the rest of Wakanda's people.

"I respectfully disagree with the idea that Shuri isn’t a compelling main character. I find her character arc fascinating. 

She always seemed to prefer being on the sidelines crafting technological advancements for Wakanda. Suddenly she gets thrust into political situations and expectations to step into her brother’s shoes that she never asked for, all while navigating shocking grief that we the audience can relate to. 

She sees things much more rationally and wants to distance herself from relics of the past, including the very mantle of the Black Panther. I admire this trait of her as a potential world leader, but at the same time it leaves her cynical and angry as she she struggles to deal with her grief and connect to her ancestry.

Eventually she has to freakin’ scientifically engineer the lost herb to take the mantle of Black Panther, out of necessity for Wakanda. In doing so she has a unique connection to the Ancestral Plane that opens her eye spiritually but not in a sunshine’s and daisys way. I didn’t see the vision with Killmonger as a teased heel turn, I saw it as nuance to her character that she was legitimately battling with.",2022-11-11 08:46:28

I just found that first film to be so middle of the road though. I don’t know if Coogler’s the problem or if it’s the MCU. The complaints I’m seeing on here are all MCU hallmarks.

2. Weak third act

3. Weak visual effects

4. Unnecessary setup for other MCU projects",2022-11-11 17:29:16
"The script was a convoluted, inconsistent mess. Based on rumors and many indicators from the movie itself, I think that they tried to combine two very different scripts (a Wakanda/Namor conflict movie with the death of the previous Black Panther as a focus and a movie where Wakanda is framed by the villain and the international nations go to war with them to get their resources). The main plot that was being set up in the first act of the movie goes nowhere, the story becomes incoherent, and there are many characters and scenes (half the movie) that seemed like useless, inconsequential modules that could have easily been inserted or omitted from the film.

Regarding No Way Home, it was entertaining but has a very weak script (felt like a first draft or quick product of a brainstorming session). Also, it suffers from COVID filming syndrome: Almost all scenes only have a handful or less people in them in a single room/set talking to each other.",2022-11-15 06:54:22

I also don't see how he was spineless. I wouldn't call raiding the Wakandan capital and killing Ramonda as a show of force, spineless. He showed force. Shuri showed it back and demonstrated that Wakanda is a better ally than enemy. If Namor only wanted bloodshed and warmongering he'd be no different than Killmonger. Unlike Killmonger, Namor is motivated by the desire to protect his people from discovery rather than desiring vengeance.

">Namor was a God from birth, he was never oppressed or mistreated. He was raised as a Messiah. So why is he so radicalised?

Did you miss his flashback? His people didn't want to go live underwater, they were forced to. His mother lived with the pain of having had to flee her home. He grew up hearing stories from her about a place on the surface world where people wouldn't have to flee their homes and could be safe. When he went to bury his mother in her home lands, he saw firsthand the brutality that people on the surface were committing against his brethren. Being worshipped as a god or not doesn't erase that trauma. That event shaped his entire outlook on the surface world.

&#x200B;

>Namor being taken down by dehydration and a newbie Panther was also pretty laughable. They said he's on the same level as Thor but even Iron Man circa Civil War would/should be able to beat the piss out of a Super Soldier. Can you imagine Thor losing to Cap? He should oneshot him.

Iron Man got beaten down by just two Super Soldiers. Also I think you're mistaken in your understanding of the power hierarchy of the MCU. The Black Panther is more powerful than Captain America and Bucky. That might upset you to hear, but it's only logical. Cap has a Vibranium shield and Bucky has a metal arm (now it's vibranium) but Black Panther's entire suit is Vibranium! I think we're finally starting to see how much of a cheat code that stuff is. Shuri got impaled and survived because of that suit. So first off you have to put more respect on the Black Panther and the Black Panther suit. Second, Namor was essentially attacked by a biological weapon and heavily nerfed and *still* beat Shuri's ass. The only reason she won is because of the cheat code that is the Black Panther suit giving her an extra life. It stabilized her wound and then she was able to surprise him with the explosion to take him out.",2022-11-22 18:54:00

The inclusion of Ironheart and Valentina/Ross just felt so forced just so they could set up future projects. You could cut the majority of their time in the movie and nothing would really change.

Plus, Shuri is just not it as BP. I saw other critics mention that there was definitely a Boseman-sized hole that Shuri wasn't able to properly fill, and I have to agree. Especially as, just physically, her shot in the BP suit just looked... Lame. The BP suit's head looked oversized on her lanky form, and was just not intimidating or cool as they clearly expected it to be. Same goes for the Ironheart and Midnight Angels suits that looked super out of place. Really does feel like anime mecha suits in comparison to everything else.",2022-11-11 06:39:26

"Nah this ain’t it bruh. I got dark skin and all the actors carried the movie. 

There were just so many problems with the movie. 

The cia side plot was inconsequential. 
Shuris character development for the end choice was so contrived and rushed. They should have had a future movie to explore the development she came to. Would’ve been better for her to seek the path of vengeance and realize her mistake later. 
Shuri also is just a mid character. Letitia did her best with it but the writing is so 2dimensional for her. 
Also there was too much overexposition and filler dialogue. 

The beginning and end tribute were the best parts of the movie. 

Some of the character motivations are so generic or incoherent. Namors whole transformation made no sense. He wanted to protect his people from imperialism by killing Wakandans through imperialism. 

The biggest problem with the movie is it’s like Star Wars episode 7. They were just rehashing what worked in black Panther 1 just like how episode 7 paralleled episode 4 and didn’t bring anything new to the game. 

Also nakia should’ve just been the new black Panther honestly. She’s a bit more interesting than shuri. 

Shuri would’ve been good if she actually didn’t turn out to be like her brother and we saw the vengeance consume her. 

Also they kinda just went against tchallas wishes and aspirations for Wakanda with the events of black Panther 2.

Just a disappointing movie overall. Was expecting them to flesh out the other characters more since tchalla is dead but they really only did that for the queen. 

Race got nun to do with it. Just bad writing and mid pacing made this a boring ass movie. Even though love and thunder is definitely worse, that was still more enjoyable because of some brainless good time moments. 

The first one blows this shit outta the water. Even though this was about shuri, she still felt like a side character. 

There’s just a lotta seeming plot holes like since that lord requested to fight for the throne since shuri didn’t want it, why was the queen uncontested/no one chose to challenge her?

Also there were like three action set pieces. 
The car chase (car chase just like in BP1), when namor kills the queen, and when they fight in the ship/when shuri becomes the black Panther. 

The final act was so anticlimactic. They force fed the viewer with that montage of the similarities between namors people and the Wakandas to the point where it felt cringe and as if they hadn’t already exhibited the similarities when shuri was seeing the underwater city and talking to namor. 

It’s a shame, was hoping for something fun to happen but it never came. The closest was seeing namor jump around in the air but he was underutilized af. 

The movie was a good sendoff to Chadwick but not a good sequel to black Panther or a good marvel movie.",2022-11-15 05:21:11
"Nah, for sure it's Oscars-level acting.

The problem is within a year, only 5 people (if I am not wrong) best of the best are nominated, but that doesn't exclude Angela's acting are in the same league as Oscar-level.

You CAN'T say someone isn't at the best performances just because they weren't the top 5.

For me, hell could be like 30 actors that have Oscar-level type of acting but issue is you must narrow it down to  only 5 and let go unfortunately of other 25 really really GOOD AF performances, you know.


In retrospect, there are OVER thousands of performances every year. I wouldn't be surprised if actually 50% are shit actors that can't act. 25% are average... who the God damn knows?

Anyway, VERY good performance are many many like hundreds, Oscars-level acting you can say 30-50 is even fair to say.

Oscars narrows it down to just 5, which is TOTALLY a crazy if you think about it, out of 1000-10000s of performances that's the actors give that honor. And 1 that wins, is much LESS than 0.1%, goodness.",2022-11-11 06:53:05

And the plot holes and bad writing weren't immediately obvious, in the time spent watching it.  


Just keep in mind that Namor Mackenzie isnt anything like Quezlcottal, or whatever his name is.  And that Black Panther is somewhat accurate to the last few runs of the character,  not the entire run of the character's history.

Oh, and the version of Ironheart was *was* off.  In the original, she was Ann Suda, adult woman of Japanese descent, not Riri Williams, 18-yearzold of African-American descent, and everything, except the name 'Ironheart' was *much* different.

I'm aware of that, it doesn't really address what I was actually getting at. Why wouldn't the CIA recruit someone who invented the most important thing on the planet? Because surely she can't possibly be useful for anything else?

Beyond that, like I mentioned before it doesn't really matter if he kills her or not... because the technology is already out there.

Even if you had access to shuri's lab, she would have needed so much more time. She just felt like a shoehorned character that really didn't add any jokes, charisma, stakes (other than for her own life, which the audience only cared about because Shuri felt a need to protect another young black female genius that I guess she saw some of herself in?? Sans any bonding moments) frustrated to see this happening more and more. I get they've got to build up new characters but they just feel so weak as far as any big screen action goes.

They then center the story around one side protecting her, another trying to capture her, and another wanting to kill her...while she gets dragged along. Essentially every action and conflict present here is because of her existence. However, she has little to no agency, character serves no thematic purpose.. and she has no character arc.

Her inclusion and more accurately Namor's motives make sense. He doesn't know she's a student at MIT. He had no idea she was a child. For all he knows, she worked for the government.

Okay. What *is* Wakanda doing? Outreach centers? You mean that throwaway line lol that’s all? I don’t think Wakanda is doing anything and that’s the point. The MCU has come up with like 20 or so different secret societies on Earth and none of them are actually doing jack-shit lol it’s like the laser beam to the sky third act effect that everyone got tired of. When are people going to get tired of the “secret society” plot device that adds nothing to the subsequent movies or overall story?,2022-11-15 23:49:44

"Yeah I get more critical of Wakandas foreign policy every movie so far lol.

In the meeting at the start of the movie, they explicitly told the other nations they can look for vibranium outside of wakanda. No nation has a right to all strategic resources on the planet. And claimed they were going to be a partner with the rest of the world.

- Now, they're covering up the murder of dozens of people on that science vessel. 

- Hiding the existence of a major threat to literally the whole world that literally just prepared themselves to conquer the whole world.

- Partnered with that warmongering state to deny a valuable resource to the whole world regardless of where its found. This material that is the source of advanced Wakanda technology and is literally a miracle cure medicine, which could save millions.

- Violated a sovereign nation's borders to extraordinary rendition a citizen of that nation.

- Turned a US CIA agent into a mole then assaulted the guards transporting him to jail to smuggle him out. The intel he gave them did in fact put a target on a US citizen and compromised US security. 

That's not including their actions in the first movie, where they regularly violate sovereignty in military black ops, planted intelligence agents in foreign nations who they lost control of when they tried to instigate a rebellion, willingly allowed kill monger to seize control of the country and supported him in his attempt to instigate terrorism in the rest of the world before his planned invasion.

France was wrong to have a black ops team attack the outreach post (although I don't think it's unreasonable for a host nation to be concerned about a secret lab under what's essentially an embassy), but I get the US and other nations concern about Wakanda and their suspicion from the science team attack.",2022-11-27 17:19:24
"Black Panther: World War Wakanda
It's Wakanda vs the world. Nations scramble to assemble teams of superheroes to assist in military operations against Wakanda. 

The thunderbolts get outsourced to France before the USA discovers that none of the avengers are around, because plot hole. USA loudly backs out of a war they started. Due to the somewhat diverse Anti-heroes of the Thunderbolts, Russia and the newly formed Southern United States militia join because propaganda. Deadpool, thinking he has snuck into the Thunderbolt team, reveals he stole a Fob from AIM that reboots The White Vision to factory settings, and provides a convienent way into Wakandas defenses, as well as 4th wall quips that none of the other team understand. 

During the Battle, Namor realizes that if they allow Wakanda to fall, the world get the resources to defend his own planned assault on the world. He steps in to assist Wakanda, revealing his nation to the world. The nation's retreat because Wakanda was already kicking their asses before Namor showed up. The fob, which was destroyed by The White Vision, due to a repeated awareness moment at the spot of Visions death in Infinity War, because continuity call backs was deadpools ticket to ninja dust while yelling Dammit Brolin! A temporary treaty ends the war. 

The first after credit is Kang Convienently watching but staying out of it. 

The second credit is Krakoa opening to Xmen 97 live action characters! this is the real reason deadpool stole the fob and tried to sneak into Wakanda.

"Honestly I could totally picture a lot of this movie being basically the same, at least in the broad strokes, if Chadwick hadn't died. Instead of mourning T'Challa's death, it would be T'Challa's missing five years and having to rebuild post-Thanos, but otherwise you still get the Americans searching for vibranium, setting Talokan and Wakanda on a path for war, Namor probably still kills Ramonda, etc.",2022-11-17 05:17:30

Namor Vs the black panther would be a bigger rivalry,2022-11-22 23:13:16
"This feels more real. The movie would have been about T'Challa talking about how his father was on one side and his uncle was another. But, since the conflict between them both was not resolved, the conflict was passed down to T'Chala and N'Jadaka. He would teach his son about the conflict of war, the good and bad of being isolated, and the movie would be a father-son bonding moment.",2023-02-03 04:56:29

Shuri’s suit sealed up and I imagine staunched the bleeding at the very least, or included some sort of stabilizing or healing tech. It’s not unbelievable to me at all. 

I think Shuri was great. I have my beef with Letitia and her anti-science issues during the pandemic, but she did an admirable job. I really enjoyed the movie and look forward to more of Shuri in MCU.",2022-11-13 05:27:12

"His people must've had contact with the Spanish, as we see them in the grips of a smallpox outbreak. Perhaps they'd had trade or diplomatic relations at the outset. If he was curious about the language of the enemy outsiders, perhaps he chose to learn it from an Atlantean who'd formerly acted as a Spanish interpreter. He would've had decades to learn. This is pure speculation, but it's also possible there were a number of bilingual mestizo children who ended up taking the magic plant with their Mayan mothers, and ended up in Takolan. Namor may have even grown up with them as his friends or mentors. That would certainly make for an interesting YA spinoff!

It's also very possible that in the early years that homesick Atlanteans made scouting trips on land and came to learn basic Spanish,  perhaps by taking Spanish prisoners to get information, or coming into sporadic contact with sympathetic surface-dwelling Mayans who by that point had picked up Spanish. We do see Nakia talking to a Spanish-speaking Mayan villager, who clearly knows more than she lets on, in the present day.

Shuri's decision to not kill Namor also had no reason really, it basically was her Mum telling her not to be an asshole and her suddenly remember her brief tour of Talokan and somehow that made her pursue peace with a person who she intended to basically torture and suffocate to death?

The Wakandans are made up of 6 tribes, 4 of them were allied to the Panther tribe while the Jabari (M'Bakus tribe) refused to and lived in the mountains. It looks like in BP2 that the Jabari now have a semi allegiance to the Panther Tribe. But all the tribes follow different gods - Bast is even in Thor: Love and Thunder. So, each tribe is monotheistic - They don't believe in each others god, they have their own singular god... it's not like the Roman pantheon. Bast was the one who gave the vision to T'Challas ancestor, so they worship her as their god... and since Thor 4... it's more than likely that Bast wasn't just a vision but actually showed them where the herb was.

But yea, he'd be a gorilla... not a panther.",2022-11-11 07:50:33

"The last few MCU movies were huge misses for me.  Black Widow, Dr Strange, and Thor especially.  I know they're planning on doing a young Avengers so every tv show or movie has to have a super kid come out of it but they're so obvious with it and it's starting to annoy me.  Especially the end of the She-Hulk series where >!< Hulk comes to the family reunion and is like, oh by the way, here's my son, Scar >!< BP2 was the first MCU movie in a while that I really enjoyed, and the way they introduced this kid, felt a little more organic because of the storyline with everyone being disappointed that Nakia hasn't been around, especially at T'Challa's funeral.

Reminds me of the scene in beerfest where a character dies and then his long lost twin brother shows up the next day and insists everyone treat him exactly like and call him the name of the guy who died.",2022-11-14 12:43:33
No second person they are questioning if M’Baku would take the herbs since he is king and people are clarifying that the BP and the ruler can be separate people ie M’Baku would be king without taking the herbs,2022-11-11 12:58:36
"I think the point of the scene is to imply that the throne of Wakanda is going to be left empty. If Shuri showed up, she'll have to take the throne too. The throne and role of panther are separate ones and the warrior falls challenge is for the throne, not who gets to be black panther. Shuri has decided to become the black panther (for now), but not claim the throne. And she doesn't want to. For good reasons too. She's seen now that there is a part of her that's more like Killmonger than her mother and brother. She knows that's not good for her country. Also, imagine how painful it is to step into her mom's shoes so soon? Plus, Namor tried to ""make her queen"", it's probably also a big FU to him to continue being a princess. Wakanda is ultimately ruled by its traditions. Without tech and the herb, Shuri wouldn't be able to hold her own anyways. But it wouldn't do for the new panther icon tying everyone together to show weakness so soon. 

So M'baku is covering for her. M'baku is one of the strongest warriors, but none of the elders will let a Jabari win/have the throne. Thus, the stalemate will actually give Shuri time to figure things out...or at least protect the throne for her nephew. Not like M'baku wants to rule Wakanda either. Maybe if Wakanda stayed closed off, sure. But after T'challa opened it up, frankly no one wants to deal with this political nightmare.",2022-11-13 05:11:16

I think Namor and Shuri truly bonded when she was kidnapped. She understood his grief of losing a child at her hands & she understood why he retaliated by k!lling her mother. They both would never retrieve what was lost either way so might as well get it over with.,2022-11-12 00:38:56
"I'm surprised Namor wasn't like ""Oh, my crew won this one. We got this in the bag. Byyeeeeee..."" and then jumped into the ocean to get some of his strength back and win the day.

EDIT: I can't stress enough how crazy it was that depowered, weakened, beef jerky crispy Namor was a 50/50 fight with fully powered fresh Black Panther. By that logic she'd be getting rag dolled if he was still fully powered.",2022-11-11 14:38:26
Most movies arent meant to be analyzed too deeply,2022-11-14 04:27:58
"This movie was the biggest piece of information in her character, the fact that she’s the director of the CIA. 

We still don’t know why she wants a superhero team, or why or contracts assassinations on people. She’s just so confusing right now, and it’s exhausting seeing her pop up constantly with barely anything being revealed",2022-11-11 17:50:15
"This was the reveal, she's the CIA director.",2022-11-14 03:49:33
"Agreed. She kind of just showed up and is now just here being a villain. Not enough development. She isn't a Bruce Banner or Steve Rogers, where we can just assume some things.",2022-11-11 12:47:02
"Holy crap. You are right. I didn't know what that was until I looked it up and wow, spot on.",2022-11-12 16:50:11
"I just feel like we don't know her character or motivations. She just popped up in the Captain America show and is just now here. Maybe it is bad writing or bad timing. 

Also, agreeing with most that the CIA parts of this film are a waste of time and didn't mean much of anything.",2022-11-11 12:50:22
Thank you! Fixed,2022-11-11 12:44:41
"Not an insult. An observation. That observation was helped by Namor's people speaking in that undulating synthetic voice that most Power Ranger baddies speak with.

"I think, at least for me, the issue with Phase 4 is that there is so much going on and it feels like it's going no where. 

They busted their load far too early with Loki and introducing a collapsing multiverse. Such a major event should have had lasting consequences, but instead we got a show about a teen girl and a hulk lawyer... all while, apparently, there's multiple multiverse destroying occurrences, and a freaking eternal in the pacific ocean. Which based on its size would probably have some major impacts on the planet

Oh yeah, there was also an Egyptian God stripping peoples souls away

All the while we have some form of the avengers parading around

It all just feels convoluted, I know not every movie needs to push the phase forward in a major direction, there's no clear setting for anything and NOTHING has happened",2022-11-12 18:57:14

Like I don't think p4 is bad, and frankly I quite like most of the films, but man it does feel like that marvels cgi end punch-up is possibly exacerbated by covid meaning a big cgi fest is easier than anything tangible.

"Bro what? Weird to go look at my other comments but ok. When Namor first pops up out of the water and demands they hunt down Riri, they know nothing about him or his people. He’s telling them to go kidnap an American scientist for him so he can kill them, and when said scientist is killed Wakanda is the one that will take the rap since no one knows anything about  Namor and his guys. So, going off what they know, it looks like a setup- of course, Namor then shares the story of his people with Shuri, but by then the ball is already in motion. Not to mention, while I find him sympathetic, the ultimate offer to be the only nation not destroyed by Namor and hope he doesn’t decide to destroy yours too isn’t a particularly great one

"The suit was great, the heart shape thrusters even better. What I think threw off the suit for everyone is the helmet. It has zero human features beside the eyes. It is just a blank sheet of metal.

This just look like a motorcycle  helmet or a robot, the whole time I was thinking Eve from Wall-E.",2022-11-11 19:03:24

"Once Shuri captured Namor and they pulled the Dora back onto the deck, I honestly kept waiting for them to electrify the sides or something to get rid of the Talokan attackers, like Captain Nemo did with the Nautilus in 20,000 Leagues. Or maybe I’ve just seen that movie too many times lmao",2022-11-11 09:32:20
Wakanda tech seemed absolutely inept in this movie compared to prior ones.,2022-11-11 19:20:38
It's hilarious that a nation going to war has only one ship,2022-11-11 17:04:38
Wakanda always seems to get its ass kicked. Weird for the most powerful country in the world.,2022-11-11 05:35:29
I think if a hyper intelligent space raccoon with a spaceship capable of ftl travel prefers weapons that shoot projectiles over hand to hand combat you need to reevaluate your cultures methods of warfare.,2022-11-11 18:42:58
Absolutely nothing about the Talokan people gave me any impression they could actually mount any kind of real attack on the surface at all. They apparently plan to invade the whole world with just a city worth of really strong dudes with spears and water grenades.,2022-11-16 04:56:23
"We I'm guessing the Wakandans don't exactly like having to sit inside the hull of a ship for long periods of time...

 I could be wrong.",2022-11-12 03:03:49
"Plus he says he'll bring his whole army and conquer the Earth and there's what, 100 people tops between the two sides?   


I'm pretty sure that 8 billion Earthlings with Earth tech' (plus the Avengers, etc) could take out Namor and 50 of his homies.",2022-11-21 03:07:04
"The hand to hand thing is just a comic book trope, i feel. The super advanced asgardians and super advanced asian village guardians from Shangchi also use hand to hand despite apparently looking down on actual normal human civilization as primitive. 

Basically it’s all rule of cool: sword fights looker cooler than two people trying to dodge bullets (i mean matrix pulled it off, but it only works for small bits) which also looks cooler than actual modern large scale combat, which is computer systems engaging and blowing things up beyond a scale humans can easily perceive.",2022-11-26 08:48:07
"No shit it was all hand to hand combat at the end lmao the two nations did their best to even the odds. Wakandans drew them out away from the city, used ear plugs to counter their siren call, sonic emitter to get them on land and pulled Namor from the fight. Talokans were baited into a trap so they focused on grounding all aerial attacks and overwhelming them on the ship with numbers and bullrushed it til they dominated at the end.


Y’all just love to hate for no reason lmao",2022-11-11 09:04:55
"There were some weird loose ends. Felt like they were building to a Wakanda + Talokan vs. the US military (and maybe a cameo Avenger). It also felt like there was some initial romantic tension between Shuri and Namor that they abandoned. 

My guess is that there was originally a Shuri/Namor romance angle that had to be rewritten with the death of Boseman. And then they just turned it into a classic hero vs. villain thing.",2022-11-11 04:48:38
A full scale war between two civilizations took place on one ship in the middle of the ocean,2022-11-12 04:32:37
"Totally agree. I think there shouldn't have been a break after Namor attacked Wakanda. It should have led directly into the final conflict. That break and montage sequence dragged for me, and the momentum of the Queen's death was lost.

I don't think it would be hard to do. Shuri tried to print the heart shaped herb in the opening sequence. She could have made the change on the fly. Taken it as Wakanda is being attacked, confirmed her mother's death in the spirit realm and then led straight into the final fight.",2022-11-12 21:38:01
Disagree. Loved the third act. I thought it was bad ass and loved seeing shuri go toe to toe with namor.,2022-11-13 04:20:33
"Same and I definitely agree on the second half. On top of that, I was borderline rooting for Namor during that fight as well as she was going full Killmonger at that point",2022-11-11 13:59:36
">I should know what to expect

I mean yes but you shouldn't necessarily accept it because of that.

Marvel used to do story telling much more consistently and they've lost that magic somewhere after the final Avengers movie.

I too was waiting for a bait and switch on the expected resolution but it never happened and left me pretty disappointed tbh.",2022-11-11 22:03:24
"Civil War was great. It was small in scale but large in impact. No matter what a hero loses, and really both lose in the end.",2022-11-13 03:46:24
The shot of the Dora Milaje jumping off the side did look incredible,2022-11-11 04:21:45

Game of Thrones did it 8 years ago,2022-11-19 20:45:48
"I think the style of meta humor in shows like She-Hulk, Rick & Morty, Deadpool etc have gotten ridiculously old to the point anyone who is still doing it is more annoying then clever.

She-Hulk and Rick & Morty are often guilty of using meta to make fun of certain tropes, but then do the same exact thing they are making fun of. The She-Hulk finale is just Marvel doing that on an even bigger scale, since they pretty much just continue to do a lot of the same shit they are criticize for including in this movie.",2022-11-11 08:29:41
"Nearing the end of the last episode things start to quickly turn into a generic big fight. The bad guy used her stolen blood to turn himself into a Hulk, Emile Blonsky turns into Abomination, and then Bruce Banner bursts in as Hulk as well and then it's briefly turns into chaos until Jennifer (She-Hulk) stops everything and looks at the camera in disgust
and asks if this is actually what we really want for an ending?

Then it stops and the Disney Plus menu opens up. You can hear her talking and she busts out of the panel like she does in the comics and finds another panel to go on, which is a MCU behind the scenes documentary and she ends up on the Disney campus. She find the actual writers of the show and confronts them how lazy it is and then goes to confront Kevin Feige, who turns out to be an advanced AI who programs everything in the MCU (think the Architect in the Matrix) she then tells him how derivative and generic of an ending it is and finally convinces him to change it to a more grounded and satisfying ending. 

Extremely meta and really well made",2023-02-01 20:47:24

Huge Phantom Menace vibes,2022-11-11 17:21:47
"Yeah every action scene was straight up bad. Literally nothing that made me go ""huh okay that was cool/fun"". Even the worst MCU movies have at least one or two action scenes that I enjoy but this one... just so bad. The CGI was dodgy, characters movement felt unrealistic and ungrounded, the editing was so bad. The final fight set piece was just a giant metal box in the ocean? Really? Like you had so much you could have done and that's what you chose?

Edit: Bridge fight was decent. I wasn't bored to tears or confused by the editing so there's that.",2022-11-11 18:22:24
I don't think he told his mom. I think it is implied that Nakia told Ramonda when she visited Haiti.,2022-11-12 15:15:54

I'm even more disappointed now that I heard they digitally reduced his bulge.,2022-12-05 01:17:00
In the comics he had some horn that summoned sea monsters to attack the land but that was short lived. 60’s Fantastic Four type stuff.,2022-11-15 00:12:10
I can agree but as an overall film it was pretty bad and cringe,2022-11-11 13:42:12
My only issue is that this setup should be done much much earlier in the film than the pre climax.,2022-11-11 08:46:56

They couldn't track her on land. Not to mention that scantily clad water-breathing Mayans would probably attract some attention,2022-11-14 16:23:02
Who amongst our heroic Wakandans do you expect to murder a teenage girl in their custody?,2022-11-11 19:43:25
I think they learned from what happened to Killmonger and decided it wasn't worth killing a child prodigy (lots of parallels with Shuri) who didn't even intend on harming them or aiding enemies. Killmonger mentions that when she sees him after drinking the purple leaf.,2022-11-12 00:47:47
"The movie and Coogler makes it CLEAR - 

It’s not only in Namors nature to not trust the outside world, but also Wakanda’s. That’s what makes this war even plausible. If Wakanda/Namor would have been open to trusting each other at first, this movie essentially doesn’t exist.",2022-11-12 01:03:22
"Wakanda had no idea who Namor is, how he got vibranium, and what his people were capable of. So they thought it was a safe bet to honor his agreement. They didn’t know that he’d backstab them",2022-11-12 06:53:20
"It's said in the film that his staff is full pure vibranium, and that it had the potential to do catastrophic damage to her ship (when she was drying him out). I think the suit is infused with vibranium but it isn't pure vibranium, so it could be sliced through by pure vibranium. I could be wrong though!",2022-11-14 18:37:55
"I believe because Namors staff was so pure vibranium. But your make a good point, it still feels nerfed, like I thought that stuff would still bounce off each other.",2022-11-13 16:38:04

"This is different.
1) shuri wanted to kill him specifically for vengeance. It isnt a killing is wrong moral, its a being consumed by vengeance is wrong moral. 

2) his death wouldve caused great political change. Maybe a never ending war, his life *shouldve* been treated differently to footsoldiers, where sparing them wont make a big difference",2022-11-28 01:22:44

"There are 2 songs that caught my attention, but I don't know their names. One was from the scene where Shuri and Riri are working in the lab in Wakanda. The other was later in the movie, but I don't remember the exact scene.",2022-11-14 05:34:55

This movie did not need to be almost three hours long.  And you could tell the parts that were tacked on to sell future movies.",2022-11-11 07:23:54

I'm just amazed Namor didn't grab Shuri and plunge her into the deepest part of the ocean as soon as they crashed into the desert. He flies by her knocking her back with force. Why not just grab her.,2022-11-18 12:29:29
I saw something online about it. 🤷🏻‍♀️,2022-11-11 22:58:01
"Yeah but Wakanda Forever is a $250 million dollar movie so not very unfair. I felt that the action scenes and the CGI was not at par even with some other Marvel movies.

"Bright natural light is an absolute nightmare for any VFX work. It's really difficult to make any CGI convincing in those conditions. For example look at SHE-HULK, she looked awful in the office due to bright natural light, then see her in say the Magician Stage fight sequence she looked great there.

Most directors will avoid these light conditions when doing very heavy VFX work. Classic example is Jurrasic Park and the T-Rex, they shot that in the dark with rain to mask the VFX and to a lot of people it still holds up 29 years later.",2022-11-11 20:57:26

"I can see Thanos myself he seems to have several different armies and resources he uses for different things. As far as he's concerned earth is just a backwater planet with a few powerful beings but nothing that can really threaten him. So he just tosses his equivilent of cannon fodder at them. The Chitauri meant so little to him he handed them over to someone else, the second time he moves he sends powerful animals to just wear them out and it works. If he hadn't stepped in personally to take the infinity stone the army facing his would have lost eventually. Thor is the wild card there but he's technically an Asgardian from a race he's already beaten. As for the final fight it was a rather rushed time travel with what was available. We know he's destroyed Nowhere and Xanadu.

Still I do agree marvel doesn't do advanced tech well the asgardians had the same issue.",2022-11-18 22:19:02

They took T’Challa’s goal and mission and lesson from the first movie that Killmonger was trying to achieve through force; which is Wakanda could “liberate” (protect) those brothers and sisters around the world with ease from oppressors but instead they hide in the shadows. T’Challa opened Wakanda to the world, and in doing so - and to continue his legacy - they had a duty to help this girl given they’re prowess in the world.

Shuri was never shown in the slightest to be capable to physical combat (apart from shooting from handheld guns), so her suddenly drinking the magical herb and becoming the strongest in Wakanda was not earned at all.

"I think Letitia Wright just straight up cannot carry a film. The actress isn't good enough because she lacks the depth and the charisma necessary to be the lead and especially Black Panther. Lots of bad decisions from the character, very hot-headed, I couldn't really connect at all in most emotional scenes, and I just found her very unlikeable overall. I thought the actor for Namor was WAY more compelling throughout the film and the character was just much more interesting as a whole with his motivations, portrayal, and how unique the action sequences felt. I would 100% watch a standalone Namor movie diving deeper into their whole culture and conflicts. 

I'm with you on the gadgetry, could not shake the fact that she's meant to be a scientist with presumably little combat experience but all of a sudden is overpowered beyond belief. I don't know future plans for the IP, but this isn't it for me if this is the direction it's going to head in. From there you can work diplomacy to keep Riri safe, but apparently no one in Wakanda got the requisite training because they fucked it all the entire time. I was straight up rooting for Wakanda to get bodied by the Talokans. Namor felt super reasonable to me as a ""villain"" because he very calmly let em know the deal, that his people are threatened and need to take action, and would like assistance.",2022-11-12 20:14:35

It just feels like someone who's been ruling as long as he has and seen as much as he has would know he needed to do more to ensure Wakanda would have to join.

">He just wanted to protect his people. The easiest way to do that is to hide, but he understands that eventually he will be found.

And yet at no stage does he abandon his goal to kill the scientist. If it were him realising the futility of that mission then the film would have revealed as much.

>He understands what is inevitable, but keeping himself hidden can buy him some time to align with Wakanda, who has a similar history of hiding in isolation to deal with colonizers.

He attacks Wakanda after they take the scientist off of him, just as he threatened he would to the Queen. He then attacks in response, ceasing only when he thinks both she and the scientist are dead.

This informs us that Namor still considers the concealment of their existence to be paramount and the killing of the scientist necessary to resolve this.

So he wants to protect his people by keeping them secret from the rest of the world...while also wanting to immediately conquer the world and thereby reveal their existence...which he's desired to do for half a millennia...and yet he really just wants the scientist dead so that his secret is preserved...but then he also wants Shuri to agree to it...and if she won't then he'll attack Wakanda...which he does...in order to convince them to help him conquer the world...while also keeping their existence secret from the rest of the world...

Namor and his plans are very half baked. As mentioned before, it would have helped substantially if it were revealed to Shuri during her tour that Namor had already been militarising and preparing his people for war against the surface world and simply didn't want them to be revealed earlier than their planned invasion.",2022-11-13 04:54:21

I will say, though, that the closing montage was the closest at getting me choked up. I would have liked more moments like that, that were a loving tribute to Chadwick. 

As I said before, I just wasn’t as emotionally invested in this movie as I was with the first one, which was a bit disappointing given the subject matter.

"Whereas I felt that it undermined the urgency and severity of the situation, in fact several things did with him:

* he forbids any mention of him as he doesn't want to be revealed to the world
* he has the Wakandans secure the scientist to further protect knowledge of their existence
* after they secure the scientist, he then has a group of his people attack them out in the open while on the bridge
* he then doesn't kill the scientist despite every opportunity and instead tries to convince the princess that she should let him
* he then reveals that he wants to take over the world with Wakanda's help, exposing the existence of his civilisation, and if they refuse then he will attack Wakanda
* he attacks Wakanda to find the scientist, kills the Queen and yet doesn't confirm the kill on the scientist and instead gives them one week before he'll return.

His motivations seem to change from scene to scene:

* he so desperately wants knowledge of his civilisation kept hidden that he will attack a water station, approach Wakanda for aid and seek the death of this scientist who is capable of building a machine that will inadvertently reveal them to the world and yet...
* he also wants to attack and take over the world which he will do with or without Wakanda's help and if they refuse to help then he will attack them first, revealing the existence of his civilisation to the world

To me at least, and this is an issue spread throughout the MCU, it feels that they weren't sure of how to write a villain and instead fell into the trap of writing another Killmonger. It would have helped substantially if it were revealed to Shuri during her tour that Namor had already been militarising and preparing his people for war against the surface world and simply didn't want them to be revealed earlier than their planned invasion.

Where at least Killmonger had been festering for years and had a plan already engaged with that would serve his ultimate ambitions, Namor has spent half a millennia doing nothing and only emerges upon the threat of his discovery to then decide that he wants to take over the world - I really like the actor in the role but the character comes across as very half-baked.",2022-11-13 03:21:30

Nakia and M'Baku are also villians in the comics. Nakia is Malice and M'Baku is Man-Ape. Idk if they ever planned on using them as full-fledged villains in the MCU but it would have been a good story. Winston Duke is HUGE and is an excellent M'Baku and I can see him being a great villain. He's also great in this as a wise advisor. 


In the first movie, the Queen was going to give M'Baku the fruit to make him the Black Panther when she thought T'Challa died. I thought M'Baku refusing was a sign of respect for T'Challa and also him knowing that he has survived and was hospitalized in the Jabari tribe. 

> M'Baku, there's a story reason. The Jabari don't use Vibranium and worship Hanuman as opposed to Bast. He's not going to be the avatar of a god he doesn't worship.

That's actually a really cool fact about him. It must have been a small piece in BP1 because I don't think it was articulated in this movie. A lot of necessary info wasn't explained about Wakanda. I didn't know the Leader of Wakanda and the Black Panther were two separate roles.",2022-11-14 20:03:27

"This is a great topic, and it's been a consistent debate throughout the entirety of the MCU.   


The brilliance and dilemma with making a near 30-movie-strong franchise is that it requires constant callbacks and tie-ins to string together an overarching narrative. Combine this with an ensemble cast, and it's no secret why these movies are successful and generate as much revenue as they do. However, in the same way that we see genius in callback writing (Steve being able to ""budge"" Mjolnir in Day of Ultron and then proceeding to truly lift it in Endgame), we absolutely see a taxing level of references.   


Perhaps it's a bit anecdotal, but when I discuss MCU movies with people, the most common reason for them liking their favorite movies is that they're unlike the rest of the Marvel movies. Movies like Shang-Chi, Winter Soldier, Guardians, Iron Man -- they exist within a vacuum and excel at the theme that they're driving across. While these movies do possess references and tie-ins, they're often minimal and only exist as a way to appeal to consistent audiences.   


I totally went off on another rant again, I have a very stream-of-conscious writing style when it comes to this stuff.   


Here's my two cents on what you've said:  


I wouldn't say the movie or narrative failed to deliver. I agree that things were left way too vague by the writers either by choice or to save runtime, but as mentioned above, I truly believe that some of the most iconic and rewarding moments in the MCU exist as callbacks to previous events.   


This is once again speculation, but imagine if in a future Avengers film, Shuri suffers what appears to be a lethal blow. Not having officially established her regenerative properties as a trait, writers could sell that moment as a death scene, and use her regenerative properties as both a callback and a trump card against her opponent. In my opinion, this would negate what we both consider to be vague writing in Wakanda Forever.   


I know ""imagine the potential"" isn't exactly a perfect defense, so I can't say I totally disagree with the rest of your argument -- her transition from being near death after a stab into doing a sick front-flip assault on Namor was jarring to say the least. However, I think that in a majority of cases, for better or worse, Marvel's writers have been generous with callbacks to vague moments, therefore it's healthy to have skepticism regardless!",2022-11-15 02:51:31
">the Wakandans use a sonar weapon at the end to disrupt the foot soldiers that can't just use their ankle wings to yeet themselves outta the water.

I was referring to specifically Namor here, as he was the only one unaffected by the sonar precisely **because** he's the only one with ankle wings...",2022-11-17 02:57:38
It's because it's a sonic blast. It likely works by using vibrations ability to exponentially alter energy levels to launch as wave of sound powerful enough to wound.  Over conventional engagement distance the sound would lose energy as it travels though air. At the range they were fighting at there was no such chance.,2022-11-15 23:29:11

What exactly does wakanda gain from sharing its resources. Why exactly wouldn’t the Talokan be weary of the the surface world what brought their history. They were at risk of genocide and their secrecy is literally what saved their culture from being wiped out.

I thought a high budget Power Rangers episode turned on for a bit lmao,2022-11-12 03:41:53
I liked Riri but the suit did look like power rangers garbage.,2022-11-14 01:46:31
"i really liked the movie but the entire final battle bothered me. We just had this whole meditation on grief, murder, death and loss, or as much as a marvel movie ever will give us. Both Black Panther movies focus heavily on the use of violence as a means and both movies roundly reject them. Then when the fight happens instead of showing violence as having a ""cost"" it's instead slo-mo glamour shots of the newest action hero to buy your kids.  I get it merchanidising and building character hype builds the franchise and makes $$ but ugh. After priming me for a costly violent war you then go and sanitize it all by having the 19 year old in the power armur be like ""Hey I got my first kill :D :D :D Look at my pulse lasers? Isn't violence *cool?*""   


This isn't necessarily a problem. I love Arnold movies but those movies aren't going in with the plot line of violence isn't the solution - they usually advocate violence IS the solution. It felt all the more weird when Black Panther V Namor was shot in a way that spoke to the drama and the destruction of violence. There was no heroism in Black Panther's maiming of Namor, and Black Panther didn't beat Namor by out chadding him or anything. She burned him horrifically with a fire and watched him struggle. It was uncomfortable to watch (in a good way) so it's not the movie makers were unaware how to do this. 

I always struggle to get into Marvel because they always prevent their movies from moving anywhere too far from *cool super chads beat up some ne'er do weller.*  This one came so very close, but the need to sell  Iron Mega Man figurines took me right out at the climax.",2022-11-15 01:04:40
The design for iron hearts suit was sooo bad and unlike marvel IMO. It felt like baymax,2022-11-13 08:48:25
"Glad it's not just me that really didn't like the Iron heart suit, it looked like a mech or something. All the other designs were stunning but this and the one Okoye had were terrible",2022-11-13 15:22:35
"I was like yep, here's the MCU signature",2022-11-13 00:02:07
"Agreed. With the new suits, the flying robot and the clunky cgi black panther, it was just too much.",2022-11-15 05:44:00
"They even put a carbon copy of Iron Man's suit freezing(her losing oxygen), then removing it and powering on in the last second(her getting conscious and powering up). Most of the jokes were terrible. T'Challa spent years(decades) training to be Black Panther, then Shuri immediately became super skilled. That Voltron whatever suit even had chest beam...

I have so many gripes with this movie. T'challa's death including. The worst offender of all though, is all the talk how powerful Wakanda and Atlantis(i can't remember the name) are, yet they look so damn weak. Yes all of the underwater people are basically low level Captain Americas with vibranium spears, but they exist in a world of such powerful characters and technology that they just look weak as hell.",2022-11-28 18:48:51
Oh just wait until the next ant man movies takes a 2 hr trip into shark boy and lava girl Territory.....,2022-11-12 12:51:31
"The Midnight Angels were a bit too much for me too. Not that anything in this movie was really “grounded” but the wacky flying suits did kind of feel over-the-top. Riri’s final suit was pretty wacky too, but I did like that her earlier one really felt like an Iron Man suit built in a garage (in-universe- obviously it was far beyond what someone could do in real life), and her final suit did at least kind of feel like what someone who built her earlier suit in a garage would build if they suddenly had access to incredibly advanced technology",2022-12-12 06:26:05
Why does the Ironheart suit look SO MUCH WORSE and more CGI than Tony's suits. Like it seems like the CGI is getting worse in these movies over time because they are just cranking them out.,2023-02-07 16:49:18

I never thought about that before but this is probably it. Shuri and Ramonda were on the topic of T'Challa always being with them in that chat so it makes sense that Ramonda was about to tell Shuri about the son too.,2022-11-26 23:54:56
I was expecting her to talk about T’Challa dealings with the sea people,2022-12-31 14:52:25

"Bit late to the party here, but just wanted to give some info on this - the impact crater of the asteroid is why there are cenotes around the Yucatán area of Mexico, they literally formed in the ring of the crater. It's called the Chicxulub Crater, and the asteroid that caused it was believed to have triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs. Cenotes are basically underground caves/sinkholes that reach the groundwater, and can get pretty deep (the deepest is over 280m).

In the film, during the flashback story scene for Namor's mother/people- you see the shaman dive down to get the plant growing out the vibranium in the cenote, so I guess it's implied that the vibranium was there because of the asteroid.",2023-05-20 20:59:24

White people invented a whole construct of race to justify the creation of chattle slavery. What came after was something like the mass genocide in Congo, which wasn’t even done by governmental power & something you and/or your friends don’t even know about. Colonization has operated in many unique ways throughout European history than it has anywhere else, with many countries like Haiti still suffering for it. Calling it ludicrous is…a lot, even when taking in that other countries do pillage and cause war. I’m not even gonna get into how uniquely gentrification operates under white history or how 90% of Africa’s wealth is owned by white people. I get what you’re attempting to say, but any historian would read that response as oddly dismissive and perhaps defensive.

That's the problem with modern blockbuster genre movies.

But in order to render it, it would take a visual effects team years to match the imagination of the director. Not a few months or worse a few weeks. Never mind the additional cost of it.

"That's just the inherent issue with comic books in general, let alone the MCU. You can't really allow anything to ever reach it's logical conclusion, otherwise the story stops working.

Like, the US military has had unmitigated access to Stark tech for an extremely long time. The bad guy in Spiderman Homecoming was building power armor the  equal to any Wakandan tech, out of scraps. Rody has been rocking War Machine armor which the military has had access to for years. There is no logical reason why 50% of the US military isn't flying around in Iron Man suits in these movies, *especially* special forces guys whose job is to secure vibranium.

But then it would be a lot harder to make these movies if that were the case. You would be stuck in an infinite loop of escalation. If all the mooks are in power armor, then the guys who beat up the mooks have to be stronger than the power armor guys. What is M'baku or one of the spear women going to do against 5 Iron Mans blasting them with missiles and lasers from 800 feet in the air? It just doesn't really fit the narrative that the writers are looking for. And this movie kind of inadvertently makes that point for us in the very beginning. That special forces woman who dies in the helicopter? The Atlanteans are supposed to be this god-tier super power with unstoppable troops, but she killed *at least* five Atlanteans with just a pistol before Namor took her out. If the Wakandans had been armed with M4s instead of spears, that final battle would have been a slaughter based on everything we've seen of these guys' capabilities.

"That's been the reason for a lot of different conflicts/villains in the MCU, is trying to find a way to create superhumans.

Then outside the SSS we have Justin Hammer and all the other military agencies trying to make their own Iron Man armour in Iron Man 2, AIM and Extremis in Iron Man 3, the Yellowjacket suit from Ant-Man, White Vision from Wandavision, etc.

They've always been trying, they've just rarely succeeded, and so far when they do succeed, they get Emil Blonsky tearing up Harlem, John Walker committing a war crime on video and Hammer drones shooting up New York.

So they didn't really have someone who could be sent on that mission, unless we wanted to give the French a random superhuman for funsies. The US has John Walker, but he works for Val and she probably wouldn't want to loan him to the Seals on this mission, especially when they seemed confident there wasn't going to be any resistance on site.",2022-11-11 09:19:56

It's even dumber that it doesn't make sense even in English and these crazy fans are like ""we speak English so it's correct for us to pronounce it wrong like we do with Paris and Mexico."" Bitch, if you speak English, then you should actually be saying it as ""nah-mor."" 

And what's with comparing people's name to location names anyway? It's way more disrespectful to mispronounce a person's name. If someone pronounces your name wrong in real life and refuses to correct it even after being told, then they're just an asshole. It's not like you need to learn a whole different language to pronounce a name properly. So many people in the Anglosphere have this monolingual superiority complex and refuse to respect other languages/cultures. They get butthurt over being told they're pronouncing something wrong and whine about how they ""speak English"" and not ""moon language.""

The debate on Namor's name is just a highlight of how insufferable the Anglosphere can be when it comes to the wider world.",2022-11-14 16:55:27

My take on this is that Ramonda fatally underestimates Namor. Straight after demoting Okoye she (or Okoye's replacement) should have beefed up security, maybe get the Council of Elders airborne 24-7 (away from water). She chooses stealth and directs Nakia to retrieve her daughter.

Surrendering wasn't that bad a move for Namor and his people. He could have beaten the Wakandans *there* but whether he'd beat everyone back at Jabariland is debatable. And to what end? He'd be weakened and have to fight everyone else anyway.

Its easy to see why the US government would have a role in this movie, in fact I disagree with people thinking her role was unnecessary.  Showing how the US reacts to these worldwide skirmishes expands the world building.  In BP1, we really only saw Ross.  It makes no sense an international issue such as Wakanda opening up would only involve one lone CIA agent, so of course there are bigger players in the mix.  

I would have liked an expanded role for her, dropping hints that they are recruiting or trying to create super humans to make a team, after Nick Fury's, in their eyes, Avengers project kind of blew up in his face.  Set this in the background of the Wakanda and Talokan war and to me it does a perfect job of deferring to the main plot in this movie and setting up a future one.  I mean, if people though Val came out of nowhere here, imagine how they would feel if she shows up in 2 or 3 years in a Thunderbolts movie.  Might as well get the intro (movie version) out of the way here and gives us a reason to have Ross leave the US and join the Wakandans.",2022-11-11 22:42:50
I have a feeling she'll be in charge in Thunderbolts...kinda like Amanda Waller in Suicide Squad.,2022-11-13 23:21:57
That was pretty much the point of why she had a decent size role in this film. Explained her backstory and shows she’s ten steps ahead of everyone else.,2022-11-12 03:30:22
She's had maybe 10 minutes total of scenting in the MCU,2022-11-20 05:35:45
"She got plenty of explanation in this film. What part are you unsure of specifically?

Also, it's really interesting to think about how the US would actually react if it turns out that another nation had far more military power than we do. I imagine a lot of war hawks in Washington would be freaking out, and that's essentially the role that Val is playing.",2022-11-12 00:38:26
She didn't do anything villainous in this movie?,2022-12-30 00:04:29
"We know she’s director of the CIA and wants US supremacy. That’s enough for now. We’ll learn more about her as she pops up more, specifically in Thunderbolts since it looks like she’ll be a main character there.  
You could say the same about Fury pre-Avengers. We didn’t know anything about him other than he works for a mysterious organisation and he’s “putting together a team”. That’s how storytelling works. You don’t always reveal every detail about a character right away.",2022-11-11 23:49:20
She literally dreams of being able to have vibranium technology and using it against the rest of the world. Says this verbatim in the film. She’s envious of the wakandans exactly the person they think the rest of the world is.,2022-11-11 19:00:12
"The actual CIA spent 20 years drugging people with LSD to see if it could be a mind control drug because ""Russia might be studying this"". Do we really need more explanation for why the MCU CIA wants vibranium and shadow super heroes?",2022-11-12 05:24:43

Still Okoye did mess up by losing Shuri, but you have to remember that she was outmatched in multiple baddies so its like she was able to get to her and get her to safety. Yeah like I said I’m conflicted.",2022-11-14 05:39:47
*sigh* Same.,2022-11-14 09:00:07
I understand that. What I'm saying is there's another very plausible reason for her to get a ton more screentime in this movie (the vacuum caused by Chadwick's death).,2022-11-14 21:39:11

"Oh I didn't know the character was 16 in Black Panther. Though apparently it was retconned and later confirmed that she was 18, so she'd be older than 18 in Wakanda Forever.

But even then, Wakanda is in Sub-Saharan Africa and 40% of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa marry before 18, so it's not like it's out of line with the general ethics of the area if she was 16 and they did get together.",2022-11-11 05:15:09

If Okoye can hold her own with no suit in a 1 v 1 fight against Attuma how does he possibly stand a chance as a Namor villian head to head? That is one of my only minor complaints they totally neutered Attuma's strenghth. Comics Attuma would have wrecked Okoye in one punch.,2022-11-25 21:40:27

But with Endgame, we finally got an ending and holy _Christ_ what an ending. Not saying it was perfect but it exceeded my hopes. There were real stakes. People actually died (not in the Agent Coulson sense). And major character arcs were concluded beautifully.

Afterwards, I felt not just satisfied, but relieved. I thought: thank fuck I don't have to watch any more Marvel films! 😂",2022-11-12 15:07:53
I had an idea that maybe Atlantis gets destroyed and they move to Talocan. Maybe reveal that Talocan was their original homeland but something forced them to relocate.

I think they could have done it better by simply recasting T'Challa.

"Do you know what a character arc is?

It usually involves a character going through some personal journey or transformation.

In this story, at the beginning she’s mostly suppressing her grief about losing her brother. This makes her emotionally volatile as we see later in the story, as her suppressed grief, especially after losing her mother too, turns to rage and destructiveness.

Finally she’s able to realize that turning grief into anger will lead to nothing good, and so, she’s learned something. In the end she faces her grief.

You can criticize it for bad cgi or whatever but claiming that this movie has no character growth is…really strange, given that it’s one of the most introspective and personal Marvel movies I’ve seen. Literally the entire emotional core of the film is a character’s journey through grief, without one-liner jokes every two seconds to break up the tension like in other marvel films.",2022-11-23 14:35:53

">And yet at no stage does he abandon his goal to kill the scientist. If it were him realising the futility of that mission then the film would have revealed as much.

Why would he give up on that plan? The vibranium detector is what led them to him in the first place. Killing the scientist wouldn't stop them from ever making a new machine, but it would drastically delay the process. This was just a move to buy more time. 

Eventually, he knows he has to go to war with the surface but he wants to buy as much time as he can and make an ally to help his cause. He tells Shuri multiple times that he wants Wakanda's help with the war and ultimately, I think his plan hinges on that partnership. It also sets up a future plotline for Namor where he tries to find other partners instead of Wakanda (probably Dr Doom and Latveria) if they choose to go that route.",2022-11-13 05:03:22
"For me it did and quiet well...

Only thing that ticks me off. They don't want to be discovered,  they know they will eventually be discovered. And they fear being enslaved because that's their understanding of the world? 

So they decide to rash into their deaths and wage war against wakanda and there after the entire world???? That's the shitiest plan I've heard.  Clearly they have some kind of international intelligence network  because they can even track where Riri / Shuri/ etc where before they kidnapped them, in turn, they should have an understanding of how the world works. Slavery isn't really a thing anymore and if you decide to attack the world the are quiet a bunch of folks that will fuck you up for that.

Well no, once again Harry Potter is a person, not a figure. Harry Potter is Harry Potter. Black Panther is a mantle that can and has been taken up by various characters, the main 2nd incarnation literally being Shuri after T'Challa succumbs to near fatal wounds and needs to recover.

So the comparison youre using just doesnt work and makes no sense and is a massive reach

">Seriously, your comment is such ignorant, narrow minded nonsense that it absolutely amazes just how nonsensical one can get. It's one of the stupidest reasons I've honestly ever read

True narrow mindness is to lower yourself to insults in the movie discussion.

Of course the context between two movies is different, nobody is going to recreate ""Civil War"" frame by frame. But the context is dictated by the corporation, not the artist. Marvel needed to introduce Namor and Riri Williams, set up ""Thunderbolts"" and react to Chadwick's death. And movie does that, yes.

But why does this movie exists other than to set up future projects? No reason. It has nothing to say. It has no message behind it, except for the one the same franchise used eight years ago.

You asked about the message of ""Interstellar"". I think it's rather obvious that Nolan tried to show us that love is *literally* more powerful than space and time. It was an attempt at scientific explanation to faith. I'd say it's pretty original message that ""Wakanda Forever"" definitely lacked.",2022-11-13 09:22:05

Here let me help you out... Why did they take the herb? To avoid dying from smallpox. How did they catch smallpox? Spanish colonizers brought it and other diseases with them. So then going to the water was a direct result of the mean surface people who came to conquer them.

>And then he committed worse on Wakanda. 0 Sympathy.

Way to just brush past my point. You said that there was no reason for Namor to be radicalized and I explained why you were mistaken on that point. Can you admit that he did have reason to be radicalized before moving on to a different argument? As for this new point you're making, I agree with the idea that his actions towards Wakanda were cruel and had no moral justification. It's totally fair of you and anyone else to feel no sympathy for him because of his actions. However that doesn't mean there isn't a narratively valid reason for his actions. He is a flawed character and that's why he became the exact sort of imperialist that traumatized his people. People who suffer trauma becoming like those that traumatized them is a realistic thing that happens. It almost happens to Shuri in this film. So it makes sense for Namors character even if it's wrong and illogical because he's driven by intense emotions of anger and probably fear if he's totally honest.


>And yet it was Captain America that curled a Helicopter and threw hands with Thanos. Meanwhile T'Challa got one tapped.

Thanos is strong enough to OHKO just about every Avenger. He knocked Cap out in one blow in Infinity War as well. Go look back at Endgame before Cap gets Mjolnir. He never tanks a direct blow from Thanos always blocking with his shield. Meanwhile look at the scene where Thanos enters Wakanda. Thanos punches TChalla in the head hard enough to overload his Vibranium suits absorptive properties so of course it knocks him out. He then cold clocks Cap as well and KOs him. Thing is, we know that this Thanos is a more merciful one than Endgame Thanos. He is only using enough force to disable each Avenger because he knows he has already won. He could have killed all of them.

Finally, we all know why Endgame focused on Cap, Thor and Tony in the final battle. It was to bring their story's to their conclusion. That's why powerful allies like Dr. Strange were written out of the fight. Black Panther gets encased in stone by Ebony Maw and it's the last we see of him until after the battle. Considering Thanos was able to immobilize the Hulkbuster suit by encasing it in stone in Infinity War, it's not a low showing at all for Black Panther to be taken out of the fight by a similar technique.

Why would he think that off rip? It's strongly implied he rarely leaves Talokan for extended periods of time. I can buy him not thinking that far ahead. He does a lot of things in this movie that makes sense to him but not really anyone else.,2022-11-28 04:26:59

"I wanted colonialism to be a more significant driver of conflict in the movie than it was. Neither Wakanda nor Namor ever felt like they were actually threatened by colonialism. In fact, after that scene at the UN, Namor was functioning more as a colonial power than France or the US which felt odd to me and didn’t make much sense thematically.

I feel like they originally wanted to go for a deeper exploration of how colonized groups can be pitted against each other instead of resisting their colonizers and just never fleshed that out either to make room for dealing with Boseman passing away or to avoid offending anyone.",2022-11-15 19:23:48

Also seeing as Wakanda did not engage in colonising and enslaving others, then they have the right to criticise those who do such things.

I dont think it was well explained/explored in the movie though. 

The theme of Thors story since Ragnarok has been him struggling to step into Odins place. Taking over as king and unlocking his inherent powers rather than channeling them through Mjolnir in Ragnarok. Fighting his own traumatic intergalactic war and its consequences in Infinity War and Endgame.

">Not to mention they keep calling Wakanda the most advanced civilization on Earth, and Talokan is supposed to rival it,

Also have they never heard about win win situations? Negotiations or diplomacy? The Talokan are waterbound and have no idea what's going on on the land, Wakanda is the most advanced nation on land. Why can't wakanda spy for them to find out what the cia is planning, then warn them. The Talokan can then send out animals to sabotage the scouting group that the cia sends to find vabranium or what ever they try to build so that they can mine it. The Talokan should be gods underwater compared to normal people, the cia should never be able to mine underwater.

Instead of looking for a way to help each other, since they are both facing the same problem and threat to their existence, they decide to fight and kill each other. How fucking stupid is that? Which reminds me of tribalism in Africa, which in turn just depresses me. Aren't they supposed to be advanced civilizations? The whole thing was fucking stupid!",2023-02-19 21:05:44

What i dont get though is why they didnt do something with her as soon as she invented something like that. If not kidnapping her, offering her a billion dollar deal or something



Also shuri was dumb. She shouldn’t have killed him, thatd be giving into vengeance and making him a martyr, but she shouldve chopped off his wings and arms and feet to dismember him and have him go home as a warning. “Mess with wakanda, that happens”.

So far, we've only seen the MCU people interact with gods that nobody really believes in anymore - Present day Wakandans haven't met Bast and Shuri isn't religious (though visiting the ancestral plane may have affected that), so we know they haven't seen that their god is actually real.

We don't know whether he didn't have faith either, as his story was opposing the actual physical choices of the Panther tribe... not their spiritual beliefs. He didn't believe in Wakanda hoarding its wealth and staying hidden - That's the prominent belief he shows.

Since his father was born and raised Wakandan, and shared his knowledge of Wakanda with Killmonger... it's highly likely he also shared the stories of Bast. He also didn't seem surprised or shocked about the ancestral plane - unlike Shuri, who was surprised it was actually real.

Edit: Also, none of what I said is the comics version... that's all in the MCU. It's stated very clearly in the movies. Bast is even in Love and Thunder.",2022-11-11 08:24:51
That movie made… a lot of things jokes :/,2022-11-12 01:13:59
what was the joke,2022-11-12 03:23:40
"They don't *know* they exist. Just like how the modern day people didn't know or believe Thor actually existed.

It's been hundreds or thousands of years in most cases since any of the existing gods interacted with people in the MCU before the current period. If my Dad told me a super strong woman wearing a panther outfit adorned in gold told me where a magical glowing heart-shaped fruit that gave him super strength... I'd be inclined to believe him because there is proof - but if it was something my 2nd cousins third wife had told me... probably not.

Faith is just a belief in a story someone else told you about something. So those in the panther tribe who take on the mantel of BP believe in the story passed down by their ancestors to some degree because they at least get some *proof* in the form of getting to visit the ancestral plane AND the powers given by the fruit. They can't prove Bast exists because the last person to have actually met Bast was their ancestor over a thousand years ago, but 2/3 parts of the faith have been shown to be legit... so it's reasonable for them to have faith in Bast also existing.

The Jabari don't have a magical fruit that gives them powers and don't get to go to the ancestral plane (as far as we know), so there is no reason for them to believe, or have faith, in the story that is passed down through the generations of the panther tribe. Instead they were provided the trees in the mountain that they use for wood, so they have every reason to believe Hanuman exists because they have their own proof for their own stories.

Patron gods come from the same faith, Hanuman and Bast are different faiths. Believing only your god exists doesn't negate other people believing in a different god, you just believe they're wrong. We have no idea if the Wakandans who follow Bast - The 4 tribes who allied to the Panther tribe follow Bast since the first BP - believe that Hanuman also exists. Considering they still consider Jabari as Wakandans, it's likely the average Wakandan just thinks they're full of crap instead of believing Hanuman exists - Since thes non-Jabari only ever refer to Bast and the Jabari only refer to Hanuman.",2022-11-12 15:30:53
"Yep! Well, more than assumed. The Wakandans (Minus the Jabari) believe that BP is the avatar of Bast - As in Bast blesses the BP with the powers it has. It's unknown whether the average Wakandan actually knows about the heart shaped herb - We've only seen chiefs, scientists and priests express knowledge of it. BP is the protector that Bast has blessed the Wakandans.

It could later be 'revealed' (Built on storywise) that Bast interacted with the Wakandans in order to protect and hide the vibranium - As it is an extraterrestrial metal, and extremely limited in supply.",2022-11-15 03:09:26
"Yea, I get that.

We all have different racial connotations around the world. It's common place to call someone a monkey or cheeky monkey in Australia - It just means someone who is being silly or a bit of a fool. It's less used now, but if you call someone an ape, you're saying they're all feet and no hands. Using those terms to be racist definitely still happens here, and it's usually through American influence.

So Black Gorilla probably wouldn't necessarily be seen as racially insulting here - Black Abbo or Black Gin on the other hand 100% would.

I can 100% see an issue with Man-Ape, though - Man is used to describe the ape... the ape is like a man. It'd be like saying Man-Spider - The spider is like a man. We can say yellow sun, and that means the sun is yellow, whereas sun yellow would mean the yellow is like the sun.",2022-11-17 06:53:41

"I was totally fine with it being really dark and mysterious. Rather than the Aquaman route which made Atlantis this loud and vibrant underwater Las Vegas. I mean it looked pretty but I bought into Talokan much more. It struck me as a far more realistic depiction of what an underwater civilization could look and feel like. 

Aquaman's Atlantis was safe and comfortable. Like here is a city where modern people would design an underwater civilization tailored to humanity as we know it.

Namor's Talokan was the opposite. Not a city tailored to normal humanity, but a city tailored to a true underwater nation of people. It's dark and mysterious to us, but perfectly comfortable and normal to them.",2022-11-12 16:43:42

"Damn, that actually makes a lot of sense. I know how useful shadows are in art and animation, and how special effects teams love using the darkness to highlight and make the subject more realistic (Rex scene in Jurassic Park, for example), but to think of it being used to hide unfinished areas...man, that's grim. 

I can see now why some older films have special effects that hold up a lot better than newer ones. Sucks to be part of a huge production line instead of a standalone piece, eh. Talokan would've been such an amazing sight to behold if it wasn't shoehorned into Black Panther's list of plotlines. A lot of the superhero films feel this way nowadays — different set pieces tacked together to show as many new series and subplots as they can instead of letting them breathe and flow naturally.",2022-11-12 09:14:54

When you see the extent that global powers went to to [recover/steal nukes during the cold war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian), when nukes were the be-all-end-all weapon, what they did to secure vibranium after they finally confirmed it was there is farcical.

There would've been an interesting dynamic if Telokan and the UN went ahead and started scrapping and the deciding factor on who got to win the conflict was whomever Wakanda decided to tap for victory.

I dunno, too smooth or untextured maybe, almost like it was plastic rather than armor. Reminded me of some of the later Transformers. Just felt noticeably CGI in motion, compared to everything else going on.

Which, side note, why does it feel like Black Panther is always getting the short end of the VFX stick? While most of the movie looked great, there were still plenty of shots that were extremely obvious, which reminded me of the infamous BP vs Killmonger fight. The shots of Shuri in the cockpit, piloting the aircrafts like the Dragon Flyers were such obvious green screen shots that it looked goofy as hell whenever they went back to that angle. Same with some shots of the capital and action sequences that looked choppy. Felt like when my computer skips frames during an intense part of a game.",2022-11-11 16:05:59

">	But idk Shuri just didn’t seem like the right pick for BP story-wise, either.

I understand not liking the actress because of her personal views, but this is nonsense.

People say Okoye and Nakia should’ve been BP because they proved to kick ass in the first movie, but I feel like people aren’t really remembering the movie well. Shuri was right there in the fight just like them the whole time. In fact, Okoye stays back and doesn’t join them in the first after Killmonger becomes King. Ramonda asks Nakia to take the herb in the first, she flat out refuses saying she’s a spy and won’t. Okoye wouldn’t either, given what happened in this one as well as BP1. Shuri was there for every battle - unlike Nakia - including the Endgame battle. 

Shuri was absolutely right story wise because she became BP the same reason and way T’Challa did in Civil War - for vengeance. 

Anyone who says Shuri shouldn’t have been BP is just letting their personal views of the actress come through. And while I get it, it’s disingenuous to say it doesn’t make sense. And I also hope the same energy is kept for Evangeline Lilly when Quantumania comes out on February.",2022-11-11 04:57:49

How people are kissing this is honestly interesting.

">Why would he give up on that plan? The vibranium detector is what led them to him in the first place. Killing the scientist wouldn't stop them from ever making a new machine, but it would drastically delay the process. This was just a move to buy more time.

His own self-explained backstory included him violently encountering the outside world almost half a millennia prior and is used to inform his desire to conquer the world. Why does he suddenly need more time?

He tasked Wakanda to get the scientist and then during that task, he sent his own people to attack them on the bridge in full sight of the authorities; risking exposure despite his desire to be kept secret. If not for Shuri using her tech to speak with them and their decision to return her to their city as a result, she and Okoye would have been killed and he would have immediately triggered war with Wakanda.

If his intentions from the get go were to have Wakanda join him in his efforts and time spent to convince them mattered more than the urgency of resolving the threat of the scientist, why did he attack them on the bridge? Why wasn't the scientist killed before there was even the opportunity to learn that it was Princess Shuri? Why upon learning that he had the princess did he subsequently threaten the Queen? Why did he only kill the Queen and not the scientist as well? How was attacking Wakanda's capital and killing multitudes of its people, including the Queen, serving his goal?

The script puts forward that he meant for Wakanda to keep silent on their knowledge of him for threat of conflict, and he attacked their people retrieving the scientist in order to ensure they had her and otherwise kill those with knowledge about the plan and the existence of him and his people.

There's a disharmony between the goals and actions of Namor between the first and second halves of the film.

>Eventually, he knows he has to go to war with the surface but he wants to buy as much time as he can and make an ally to help his cause.

It's not presented that he *has* to go to war with the surface world but that he *wants* to and has wanted to since he encountered and killed surface dwellers as a child, half a millennia prior to the events of the film.

>He tells Shuri multiple times that he wants Wakanda's help with the war and ultimately, I think his plan hinges on that partnership.

But then why would he immediately make an enemy of them?   


>It also sets up a future plotline for Namor where he tries to find other partners instead of Wakanda (probably Dr Doom and Latveria) if they choose to go that route

We can only judge on what we have right now, not the possibility of the future, and I am judging what I consider to be flaws in the story of this film.",2022-11-13 08:05:02

">GSP is beefed up but even he could only play a villain because he wasnt quite beefed up enough

I'm curious as to how you know this specifically. I would have assumed he's playing a villain because he's not a professional actor. He can do a role where he talks little and had to be athletic ic but not carry anything more than that. Also, keep in mind that was an older GSP not close to his physical prime. 

>Even those you mentioned, which are quite the outliars imho, (also gsp is short), are still not as juiced up as both MCU chrisses in their prime.

Aren't the Chrisses outliers as well? Go through the rest of the male Avengers rq. RDJ, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Rudd, Don Cheedle have nowhere near body builder bodies. Then there's guys like Chadwick and Christ Pratt who while being well-built give no indication of some superhuman/bodybuilder physique. I guess next closest to that would be David Bautista but he's a former pro wrestler and you know how they love to roid. I think all the guys with the bets physiques fit their characters.

"I’m not speaking specifically on the genocide portion only, as you seem to be fixated on. In terms of this film specifically, they established that the only focus for Namor was his people protection and anonymity by any means necessary. The search for Vibranium in addition to him viewing the atrocities done by the surface world caused his extremist beliefs that the only way to completely protect his people was to destroy anyone else. Is that right? Obviously not, however it is explained well and has some nuance to it vs. him being a mustache twirling villain who wants to kill everyone for no good reason. In terms of Riri, again he’s a character who’s been alive for certuries who sees this one child who has the ability to expose NotAtlantis and his people after centuries of anonymity, of course with his mind set he’d rather off her than take any chances they are exposed. Again, is that right? No, but the explain why throughout the film.

In the comics there are plenty of moments where Namor is an asshole and only gives a fuck about his people, but still is right. Almost the entirety of Secret Wars (2016) is Namor doing what needed to be done to ensure the survival of 616 during the incursions when the heroes within the Illuminati could not.

">do we REALLY want to take one of our best weapons off the table right now?” 

They were on defcon 1 from the cia and Namor, their princess was taken and the only bargaining chip they had was lost. Their defenses sucked ass and that's when she decided to fire her most loyal general? The general who has been training their army since forever and a day?

Also the queen acted like Okoye just gave her up. Shuri didn't listen to her and Shuri demanded to be taken to Namor. Okoye fought off three of them, mortally wounding them and she fought off their leader. As if that wasn't enough the fucking government was also after them. The queen was wrong for firing her because she did everything that she could and nearly died for it. What did she expect from Okoye? Sure she convinced her to allow her to take Shuri with her, but she could have given them guards too.

Also why did they let the outside world know that the Black Panther died? They have been hidden for so long and this is the moment that they decide to tell the world that they're defenseless? Also Shuri said that Namor had vabranium all over him, you know the thing that they have studied for so long, the thing they weaponized, the only thing that they have mastered and are known for. Still they had no way of tracking him/the vabranium on him? 

Finally they took that little girl who built the machine to their advanced lab, showed her their country and customs. The same girl that's being chased by the government that tried to invade them. They claim to have taken care of it, but how will they know if the cia just abducts her in a month or two? Alot of dumb decisions were made left and right.

"Yeah, everything you pointed out made sense. I was looking at it more from the self contained perspective of BP2 rather than the larger franchise, you made good points.

I just felt like the whole time, it seemed like Shuri was building to a bigger realization that didn't come until the last possible moment which I realize is typical storytelling and particularly typical marvel storytelling but it didn't feel like it fit with the Shuri I had in my head, the Shuri that relied on science and reason and was imo both the levity and the grounding force in her family. I just really wanted her to come out of seeing N'Jadaka with some revelation other than ""I have been abandoned by my family and I'm super ruthless now"".

Honestly it felt like a very Male Character reaction, and I'm of two minds about it because on the one hand, good that they are not writing Shuri any differently than they would a male protag, but on the other hand, it just doesn't work for me personally. It didn't work for me that she just played Namor's game instead of finding a more clever path.

I really don't care who they get to be the new BP, as long as its good, and I havent seen BP2 but I know that Shuri was deeply annoying to me in Black Panther, unlike basically every single other member of the cast.

RDJ - [Had a phenomenal physique in the Iron Man movies](https://cbtworld.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/robert-downey-jr-iron-man-2-fitness-philippines.jpg) (a bit less so in Endgame) even though the plot didn't really necessitate it.

Benedict Cumberbatch - He's a wizard so it would just be bizarre if he was too beefy. Wouldn't fit the image of a wizard. He was still pretty buff though.

Paul Rudd - Beefy body with a six pack for Ant Man. 

Don Cheadle - Fair enough, but he's a minor enough character that it's not super strong evidence against the argument that they beef up their cast too much.

Keep in mind that Thor, Captain America, and Spiderman all have significant plot-related reasons to have athletic builds, but these other guys don't.

>Then there's guys like Chadwick and Christ Pratt who while being well-built give no indication of some superhuman/bodybuilder physique. 

Chadwick looked insane, Kilmonger even moreso. I really don't think Kilmonger looked like a Cruiserweight/Heavyweight UFC fighter, who don't need anywhere near that amount of definition in their muscles.

Chris Pratt's character is a goofball and his great physique stands out quite a bit.",2023-02-06 20:51:28

"I'm Guatemalan so I appreciated the representation bc we are the least represented people in the marvel universe. And i think they did their best to be respectful, brought in historians and a language couch and actually cast LatinX actors. The art production and design was great, I noticed them playing an ancient Mayan ball game. But it was clunky.

Why does Namor have a Spanish accent? Why did he choose a name based in the language of the colonizers he hated so much? 

Why are some of them blue but not others? Why change their skin color at all when it doesn't mean much and covers up the real people? 

Did they have Mayan or LatinX people involved in the writing? It just felt like an outsider using Mayan culture instead of them telling their own story. 

I get that everyone's just happy to be seen at all, but that seems like a pretty low bar. I think the reason it stands out so much is bc it's in contrast to the incredible thoughtfulness of Wakanda, written and produced by black people. 

We don't get a lot of complexity or spend time getting to know the Mayan characters, except Namor and he's inconsistent. 

They've evolved under the water but their movements are super awkward, they don't look natural. I've seen scuba divers look more at ease than these people who supposedly live down there. 

I didn't understand their physiology or their powers, e.g., why do they inconsistently wear that breathing mask? Why could they just climb up the side of the ship like spiderman? How did they successfully fight surface people when they went to burry his mother when they'd never felt surface gravity before? How do they communicate in the water, they still use their voices to communicate and hypnotize so do they spend a lot of time out of the water too, maybe in cenotes?

In French it’s Mexique, in German it’s Mexiko, etc, etc.

In this movie Namor introduces himself in English, then the Wakandans (and I’m pretty sure the American Riri Williams too) mispronounce his name (in English) the entire movie. Even after he teaches Shuri the etymology of his name, El niño sin amor. In universe, it’s just flat out disrespectful.

I don't think that was established in-movie and it's not true in the source material, either. 

As long as they have their water-breathing masks, their strength and durability remain intact. The dehydrator thing worked on Namor specifically because he is a mutant that breathes air with the help of his skin, which allows him to be amphibious.

Hard to say.  From a character perspective things are pretty rough right now.  Nobody has shown they can fill Tony Starks spot yet.  I always thought T’Challa was a good replacement for the Steve Rodgers role but that’s out due to the passing of Chadwick.  Really it all depends on how things play out before the next Avengers film.  Avengers is like the culmination of the stories that led up to it.  So if the Avengers film gets a mid response than the MCU is on its last legs and will be done in the next 10 years give or take.  But if it does what it’s suppose to do and leaves people drooling for what’s to come next than the MCU will be here to stay far longer than that.,2022-11-12 16:09:02

"I get the movies don't explain this shit well enough in their attempt to tackle and setup too many characters and teams and plots all at the same time, like here where they rob precious screentime from Wakanda/Talokan just so they can further setup Ironheart and Thunderbolts. Especially Valentina, who literally does nothing but exist to further establish that the US wants vibranium when they already had the US expedition slaughtered by Namor to establish that. But how you gonna come in here and call other people brain damaged for not understanding MCU lore while then fucking up basic info or plot points from previous movies?

> That's not relevant to the point of people pretending the US doesn't deploy supers for black ops.

Which is an argument I didn't make. I straight up acknowledged that heroes like Captain America, Falcon, and War Machine do and have expressly worked for the US government specifically. But the ""black ops"" mission you're talking about wasn't black ops at all (black ops != any stealth operation); it was literally a hostage rescue mission from pirates led by a dude on Interpol's most wanted list. And yeah, having U.S. Agent in the raid in BP2 would have been a cool, extra nod to the eventual Thunderbolts project... but it was a **French** black ops mission in the movie, so why would **US Agent** be there?

However, S.H.I.E.L.D is explicitly an extra-governmental agency created by the Allies of WW2 for the protection of both the US and international community, so they operate under the oversight of the World Security Council. When agents like Black Widow or Hawkeye are used, it's only at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s discretion. Under Nick Fury, they've repeatedly completely ignored missions from the US government if he didn't feel like it required them (like leaving the rescue of Tony Stark to the Army), worked against them (preventing the Army from capturing Bruce Banner), or disobeyed the World Security Council in the US's favor (refusing to nuke NYC during the Chitauri invasion). Again, in the same movie you're talking about Cap being a ""black ops"" agent, S.H.I.E.L.D was openly disavowed by the US government, labeled a terrorist organization, and largely wiped out as an agency when they were revealed to have been infiltrated by HYDRA. It took until the signing of the Sokovia Accords to allow S.H.I.E.L.D to exist again, where supposed ""black ops"" agent Captain America defects from America because he's against the idea of government oversight crippling their ability to do their job in an effective, independent way.

>""I'm Agent Phil Coulson with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.""

> ""That's quite a mouthful.""

> ""I know. We're working on it.""

> ""You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...""

> ""We're a separate division with a more specific focus.""

This is why Valentina, as director of the CIA, wants people like US Agent for the Thunderbolts. It's just the CIA version of the Suicide Squad, where they want supers that are beholden only to the American government for actual black ops missions, rather than the hard-to-control supers like The Avengers.",2022-11-16 19:57:27

The argument becomes laughable when you start factoring in Guardians of the Galaxy which is just as colourful as Aquaman if not more so, and yet no-one says Guardians is good *because* it’s colourful.

Marvel uses soundstages the same as anyone else, but they rarely feel as obvious and cheap as those in Aquaman. Aquaman’s soundstages were comparable in quality to Red Notice and…eurgh that was rough. Much of the time you can’t even tell Marvel have shot on a sound stage.

The trench sequence was beautiful…and it still put me to sleep. Literally. Black Panther builds the nation of Wakanda to a much deeper level than any of the nations in Aquaman.

There are so many characters throughout comics that were created with the intention to replace the lead, I find it odd you only have an issue with the ones that are black or gay, were you this upset when DC introduced 4 new supermen after Superman died in the 90's, or were you just upset about John Henry Irons because he was the only one who wasn't white?

Namor's people attacked the girl first, then the Wakandas defended her starting the fight.

The princess asked to go to Namor, she put herself in that position. Side point, major plot hole here is that Shuri's AI did not mention to anyone that she asked to be taken (but it did mention their language)

Nakia murdered 2 guards, starting the war. If that scene doesn't happen, Namor doesn't attack Wakanda. That was literally a declaration of war from Wakanda.

">	Marvel has always had more grounded heroes compared to DC. 

The Dark Knight trilogy renders this point moot, the transition out of the grounded, gritty Nolan era into Marvel escapism was a big point in culture. Marvel is not grounded, the entire world is chock full of superheroes and advanced tech and gods and monsters. Meanwhile DC is full of grounded and gritty. Just compare this years The Batman to any of the Marvel slate in the past few years. The only thing that comes close to grounded is Black Widow and it still ends with a physics defying set piece — which I thought was fun! But the franchise is not grounded. 

>	The fact DC makes it’s more colourful heroes more colourful does not automatically make them good. It just makes them colourful.

Also an absurd point. The Snyder era going alongside the MCU was always criticized for being too serious and dark. Marvel is so much lighter in comparison, and it’s why Aquaman was such a success — it emulates the MCU tone very well.  

>	The argument becomes laughable when you start factoring in Guardians of the Galaxy which is just as colourful as Aquaman if not more so, and yet no-one says Guardians is good because it’s colourful.

First off, Guardians 1 is not more colorful. Guardians 2 absolutely, but it is an exception to the MCU style. It’s not even about being colorful, it’s just about having good cinematography which Marvel almost universally is criticized for.

>	The trench sequence was beautiful…and it still put me to sleep. Literally. Black Panther builds the nation of Wakanda to a much deeper level than any of the nations in Aquaman.

The world building of Black Panther is again an exception to the MCU style, which is why that one got so much praise. But even then when you think of Wakanda and the Rhinos or the cliff side battle the poor VFX just kill the immersion even if the vision is there. But often there is no vision. In the MCU Ant-Man’s San Francisco looks and feels the same as Captain America’s Washington DC. The planets of Captain Marvel are so devoid of personality I can’t even remember their name. The skrulls or whatever they’re called have the same jokey demeanor as the people on the planet in Guardians 1 — again, can’t remember because it lacks personality. 

>	Both Marvel and DC make superhero movies. There’s only so much variation you can have in story from that genre. 

Sure, but the homogeneity is not really the point. And there’s tons and tons of variety outside the MCU — Batman Returns, Blade, Spider-Man, X-Men, Hellboy and Nolan’s Batman all came before the MCU and showcase far more variety and style than the MCU. 

>	Aquaman is just as generic and formulaic as anything Marvel puts out. 

My point was always that Aquaman is just a well done Marvel movie. If you think the MCU is formulaic and generic than of course you think Aquaman is. 

>	And as for humour, at least the MCU can be funny. Aquaman was just pure cringe.

This is subjective, but I’ve cringed FAR harder in MCU films. “What are those!” references and “he’s right behind me, isn’t he?” to “scooby-doo this crap”.  The MCU humor is very cringe. 

I’m not trying to convince you Aquaman is good. I’m just pointing out that in style and tone it is just like an MCU film, except the production value is much better. Pretty much none of the final battles in an MCU film since Avengers 1 have been on par with the big finale of Aquaman, including the final duel on the submarine. It’s pure comic book cheese and if you’re not into that then it makes sense, but for me Aquaman pretty much nails everything the MCU does on its best day.",2022-11-12 15:32:05

"Sorry, my bad, I meant DC superheroes have always been more colourful in the comics. They’re bigger, more bombastic, and often compared to gods. Batman is about as grounded and realistic as DC heroes get. Naturally the Nolan trilogy and Matt Reeves approach have both taking that to the Nth degree by making their Batman movies super grimy. As for Zack Snyder’s output, that says more about Snyder’s movies than it does about DC. Superman himself is still a very colourful and larger-than-life superhero. And let’s not forget how colourful the Wonder Woman movies were, or how cheesy the 90s Batman movies were (yes, including the Burton ones).

Compare that to Marvel who’s heroes are much more street-level. The most bombastic they get is with Thor and Eternals, and even then the Eternals were still depicted as relatively grounded and lacking the same level of bombast. The MCU has been jokey and lighthearted, to offset how much more ground-level the action is. (Another case in point, compare the action sequences in Snyder’s DC output to anything in the MCU, and they’re absolutely bigger, bolder, and more don’t-give-a-fuck).",2022-11-12 16:22:20

">Though Haitians declared their independence in 1804, the U.S. didn’t recognize Haiti as a country until 1862, enforcing a trade embargo.

>U.S. leaders also saw Haiti as an important military asset. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson considered annexing the island of Hispaniola, consisting of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, for strategic purposes. U.S. lawmakers worried that an unstable Haiti could be vulnerable to foreign intervention.

>**Between 1911 and 1915, the United States increased its involvement in the country to maintain its influence. As the State Department wrote in its history of U.S. foreign policy:**

> “Between 1911 and 1915, seven presidents were assassinated or overthrown in Haiti, increasing U.S. policymakers’ fear of foreign intervention. **In 1914, the Wilson administration sent U.S. Marines into Haiti. They removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank in December of 1914 for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank.”**

Do you think stealing money from Haitians is *not* a form of colonization? 

The US wants to keep control of Haiti. All of my sources indicate that. I have provided historical context for my opinion. 

Again, it is your turn. Show me something. Anything. If you believe so strongly that the US does not intend to continue exererting control over Haiti *as they've done for a century now,* then you should have evidence at the ready.
