Snow prob sometime in the near future: Yeah …so can we do away with the whole putting them in zoo cages and no showers/change of clothes  from when they are chosen to basically the games  ? They smell like literal shit.,2023-11-17

I do wish Hunters role as Tigris was bigger but that last line of you look just like your father was brutal.,2023-11-17
Would they have dropped the games if it wasn't for snow's manifesto on how to improve and make the game into a great spectacle since the viewers weren't interested?,2023-11-17

"As someone who didn’t read the books I genuinely thought Snow was going to shoot Lucy in the cabin. Good tension building. They did a good job of showing his descent into madness, despite the pacing issues.",2023-11-17
"The tributes looked like actual kids this time around, rather than casting adults to play children in the first hunger games. I think the only one that passed was Rue, and that was pretty intentional",2023-11-17
"I thought it was fantastic. Personally, the writing in *Ballad* is more sophisticated than the others, and that translates well enough to the screen.

I usually just read everyone's discussions on this subreddit, but the movie sat with me long enough to make me want to chip in. Random thoughts:

* Couldn't disagree more with complaints about pacing. The three act structure works really well for me. We expect stories to lead up to a giant, climactic conclusion and tie up loose ends with a quick scene or two. To me, that's less natural than what Ballad offers: a proportionate 'before, during, and after' the games. Each is important to Snow's development as a villain. The third act is frustrating because it's the ending to a tragedy.
* Speaking of Snow, I like how this story shows he is an unadulterated sociopath. You can empathize with his feelings -- his frustrations with Sejanus' unpragmatic attempts at benevolence, his care for Tigris and Grandmam, his affection for Lucy Gray -- but he only ever *acts* to use these people as fuel for his own goals. The book is more deliberate about that dissociation via the internal monologue, but the movie pulls it off too. There's no mistaking this guy for an anti-hero. He's a villain.
* Clean editing. Particularly liked the shot/reverse shot of Snow seeing Lucy Gray in the TV to the live reaping. There wasn't any filler. Movie couldn't have gone much longer anyway. It's already 2h38m.
* Production design was great. I don't remember what year these stories are meant to take place, but definitely seemed like a 1950s/60s Cold War style in the broadcast reminiscent of the real-life Golden Age of Television. The Capitol evokes that same era too, maybe more Soviet than America (cmon, look at that statue). If you go back and look at Hunger Games or Catching Fire, the Capitol architecture has become much more Fascist/Brutalist.
* Acting was great. Hunter Schafer looks perfect as Tigris; Jason kills the comedic relief (the throwaway line about the dinner reservation made me chuckle), and Viola Davis is terrifying. Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler had good chemistry, and even if her accent is a little questionable I thought Zegler did a great job bringing the songs to life.",2023-11-18
"Jason Schwartzman killed it as Flickerman.

I want him to make weather reports, especially now that David Lynch doesn't do them anymore.",2023-11-17
"A good albeit uneven movie

- World building was great! It was actually interesting to see how poorly the initial iterations were planned and executed
- Performances were great, especially Jason Schwartzman as Lucky Flickerman. Him doing weather reports in between the deaths were hilarious
- Lucy Gray was a compelling character. I can never tell if she's genuine or playing up to survive
- Deaths in the games felt more personal because of the enclosed area 
- 3rd act felt rushed and Snow made a 180 very quickly

Would love to see different Hunger Games prequels, specifically Haymitch Abernathy's.",2023-11-17
"After nearly a decade of everyone on this sub complaining about Mockingjay being a two-parter, the constant calls in this thread for Ballad to have been a two-parter as well are driving me insane, lol. I know for a fact you guys would be PISSED if they'd actually done the thing you're suggesting right now. You probably wouldn't have even bothered to see the first one if they'd split it into two parts. And there's not even a good place to split the movie either!

I feel like the studio head for The Itchy & Scratchy Show in that one Simpsons episode. ""You kids don't know what you want! That's why you're still kids -- 'cause you're stupid!""",2023-11-18
"I'm not a fan of how they changed/shortened the betrayal of Sejanus but of all the additions in the move I enjoyed Coryo calling his ass out for his privilege most. That he could afford to be reckless because of his father's influence, which was no longer a luxury provided to Snow. I did always think of Sejanus as sweetly stupid in his OBVIOUS rebellious actions but that added another layer to me as to why he felt he could almost openly be treasonous.",2023-11-17
"As a book reader (and one who considers this the best or second best of the four books) I understand the criticism that this book doesn’t translate well into a film. I think the driving force behind why I loved the book is the same thing that has it struggle as a film, which is Snow’s internal monologue. 

It is so intriguing how hypocritical his thoughts are and how he will in the same breath criticize someone and then do the same exact thing (but of course for him it’s okay). And the movie did an okay job showing that, but it definitely got lost in translation. Also just the juxtaposition of how charismatic he was externally but how toxic he was internally. 

Putting that aside, I have to say my biggest criticism was the cut of Ma. I think she should’ve been included. I also didn’t love how they condensed the mentor timeline to add more arena timeline and also how they had cameras in the tunnel. I get why they have to for a movie (the need for action), but I didn’t like it. 

I did love Flickerman though, he was so corny and great comic relief. I think Sejanus’s hanging was very well done, much better than how I imagined that scene when I read it.",2023-11-17
"Jason Schwartzman as the comic relief was perfect, because it wasn't like the marvel-y punch lines to lighten a dark moment, it was just an absurd narcissist saying wild things. It fit the world/narrative so well WHILE making me giggle to myself as children were dying.

On another note, the book was amazing but I really liked this more. Mostly due to Rachel Zegler's singing.....and Viola Davis being insane.....and Peter Dinklage just being perfect. Honestly, everything in this movie was great! Fantastic adaptation, the crew should be really proud!",2023-11-17

"I loved Lucius ""Lucky"" Flickerman, a man who needs no introduction, whose introduction of himself somehow gets longer every time we hear it.",2023-11-19
"Read the book when it came out and really enjoyed it.

Few thoughts on the movie:

-Everything up through Snow becoming a Peacekeeper felt really long, everything after felt really rushed.  Snow descending into madness needed more time.  

-Lucy's accent was just...distracting. They should have dropped that early on.

-For the most part, the movie felt and looked like I imagined the book while I was reading.  

I generally liked it, but I think it sorta suffered from similar issues at the Mockingjay movies-not spending enough time getting into the head of the main character to really understand what they were going through.",2023-11-17
"I really just wished they did something about his internal monologues. It would’ve shown perfectly that there was no transition from hero to villain. He’s always been narcissistic, and in every scenario, it’s just him finding a reason to justify what he did, especially the ending - Hunger Games must continue because it’s a reminder of who we are aka it showed me I am horrible so then everyone must be horrible too.",2023-11-17
"""You look just like your father"" 

Such a cold, seething line. Really solidified Snow's descent for me.",2023-11-21
Am I the only one who thought Snow had mercy on Lucy Gray when he gave her rat poison? I thought he gave it to her to kill herself as the last resort since she had a very low chance to survive💀,2023-11-18

I'd never seen Viola Davis in a role quite like this and she was AMAZING.,2023-11-18
"This movie kind of slayed but I’m a sucker for this series and the teen dystopian novel era.

My friend who I saw it with pointed out that later on Snow hates Katniss so much because she reminds him of Lucy Gray. The little curtsy/bow was even the same!!! I haven’t read this book yet but I plan to now, didn’t even know a prequel had come out until the movie trailer dropped lol",2023-11-17
The movie was better than I expected. Tom Blyth was superb!,2023-11-18
"Stripping away the sci-fi technology and pageantry from the first Hunger Games movie really emphasizes the brutality of the Capitol and the games much more effectively here.

Overall, I thought it was a great movie though with some pacing issues near the end, but the performances in this movie slapped. Though I wouldn't have expected anything less from Viola Davis, Tom Blyth as snow was the perfect choice.",2023-11-19

Anybody else hope when they showed his face staring into the camera at the end that it was going to morph into the old Snow?,2023-11-17
"You know it's a good movie when it haunts you. I watched it and I've been thinking about it all day. All the complex characters and their relations and motives, wow. The movie felt really realistic and Suzanne Collins really is a mastermind for coming up with believable explanations on how the games changed overtime.",2023-11-18
"It seems to me that lucy’s intent was never to kill snow. She set it up in a way so that he would think she’s trying to kill him so he would not have to choose between her/the outdoor lifestyle, and his capital life/family/power. if he’s under the impression she wants him dead, he has no reason to stay. Essentially she gives him an easy way out because she did love him. This also gives her time to escape from him who is clearly unstable and no longer trustworthy. 

The snake under the scarf (assuming it wasn’t there by coincidence) is also a test to see how he would react. Had he been calmer instead of trying to shoot her, she may have considered staying or talking it out. 

I think most likely it was both, as even if snow failed her test, which he did, she wouldn’t resort to murder again like snow does so easily (snow is projecting his readiness to kill).",2023-11-21
"I should preface by saying I've never read the book and went into it blind

For a moment, I was worried Lucy Grey would get pregnant without telling Snow and we would find out that Katniss was related to Snow this entire time, especially after she mentioned the plant.

Also, it's no wonder why Snow was so rattled when Katniss sang the Hanging Tree in those propos. Was it just me, or when Lucy Grey was singing it was blended with Jennifer Lawrence's voice? I swear it sounded super similar,",2023-11-17

"I like how the rules were lax and the technology was pretty primitive in those days. 

* District residents could mix with Peacemakers in buildings.
* It was easier to escape. (I'd like to believe Lucy escaped).
* Residents had more freedom to do activities. eg. go swimming in the lake. 

And then, of course, Snow had to come along...",2023-11-22
"When Snow pitched all his ideas for the revamped games, he ultimately caused his own downfall by giving Katniss a platform to rally Panem during her games",2023-11-18
I actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit. I had read the 3rd act wasn’t good but I didn’t have an issue with it. If it had been made into a two parter a lot more people would have complained that part would have sucked. It would have faired worse than Mockinjay part 2. I think it was the better move to keep it as one movie overall.,2023-11-17
"The whole time watching the movie, I kept wanting to know what happened between Coriolanus and Tigris. 

The first time I ever seen Viola Davis having a blast in her performance. She's usually in heavy drama and this is really not something we get to see her in often. 

Also, in the 3rd act, Rachel Zegler keep pronouncing Coriolanus, Cornelius instead. that really bugs me. 

Overall, it's a great movie. I really enjoyed it and makes me want to read the book.",2023-11-18

"Hunger Games: The Musical.


No seriously, Rachel Zegler just bust out in song like a dozen times. I started rolling my eyes by the latter half of them. They really could have cut some of that out. 


Also I don't believe that was Tom Blyth in the third act, it was Eminem from 1999 who time traveled to star in this movie",2023-11-17
"Man I literally cried when that tribute carried all the bodies of the fallen and covered them from the capitals view. I wonder how many other contestants did other little acts of defiance but it wasn't televised. 

I thought the movie was brilliant. I didn’t read the book, but I could easily fallow Snows descent into Madness. The violence felt very heavy despite not seeing any blood. Especially the cries of the bird near the hanging tree. 


I loved Lucy Greys character, accent and all.",2023-11-18
"I am curious how people will perceive sejanus on reddit. I personally like him but if people view him as flailing and naive and does not use his privilege in an effective way. 

That aside I do think they made a point of making a lot of the tributes even more tragic this time. Granted they felt less defined than in other ones. But so many of them look younger than 16. They look constantly dirty and or sick or injured way more than any of the previous movies. That little girl had to be younger than 14. 

I’m not sure how audiences will view a young snow. If they did too much to make him sympathetic for me that goes out the window with how he treats sejanus one of his few close friends who now I wonder if he was friends with him at all. 

Also I’m not sure about anyone else but he existence of the covey these music base traveller group makes district 12 fate in the future movies even more tragic. Whether it was by snows had or not but the complete destruction of literally the last ray of light in this community. The destruction of the culture. Like this is one of the only times and places in the franchise where people are happy in the district by katniss era they are so beaten down they just work to survive with countless constantly starving. It makes me sick. 

Like others have said or will say this should have been like a 4-6 limited series",2023-11-17
I swear Rachel Zegler's accent vanished for the middle hour of the movie.,2023-11-17
"I read the book several times.  Just got back from the movie and loved it.  I was aware of the changes that were made between the two, but this is one time when I think the changes were necessary and actually made the movie better.  They consolidated certain things so they flowed better, and they sped up the third act, which really dragged in the book.  The games also moved a bit more quickly, which worked as well.  

The scene where >!Lucy wins the games!< was AMAZING.  And so much better than the book, in which it is fairly anti-climactic.  I feel like I would go back and watch it again just to see that scene.  

Much like in the book, you understand why Snow becomes what he becomes, but he still isn't completely sympathetic.  Tom Blyth did a great job.  All of the actors did, really.  Viola Davis was amazing.  I'm sure people will pick this movie apart and trash it, but as a big fan of all of the books, I thought this was a fantastic adaptation.",2023-11-18
Love the range of diverse tributes this time around,2023-11-17
I loved how they made (Janis ?) a sort of face value protester like he cared but only the righteous parts the dark part of what changed involved was not something he assumed he very much was a person who loved to play rebel but knew he had mom and daddy as a safety net . In his last moments with the other rebels they stood stoic but he pleaded the entire even his last words calling for his mother.,2023-11-17
"I just got out, movie was fantastic to me. Granted I didn’t read the books but I like how dark it was. And the retro aspect. Like no fancy arena and drones.",2023-11-20
"The scene in the cabin was intense as fuck. I love how Lucy catches on quick that something was off with Snow.

“The world changes awfully fast.”

Goddamn, I like how they made another strong female character without having to resort to Katniss clone who fights good.",2023-11-20
How was this movie simultaneously so long and yet so rushed? Mind-boggling that they didn’t make this at least two parts.,2023-11-17
"Really enjoyed it as a book reader, but I've never felt the limitations of a 12A/PG-13 rating more in a movie. The scene where a mentor gets stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle and there is zero blood was borderline comical. Understand why but wish they could have pushed for a higher age rating. Also the mainline Hunger Games movie did a much better job working within the limits.",2023-11-17
"I enjoyed it but did anyone else confused with the voice recording at the hanging? I hadn’t read the book, but it sounded like they played Snow and Plinth talking, so when Lucy didn’t understand why Snow said he killed 3 people I had no idea wtf was going on. I assumed she already knew.  
I feel like that could’ve been conveyed better as it is really important to understand his deception to Lucy. It’s the big turning point in their relationship.  
Snow murdering that woman in cold blood earlier on was also rushed over I think. Everyone’s reactions just seemed strange, and they all just accepted it.  
  
Just my nitpicks, I still thought this movie was great.",2023-11-17
"This movie is REALLY great. The theater cheered at the end. Great casting, acting, sets, story (based off of a book of course), and worldbuilding..... just to find out it received mediocre reviews? What gives? I'm no movie critic but this was a very good film.

The main character does show a real life hypocrite attitude by criticizing others for their wrongdoing, and then does the same behind their backs. I love that side to him. I wish we got more out of his crazy mind since I can't imagine this movie's character becoming the Snow from the original books. His character does show a lot of innocence, but then can be cruel a minute later, which didn't really chime with me. That's my only criticism but very good character overall. 

Will there be another one or is this it for a prequel?",2023-11-17
"I have read the book and now seen the movie and I think Snow is a different character in the two of them. 

In the book, his thoughts are hypocritical all throughout. He does truly care about Lucy Gray, but the prize stays above everything. However, you can still see his motives and how the world has shaped him to be the way he is.

In the movie, possibly due to the lack of internal monologue, I found myself rooting for him in the beginning. Though it may have only been because he was a good liar, he seemed to really care at first. There were hints, such as his hesitation at Lucy Gray’s kiss and when he was asked if he’d support her even if there was no prize, but the acting made it seem like he wanted her to live. I feel that this made his descent into madness more sad. Rather than me hating him due to good writing, I felt bad for him. Rather than coming into the story with him broken, and seeing the story with his broken morals, I felt that I was watching him break.

Both the book and the movie left me thinking. It has been a few years since I read the book, and I think it’s time for a reread. I preferred the book to the original series, and I think that may be true for the film adaptation as well. I think as long as they are well written, movies about broken people will resonate more with me than those about brave heroes.

Tom Blyth’s portrayal of Snow and his descent into madness was very well done. I liked the costuming as well. It’s not something I normally notice, but the hairstyles seemed thought out, especially for Snow. He starts out with the loose curly hair when he’s closest to being likeable, then gets a buzz cut when he’s forced to straighten up, and ends the movie with a haircut I’m not sure what to call but one that definitely fits the character he ends as.",2023-11-19
"There was an incredible shot when Snow was talking to Lucy in the tunnel in Act 3.

Snow’s face was covered in darkness despite having a bright background. And Lucy’s face was illunimiated while having the dark tunnel behind her.

Lucy tries to bring light to the darkness while Snow infects the light with darkness.",2023-11-19
"Such a good movie omg. Easily my favorite hunger games movie. It’s dark & gritty. You really empathize with the tributes this time around. Hard disagree on people saying the movie should’ve been two parts— for what? Just like with Mockingjay, by the time the second part comes out, you have to recaptivate everyone’s attention. It was easier with Mockingjay but this was the return of the Hunger Games universe & probably wouldn’t have worked as well with audiences. Also, this movie being split up would’ve messed with Coriolanus’ descent into evil as we saw it unravel piece by piece in the film. I would’ve loved the movie to be a little longer but had no problems with the pacing & storytelling. Hoping we get the 4 hour directors cut soon.",2023-11-22
"You know. It wasn’t bad….

But it kept going after the games, and I wasn’t as into that. Not to mention, for a movie as long as this was, the ending felt very rushed. I felt Coriolanus’s turn was pretty out of nowhere and unearned. I didn’t leave with a feeling that he earned that epiphany at the end.",2023-11-17
"I have a lot of criticisms, such as:
- the one everyone will mention, the pacing and lengthiness
- the odd accents (Tom Blyth was trying to keep that American going and Rachel Zegler’s voice was… ummmm)
- the lack of visual craft in comparison to the original series; watched Catching Fire again when I got home from this and it was so beautiful and visually striking compared to this movie.
- the overuse of music; I have read the book and I understand that these songs were included there, but in a movie where much else is cut out, we did not have time to include all of these songs and keep the movie going imo
- clunky dialogue; we started off bad with “you’re the best cousin” to Tigris and we had some other pretty bad lines in there
- Sejanus. My boyfriend watched this as someone who hadn’t read the book and was able to boil down the issues with his character to a simple statement; “he was just boring”. Sejanus is really just a foil with more screen time than he deserved in this movie, which was disappointing compared to his character in the book. I found my mind wandering whenever he was on screen.

Yet still, with all of these critiques and more, something just worked for me here. I think that a lot of it came down to Blyth and Davis’s performances, which both elevated and exceeded the material, and Blyth and Zegler’s chemistry. The film has a bunch of interesting ideas that it doesn’t really flesh out; the book had a similar problem, but it was lessened in a lengthy novel, whereas it was exacerbated in the film with the constraint of screen time. 

I think a lot of the film’s strength comes down to the solidity of its lore. We as an audience know Panem, we know Katniss, and we know how the games work. The film recognizes that it’s a prequel quite well and uses this to its advantage; much of the movie spends its time explaining how the Hunger Games that we know came to be, with its excess and its showmanship. It does the same with Snow’s character; the 2.5 hours successfully turns a charismatic, empathetic young man into a now-iconic literary villain, and it just feels entertaining on a very basic level.

I don’t think it’ll reach the classic status of the original movies, but it’s something that I’d rewatch on a flight or on a rainy day. It may not successfully start a new franchise as a lot of world-expansions aim to, but that doesn’t feel like the goal here; the goal seems to be to explain and expand the Hunger Games world, and it does that quite successfully. It didn’t leave me wanting another film with these characters, but I’d love some more content from this world if it’s able to match this quality consistently.",2023-11-17
"the structure of this movie reminded me of full metal jacket. this absolutely would have bombed if they split it into two parts that's a dumb idea.

also Josh Andres Rivera is a dead ringer for a young Vincent D'Onofrio change my mind",2023-11-18
"I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Nuanced storytelling, complex characters, and maybe it's just me but emotionally-charged despite the limited screentime for some of the cast. Everyone brought their best here; not a single weak performance to be found. I was gripped the entire runtime and never felt an ounce of boredom. I just wish they went the extra mile and gone a full three hours for the sake of the last act, but I'm still very pleased.

I truly think this is leagues above the other four Hunger Games films.",2023-11-17
"Random thoughts:

- Don't understand the mixed reactions at all, to me this was the best hunger games movie by a wide margin.

- The pacing was up and down but the plot was so engaging that I never felt like the movie lost me with it's pacing. 

- The main actors were all good, Snow and Lucy Grey especially killed it. Wayyyyyy better than those wet paper bags Peeta and Gale. 

- Those mockingjay screams after each execution will haunt me all night. Totally wasn't expecting that.

- I would've appreciated some time cut from the games to focus on the third act.

- People say it came out of nowhere but to me, Snows turn was pretty well communicated. He got given 2 opportunities to start a new life and join a cause he thought he supported (joining the rebels and/or running away with Lucy Grey), but when push came to shove he chose his personal gains over both. 

- Lucy Grey was an absolutely fascinating character to watch. She was never the symbol of purity and straight as arrow (heh) moral compas that Katniss was. She clearly had a dark and manipulative side to her since the very beginning and it became more and more evident by the end. She doesn't even flinch when Snow kills Mayfair, or when he lets Spruce take the fall for the murders. She only gets alarmed after seeing Snow also sell his best friend out, which means she will never be safe with him, hence the stone cold betrayal at the end.

- This worked so well as a single movie. Would've had nowhere near the level of excitement and pull if it was spread over a TV show or two movies.

- The idea of a sequel is farfetched but I want one so bad. Snow's arc seems pretty complete but I desperately want to see more of Lucy Grey.",2023-11-18
Should have been a mini series. But all the actors did fantastic. The cinematography was well done. You could tell that the director used different framing intentionally. Highly recommend if you liked the series before.,2023-11-17
"I noticed the Capital is not yet very extravagant. They seem to be eating what we might call ""normal"" food and almost no one is wearing excessive make-up. Does the book go into detail about that difference vs. how the Capital is portrayed laster in the timeline?",2023-11-19
The Down syndrome tribute broke my heart so much. She was oblivious to what was going on and she lasted so long as well. I wonder if the other tributes let her live out of sympathy. I can’t imagine it being me and her and making the decision to kill her.,2023-11-21
"I liked the movie, it's a welcome return to the surprisingly decent Hunger Games series of movies, which is better than most YA adaptations, the other IMO being The Maze Runner trilogy.

That said, Act III feels hella rushed. Snow's change from a broken human being to a cold sociopath because he killed the three men (the last one is directly by his choice and his conscience even) and Lucy Gray left him felt abrupt and sudden. Feels like the things we see in the Games should be the climax while Snow's slow change should be pushed to the second movie. Felt like them adapting the book in 1 movie, when it has such a dense story is a mistake.

Also, this movie is also partially a musical. Not really a fan of musicals in general, but they surprisingly made it work here, I didn't feel like cringing when hearing these songs. Love the backstory of The Hanging Tree tying very neatly to Snow's decent, had a feeling it would go viral again the same way it was 10 years ago.",2023-11-17
"The reports from test screenings earlier this year claim this film was around 3 hours long, and after watching it i really wish they would have just left it alone instead of cutting out a bunch of scenes. They should have just committed to a 3 hour epic if they were so adamant in not splitting the book in two. 

I felt like everything was rushed even before the third act. There was no room for the characters to breathe and they cut out too much from the book in my opinion. 

In saying that, all the performances were great. The casting for this franchise has always been top notch. The production design was fantastic as well. I really hope they release a longer cut with the physical release. This film could have been great.",2023-11-19
"Didn't read the book and my initial impression of the trailer was ""why do we need this"", but I really enjoyed getting the backstory and expansion of the lore. 

Honestly it felt really bittersweet that Snow and Lucy may have ended up together but in the high pressure situations they were thrust into, they couldn't shake the lingering thought that they each had ulterior motives.

I guess I'm more invested in the story of panem than I previously thought. Wouldn't be upset if we get more movies leading to the timeline of the original film.",2023-11-19
Those first two parts were just Amazing. I was fully into it. The World building was so interesting and I just loved everything going on. That third part slows down to a crawl and becomes a very different movie. Brings the score down for me but that ending mostly made UP for it. Best hunger games film ever for me,2023-11-17
I enjoyed it! Tom’s acting was great and the songs were awesome. I laughed at “tuberculosis on legs”,2023-11-18
"I haven’t read the book so forgive me if im wrong.

One detail I like is that throughout the film, it was unclear whether Lucy Gray was acting out of love or survival. We are strictly looking at it through Snow’s POV so a lot of it is romanticism but I felt like there were hints she was more pragmatic and self-aware than she acted.

Great performance.",2023-11-20
"I just got out of a showing of this and I have to say it was spectacular. I read and watched the original series however I had not read this book.  I am someone who watches a ton of movies (I love letterboxd) and work in the industry.  I did not watch the trailer for this, I haven't watched trailers in about 5 years now and it makes movies 1000x more enjoyable. 

  
I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  It had wonderful easter eggs for the original films but it held it's own.  My only gripe was the opening scene, I wanted the moment they were behind the statue to last much longer to really show the violence of what was happening. 

  
Acting was superb by the whole cast with a huge shout out to the three leads, Zegler, Blyth and Davis were remarkable. Soundtrack was phenomenal, mixing was wonderful, production and costume design was superb, just like the originals.  There were some gorgeous shots in this film, really wonderful lighting and overall cinematography. 

I was blown away by it, I truly loved it.  In fact my only criticism was I wish we had another 20-30 minutes in act 3 (literally defined in the movie), there was quite a rush at the end and I think having a bit more time to let Blyth really expand on Snow's personality change would have done wonders. 

  
Really no complaints, loved it, go watch it.",2023-11-17
"As a non-book reader, and maybe I'm just totally stupid/oblivious, but someone please enlighten me: Why did Lucy Gray run away from Snow?  Was she just pissed that he lied (as she said trust was most important to her earlier...even over love) about how many people he had killed?  Was she afraid of him?  That part totally lost me.  I was sitting in the theatre scratching my head in the third act.
I mean, the dude literally risked his entire life to be with her.",2023-11-17
"I thought this was better than two of the original Hunger Games movies. I was completely taken by surprise by how layered and nuanced this movie was, right up until Snow's transformation. I thought that was a bit rushed, but overall, I was pleasantly surprised and damn, this was a good movie.

On another note, did anyone get a little unnerved by how close this mirrors the Israel-Hamas-Palenstine situation. At one point, you would have thought that this movie was a direct allegory. freaky shit.",2023-11-17

"Thought I’d really enjoy this being a somewhat casual/obsessed fan after initially watching the first movie when it came out, then reading all the books, and loving the rest of the film series but not really going back to it much afterwards. 

I didn’t expect to love it and re-ignite my affinity to the world Collins built. I don’t read at all anymore (👎I know lol) so I doubt I’ll be reading this one’s book, but I’m already starting an entire rewatch and hoping Collins pushes out more books (if she hasn’t already) and the films eventually follow",2023-11-17

Excellent movie. Had no right to be as mature and awesome as it was. Didn’t feel like a YA movie 🎥",2023-11-19
"Loved the movie. The first singing threw me off tho (when Lucy gets called for the Hunger Games). My wife asked me if it was going to be a musical. 

The actor playing Snow reminded me of Paul Walker mixed with Freddie Prinze Jr. mixed with Hayden Christensen, but a better actor than all of them.

Can someone explain why Lysistrata agreed to send water to her own tribute, knowing that the rabies made him afraid of water? Maybe I’m misunderstanding the scene. Did she feel like Jessup was already beyond saving, so Snow convinced her to help Lucy instead?",2023-11-20
"Seeing a lot of comments about Snow always having been a sociopath but I’m not sure I feel that’s the case? Did not read this book though so maybe it’s more the case there. I thought Snow being a complicated protagonist was what made the whole movie, I thought he was a great main character. 

Obviously by the end he’s fallen to the dark side but I felt like it was a gradual descent marked by a few major events and people. He does care and love his family, and I do believe he loved Lucy, or at least the idea of her. I think he cared for Sejanus as well. I mean breaking news here, sociopaths don’t cry from guilt and loss alone in private. They just don’t. 

I think Lucy actually may be closer to what we define as a sociopath. I didn’t feel that anything she did the entire movie was genuine. I think she was a well rehearsed act from the moment she was reaped, and very likely even before that. I think she did everything she needed to in order to survive, and I think Snow was never someone she actually cared for. I think even saving his life was strategic, and only made when she calculated correctly that she wouldn’t make it in an escape. She wears a mask the whole film and I’m not sure we ever see it lifted, except briefly when she floats the idea that she could ruin him with a word. 

Highbottom was also obviously a major catalyst in pushing Snow to what he became. Classic tragedy of great intentions, but his actions directly created Snow and his own demise. Had he at any point tried to see Snow as something other than the son of his enemy his whole arc could have potentially been avoided. I genuinely think had Snow gotten that prize Day 1, he doesn’t become the President Snow we know. 


Not to say he’s a good guy. His seeds were always there for selfishness, arrogance and violence. But I disagree that he’s a sociopath and I do think his descent could have been avoided.",2023-11-21
"Just a thought.  Snows experience in the woods with Lucy would be why he eventually makes the forrest ""off limits."" Taking away the one good thing they had living in district 12- the reason Lucy wanted to stay there.",2023-11-27
"As another comment mentioned, I really don’t think we need more of these split-part movies, and I’m glad we got a fully formed narrative here, even though I think this one would’ve been better suited as a miniseries. 

Songbirds and Snakes: Part One would’ve been portraying Snow as too sympathetic and as the clear hero, while Part Two would veer too far the opposite direction, when his characterisation is more layered than that, and I think they did a decent job with him given the lack of an internal monologue you could get from the book. However, that might be more of a credit to Tom Blyth’s performance than the script.",2023-11-17
"I absolutely adored the movie. 

It has some pacing issues like the book but overall has excellent acting, a gripping story & beautiful visuals.

I’m hoping I can catch again on the big screen in next couple of weeks, well worth the return to Panem!",2023-11-18

"I forgot how dark these movies were. As a casual fan of the earlier films, I had no expectations going into this and enjoyed it for the spectacle it was. Rachel Zegler was lovely as Lucy Gray, as were all her folk songs (I forgot how good her voice was). I was definitely rooting for Snow and Lucy throughout, so it's not exactly how I expected it would turn out. (Is it possible Snow was being paranoid and Lucy had accidentally dropped his mother's scarf while a snake just happened to be under there?) Lucy is such a mysterious character that you never really get to know throughout, which in turn makes it all the more mysterious that we never find out her fate beyond this movie.",2023-11-21

"I was skeptical about it being a 2.5 hour-long film, but it didn't feel excruciatingly long to me and I'd easily take this over a Part 1 and Part 2 after Mockingjay. The film did a great job showing Snow's fall to darkness, and the tone is consistent with the original trilogy, the production design and costumes really sell the setting as a vintage version of Panem. Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth turn in fantastic, complex performances and chemistry here. I didn't read the book, so the build in tension really made me had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen as Coryo and Lucy Gray went into the woods.",2023-11-22

"I personally don't mind not knowing what happened to Lucy at the end - imo this was Snow's story, not hers. 

The singing was not bad, but it also felt out of place in the first half. I could see the guy next to me whip out his phone the moment Lucy started singing during the Reaping - it felt like a Disney moment.

A very good experience overall, 9/10",2023-11-18

Not as good as catching fire or hunger games but better than both mockingjays imo.  Solid and good movie.  Tom blythe was good as he'll and performances were good.  Surprised this felt more in tone like mockingjay and grittier than that of catching fire.  Way darker than expected but was good.  I can see how some critics didn't like it though,2023-11-19

"This definitely felt like it should have either been a two-parter or a mini series. I liked the movie, but it felt as if they adapted the SparkNotes rather than the book itself. They cut a *lot* of stuff from the book. But the stuff they kept in was very well done.

On the plus side, I really liked all of the performances—excellent casting—and the worldbuilding.",2023-11-17

But just what everyone is saying, last act was rushed. It could have ended when the games ended. 

My favorite character is the cousin though. She just exudes the kindness and purity and serves as an anchor to Snow. Her last line of “I think you look just like your father” was perfectly delivered.",2023-11-19

"Why was the main girl plucked from a Disney movie bad outfit and all forced to have a inconsistent southern accent? And the singing? Please....Katniss's song was iconic because of the context and how Jennifer Lawrence couldn't really sing.

It's like her character was transported from another universe that had nothing to do with the movie.",2023-12-25
"I can totally see why people were saying it should've been split into two. However, I would have liked to see it split right in the middle of the 10th Hunger Games if that were the case. Too much of the mentor interaction was cut as is - the extra running time would have given some space to breathe if the latter part of the action was pushed over to the second movie. Also, the third arc (peacekeeper) would probably have felt dragged out if it were given a standalone treatment.

That being said, as a book reader I'm satisfied with this adaptation despite its flaws. The retro-futuristic, not-quite-recovered image of the Capitol is just like how I imagined it, and the action in the arena was intense.",2023-11-17
I liked the first two thirds of this movie. Not so much the last third.,2023-11-18
"“Enjoy to the show” and the jabber jays is hella sinister and ominous. I feel like, and I haven’t read the books, or watched the other movies in a while; Snow is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. I think he understood something that made him know to stay in line and play the part so that one day he could have the right conditions again to permanently bring peace. It had to come from the people uniting themselves. 

Plutarch and Snow went to school together, and Snow notices everything. He knew what he was doing when bringing on Plutarch in the later movies. 

He hated district 12 because of what it meant to him, not Katniss. But he saw the opportunity to make things right like he should have when he started. 

He knew how to play the part and to use his money and status to one day make the permanent change.

Again- I have not read the books or re-watched the movies. Just my take from watching it with little prior knowledge",2023-11-19

"It was hit a little harder in the book, but I like how Gaul is just seeing what she wants to in the games. Every time people are given a choice, even in the arena, they choose to help each other. 

They become animals and kill each other when you make them, yeah, or if you convince them it's the only way. See how quickly even the ringleader of the gang broke when she saw that the killimg was for nothing. She had strangled the human inside her, just like snow does at the end. But he never has to face that lie cause it works, and dies laughing 65 years later because that kind of cold blooded pragmatism is still being chosen by those in power after the second war.",2023-11-27
"Great movie man. I think this was very well directed and although a lot happens, except for a rushed 3rd act, it was paced really well. First of all, credit to the storytelling. I was engaged throughout and very early you do feel for both the leads. There was definitely good chemistry between the leads and both Blyth and Zegler were brilliant throughout. You are thoroughly invested whether they end up together or not in the end. The other characters were fine too, particularly elevated by the actors such as Dinklage and Davis.

The visuals and score were competent. It does feel like a big movie despite having a reasonable budget of 100m. More studios should take note on budget efficiency.

The games themselves were not as interesting as in the OG series but there were enough memorable moments. The scene where one of the tributes carries all the fallen tributes and places them in the centre and lays the flag of Panem on top of them was excellently done.

Collins has a fantastic grasp on creating complex lead characters and it is the same here. Snow is easy to root for the most part. Blyth's charm helps but you also see how he is fighting against many odds to re-lift his family to their past glory. It's the ambition in him to become successful in the den of snakes which is the Capitol, which does not seem evil at least before part 3 begins, which drives him. Whereas for Lucy, she just wants to survive and live life having been dealt an unfair hand by being chosen as a tribute.

But things get interesting when both the leads fall for each other. You are left questioning whether they really are in love indeed were they just trying to gain advantage from the other. Like it is easy to see why Snow helps Lucy and is keen to see her win as his eyes are on the plinth prize which will get him a seat at the university. Whereas Lucy relies on Snow as a lone source of help in the dangerous Capitol and for the games too. But by the end of part 2 you are left convinced that they indeed had something real between them. Lucy does save Snow after the explosion in the arena whereas she could have run away. And for his part Snow is genuinely concerned for her safety when the games end.

In part 3 shit starts to fall apart. I think it is funny how it's Snow who is the one on the lookout for Lucy which is why he bargains to be sent to D12. Whereas while Lucy is happy to see him, it does seem she has moved on comfortably back to her new life. Snow at this point seems more concerned with Lucy than her with him. Even after first seeing each other, it is Snow once again who searches for her and finds her in the woods. I do feel at this point Snow has real love for her. Whereas Lucy does not seem too into him. However, once Snow sees a way out back to the Capitol and a chance to redeem himself, his ambitions take precedence over his love. While this does paint him wrong, one has to see that these ambitions have been in his head since forever. 

I do feel that Snow still values Lucy and wants to take her back to the Capitol. But it is Lucy's fragile love for Snow which immediately makes her question him and the relationship. In the lakehouse I feel Snow would not have harmed Lucy until she raised the possibility that she is the last loose end. That is when his ambitions take over because Lucy can POSSIBILY be a threat to his long lasting dream.

As for Lucy, it is understandable why she would be wary of Snow. Firstly, he is not being 100% truthful to her. And she realizes that for his ambitions he got his close friend of old killed so why is she special?

The love story has a hint of tragedy tbh. Things change instantly with a few accidentally uttered sentences which plant the seed of mistrust between the two. It does show that their romance was fragile and in its budding stages and perhaps neither was fully committed to the other.

This feeds into the main theme of the movie that the Hunger Games exist to represent the true, violent & selfish nature of humans. Snow and Lucy had something beautiful in the making but slight missteps cause it all to crumble and fall apart. Great story tbh and Snow & Lucy's relationship is a memorable one particularly how it continues to affect Snow decades later too as we see in the OG series.

"The depth, poignance, and sincerity of the Hunger Games franchise that came through so strongly in the original films was lost in this movie. In fact, the best part of this movie was the renewed appreciation it gave me for the original movies.

There is solid commentary on fascism and the personal battle between good and evil in the film, but the style of delivery was so far from the mark that I can't really buy in to the messaging. 

First of all, we've got Lucy Gray. Maybe it's because I didn't read the book, but her character comes across so flagrantly inhuman and doused in protagonist syndrome that it makes the movie nearly unwatchable. Where the Hunger Games shows victors coping with the trauma of their victory, the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes shows Lucy Gray back to her honkytonk performances with zero indication of any emotional impacts from the games.

Then, we've got the cheesy boarding school vibe of it all. There's an quality of gossip girledness injected into the capitol schoolmates. This upper echelon attitude strays from the flamboyantness of ""Effy"" and is so literal that I would bet the term ""daddy's money"" was used at least 3 times. There is no subtlety in the betrayal of privilege in this film, it is a perfect example of ""tell, not show"".

The actual Hunger Games in the film felt low stakes. The scene of the reaping in the original Hunger Games was so poignant. This reaping, however, felt goofy. Lucy Gray's reaction did not match the magnitude of the horror at hand. In fact, her reaction was so cloyingly juvenile it made me wonder if this book (and therefore movie) were meant to act as a booster to get younger kids in the door of the main franchise. Something about the juvenile framing of the film makes it even more confusing to watch, given the quantity of violence (I would even say body horror?), death, and discussions of fascism. Maybe kids today are more clued into political commentary, idk. 

Again, the games centered on a nearly perfect protagonist who was unable to kill unless morally justifiable. This makes the games hard to watch. Beyond Lucy Gray, the named tributes were given little depth or consideration. The original Hunger Games series does such a great job world building the tributes beyond district 12, but in this film it just fell flat. All in all each tribute could've been summarized by a single word like one of the 7 dwarves (sneezy, stabby, sobby, etc). I was particularly baffled by the decision to include a tribute with Down Syndrome, frame her as a Rue-like character, and then have the character have no interactions with other tributes and ultimately>!be overtaken by snakes!<.

In the end, this movie wasn't bad as a standalone. The issue is that it's supposed to exist in conversation with the original Hunger Games. The original series did such a phenomenal job world/mood building that the obvious flaws of this film stick out like a sore thumb",2023-12-12
"I haven't read the book, and what I gather from other comments is that a lot of the richness of Snow's character is lost in the film.

That tracks, as my biggest complaint is that Snow's motivations and his descent into darkness seems incredibly rapid in the third act. Obviously, in the first two acts, we see the battle of good and evil within him play out - but in the third there doesn't really seem to be anything that *sparks* his rapid and sudden change into a purely sociopathic killer. It just kinda happens. I'm not saying it's inconsistent with his character - it isn't - but the way it's handled is pretty abupt and shallow.

Other than that, fun movie!",2023-11-17
"Surprised at the mixed reviews. I was enthralled the whole movie with the exception of Plinth Sejanus' scenes. Really did not like that character. I'm also usually a big stickler for pacing however I felt this was done appropriately and laugh at those saying it should've been two parts. 

Lucy Gray's accent was jarring at first, I have not read the books and did not expect it at all, but got used to it quickly and really enjoyed the portrayal. Her use of the snake on Mayfair at the reaping was a good indicator of her character's depth, in my opinion foreshadowing that her trust in Snow was possibly a facade to understandably survive. Maybe there was a genuine connection, but ultimately she didn't like what he had done, even if in Snow's perspective it was all for family/survival. 

Left me wanting more from this universe. I honestly could do without scenes of the Games, I really love the world building so much more.",2023-11-20
"This movie wasn’t great. The pacing was super weird, Snow’s decent into madness felt incredibly rushed at the end. The movie didn’t earn the ending it had because it never really took the time to show us Snow’s transformation, which was really disappointing. It’s also just too long, probably would have worked better as a miniseries. 

Lucy Gray annoyed the shit out of me. The over-the-top southern accent, the constant singing, the fact that she was able to win the hunger games despite never once picking up a weapon. Made scenes with her really hard to watch, imo. The actress is also super theatrical, which isn’t bad in certain contexts, but definitely didn’t work for this character. 

The dialogue is stiff. Part of it is the way that lines are delivered, but I think most of it is just that the script isn’t great. Characters have conversations that don’t feel like the way that humans naturally talk, especially Snow’s schoolmate who gets killed by the tribute in the beginning. Most of her lines felt straight out of a middle schooler’s AO3 account. 

Snow had way more chemistry with Serjanus than with Lucy Gray. 
Also, Snow looked exactly like Eminem when he got his hair cut.

"Would have been better as a mini series. I liked the book but the film moved at a breakneck pace from scene to scene with little room to explore characters’ relationships or motivations. 

My partner who hadn’t read the book found the transitions between acts jarring (especially beginning of act 3) and didn’t understand Coriolanus’ decisions because his internal dialogue was missing. 

You wouldn’t know that Coriolanus never liked Sejanus unless you’d read the book.",2023-11-18

"What an odd movie. All over the place tonally, and I thought the way in which Lucy Gray’s character was portrayed was just…..weird. The southern accent really took me out of every song scene.

The transition of Snow going from good to bad was also handled in such an odd way. Theres little hints throughout the movie of his mindset changing, but it felt like out of nowhere his intentions drastically change in that forest scene.

For a film that is 2.5 hours, the ending was oddly rushed.

And im sorry, but killing off the down syndrome tribute by mowing her down with snakes out of nowhere was unfortunately….comedic. What was even the point of that character??? 

This was such a strange film, but i definitely won’t say I didnt enjoy parts of it. For the most part it is fine. Just kind of bewildered at some of the casting and writing choices.",2023-11-29

"I thought this movie was really good like solid 8/10 which I did not expect. I’d rate it right behind the first and second hunger games. I thought it was better than both part 1 and part 2 mockingjay movies. 

Snow had something wrong with him from the start likely triggered when he was a little kid watching people literally eat each other to survive. He’s just way too calculated and cold with how he goes about things. You can’t say for certain he’s always acting in his own self interest because you don’t hear his inner dialogue but I thought the scene when he tells his sister that killing the tribute made him feel powerful was telling. It’s likely all his “good” deeds were probably half about doing the right thing and half about this is what’s best for me.",2023-12-03
At least Tom Blyth was nice to look at for two and a half hours,2023-12-16
"I’m super late but just got out of my showing and wanted to write my thoughts somewhere **(minor book spoilers ahead)**:

- I disagree with the critiques that the ending was rushed. A lot of part 3 in the book was introspection from Snow which I think they did a good job of adapting. We’re not gonna sit for an hour while he thinks and washes dishes. 
- I do think Sejanus’s storyline was underdeveloped and it showed the most in part 3. We didn’t really spend enough time with Sejanus overall. We never met Ma or Strabo Plinth except for an approving nod from Strabo. We never really saw their fortune, it was only alluded to. That was a big plotline in the book, the contrast between sejanus’s wealth and his dissatisfaction with the capitol vs snows poverty and dedication to it. 
- Why did they cut the part about Strabo buying Sejanus’s way into the Peacekeaper corp as a way to avoid worse punishment? They already set him up as willing to pay for his way out of anything. They just dropped that plotline? Why? Why would Sejanus join the corp on his own if he hated the capitol? That was frustrating. 
- Why did they go with sej-ANUS (lol) for the pronunciation instead of SEJ-inus? Whatever, enough about Sejanus
- Rachel Zegler is a really good singer. She really breathed life into the lyrics from the book (which were mostly taken verbatim). 
- Dinklage is amazing as Dean Highbottom. 
- Lucky Flickerman was equally amazing. Better than book Lucky imo. His coin toss introduction was cold
- Definitely felt like they pulled some punches with the PG-13 lack of blood. Especially at Arachnes death. 
- I could have done with a training montage of Snow/Sej being indoctrinated, maybe Snow taking the officer test.
- I pictured Billy Taupe being much taller and foreboding. Spruce was a more interesting character to look at in the rebel scenes which should not have been the case imo. 
- District 12 looked AMAZING. Holy shit that was totally missing from the original trilogy films. The giant coal refineries. The open quarries. The Hob. It felt so expansive and lived in. 
- Capitol wide shots looks solid as well although again I wish we got to see Sejanus’s apartment compared to the Snow’s
- Wish there was a beat before the Epilogue sequence. We just suddenly cut to Snow with long hair again and need to assume time has passed. 
- The arena scenes were very well done IMO. Well paced and intense.

Overall I really enjoyed the adaptation and I think it has solid legs as a standalone film if you haven't read the book (though you'd be missing out on some good character development that is hurried through in the movie). Probably my favorite Hunger Games film now.",2023-12-18
64 years later...this chick named Swamp Potato shows up calling herself Mocking Jay and dismantles his entire world...while singing his ex girlfriend's (whom he 'killed') song.,2023-12-30
"One element left out that was a *major* freaky moment in the books was Clemensia transforming into a *literal snake human* after the bite. I remember feeling a chill run down my spine when she showed Corio her scaly skin and yellow lizard eyes. They must've left it out to dial back on the horror, lol.",2024-01-01
"I've gotta say, Schwartzman is absolutely killing it this year. He was easily my favorite part of this movie.

I know this is probably a hot take because it's exactly what killed the momentum for Mockingjay, but this probably should have been two movies. I had a solid time with this movie, but it is clearly too long and paced in a way that when the third act starts you're like, oh we're gonna keep going? Perhaps those that have read the book will feel differently, but the actual Hunger Games finishing with an hour left in the movie threw me for a huge loop. 

The hardest thing this movie has to do is get us from a sympathetic main character to a sociopathic dictator, and I salute the effort. But it definitely needed more time for the transition, and there's just so many characters in each act that it felt like the speedrun was losing us a lot of fleshing out for the side characters. There's classmates, other tributes, character actors, and a lot of table setting before we even switch settings entirely. The BIG performances like Schwartzman and Dinklage and Davis doing Frank-N-Furter with those gloves are given their time to shine, and everything else feels like the lite version of what's probably in the book. 

The Games aspect of this movie is also kind of insane. Just wrapping my head around the decision to still have the games in the same arena that's just been blown up is a lot. Obviously it's a foreshadow for the idea of the arena's being unique, having places to hide and camp out, etc. But for the actual story going on it didn't seem to be the best choice. And there's lots of that kind of hinting at what the games will one day be but the actual game in this movie is pretty simple, it just kind of took me by surprise that the Game itself wasn't really the focal part of the movie. 

I did enjoy the performances from Snow and Lucy. I don't know if I totally buy their relationship, and I know the ending is supposed to be a mystery that ends up driving Snow kind of insane, but they were great. Interesting choice to make this kind of a diegetic musical. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it was really awkward. For the first half of the movie none of the songs get any instrumentals which sometimes felt odd, but Zegler has such an incredible classic voice I wasn't complaining. 

I also thought this movie did a pretty good job of highlighting just how little you have to think of another person to put them in this situation. While I do think the violence was toned down even more than the predecessors and that was a bummer, the ideas about propaganda, celebrity, fascism, class, etc are all still more or less intact and that's what this series is all about. I'm not sure I ever really wondered why Snow liked being rich and in control, but the idea that he created the perfect celebrity and spent the next 60 years trying to do it again and when he does it causes his downfall is an interesting one. 

Anyways, it's solid and if you're a fan of the series there's lots of fun hints at what's to come, as well as maybe some groaner lines, but I'd imagine if you're getting dragged to this it might be a bit of a bore. Even for me, who saw the original movies when they came out and very much enjoyed revisiting them for this one, I found this to be too long and not all the time well utilized. Solid 6/10.

"The movie failed to show Snow as a sociopath. The book makes it very clear how little Snow cares about others. The movie makes it seem like Snow likes Sejanes or anyone.

Focusing on the games is also a mistake, part of the book that is interesting is Snow not knowing if Lucy grey is actually a nice girl or not. 

The pacing felt rushed through the movie, and things that I thought stood out in the books (Sejanus' death, the zoo death, the snake pit with clemie,etc.) could have been done better. 

Overall 6/10-6.5/10",2023-11-17
Rachel Zegler going in and out of her Sandra Bullock Blindside accent deserves an oscar nom,2023-11-17
"If Snow was a self serving sociopath all along, they did an incredibly poor job of showing that in the first two thirds of the movie. Him comitting all of his vile actions in the final third to ""land on top"", comes off as out of character and unmotivated. Very poorly written. Which is a shame, because the world building, costuming, cinematography, and acting all deserved much better",2023-11-19

Pleasantly surprised to see this isn't awful,2023-11-17
"I didn't read the book, and disappointed that HOW exactly Hunger Games came to be, and WHO was the people behind the first hunger games, and WHAT did it took for so many Capitol people to actually accept children killing other children?... not explored and also disappointed that there are no better hints on exact relationship of Lucy Gray and Katniss, LOL still a mystery there.

BUT that said, this is JUST like The Hunger Games in everyway in tone, in directing, in music (same ones of course) and ALL the new actors gave their BEST! 


Loved the movie, It's not bad for sure!",2023-11-18
"Listen, I didn’t hate this movie. But once they went to Part 3 and I realized I still had 30+ minutes to go, I was ready for it to be over.",2023-11-28
"I didn't like it. It didn't have the same vibe as the other movies. The tributes were too keen and confident, especially Lucy Gray, and not the picture of an oppressed people 10 years in to a brutal occupation. Lucy was a little to perfect right out the gate, compared to, say, Katniss who started very green and had to build her confidence over time by surviving the games. The singing at the reaping was a bit much. Also, the production quality (especially the lighting) screamed Harry Potter.

The ending was also incredibly anticlimactic. You could feel the tension building with Snow and Lucy especially in the woods, but then it just went poof. 

IMO this film was a parody of the Hunger Games trilogy. It lacked all of the key elements that made it compelling.

NOTE: Hilarious that I'm being downvoted just for having an opinion on a movie. This site is pathetic.",2023-12-13
"I haven’t read the book… but did anyone interpret a connection between Lucy singing the song under the tree, the mockingbirds,  the Katniss roots and the first movies about Katniss Everdeen",2023-11-18
"I saw it tonight and (no surprise) I loved it! Tom and Rachel were amazing in their roles. I was a bit put off by her accent, but then I got used to it. Plus her singing is beautiful! Tom, wow, along with rocking a buzz cut he's a great actor. He translated Snow's thoughts beautifully. The rest of the cast was perfection, particularly Octavia and the one that played Flickerman. I chuckled at him doing the weather. 
 
Sejanus's hanging was brutal, to say the least. It was quite fast paced compared to the book. However, the actor screaming ""Ma!"" and it being echoed by the birds was hard to hear. Snow shooting at the mockingjays manically was...chills. To see him go from grief to pure anger left me in shock. It's great the movie made it clear he loved Lucy. It turned sour at the end, but he did. Unfortunately, there's no exception for someone who is as apathetic as him. 

Music was great, sometimes I didn't even realize it was there. Cinematography wasn't as iconic as the other movies. Still, it was cool toned and polished. My one gripe is not hearing more of Snow and Lucy's conversation about humanity. It would have been cool, but I don't think not having it affected the quality of the film. I also sort of missed Clem? Yet, that last image of her being dragged off could sear itself in your mind.",2023-11-19
"It was very good, I liked it even more than the original movies, the pace was slower for the third act but okay. 

I think I liked it more than the originals because the problems that the tributes were facing were more touching and also the aspect of Snow having his own interests for helping Lucy",2023-11-19
I saw it today and I was not disappointed actually. I thought it stuck very close to the books but some comments here are reminding me of some things they left out that would give much better context so yeah that's a disappointment but a very minor one. The music was really awesome too.,2023-11-19

"Just read the Book and then went to the Movie after that and my guess is that he never meant Sejanus as his third kill but Lucy and all their interaction after that is just in his head, giving more sense to the three kills and why he is hounted by the hanging tree song, because he killed her there as his third kill to wipe out the last evidence ( she seemed like she knew that the weapons are there so she maybe told him before )",2023-12-13

"I’m honestly surprised it’s so well liked, I could barely sit through it without cringing so hard. Lucy’s accent, the overdramatic singing/performing (I know it says ballad, I was expecting singing, but it was a lot), and how slow moving the first hour and a half were made the movie hard to watch. The dialogue didn’t feel as deep as the older movies and everything seemed surface level to me. IMO it was absolutely my least favorite out of all of the movies, which is super disappointing",2024-02-23

"Book reader here, and I've got to say I really would've enjoyed this movie a lot more had I not read the book, but there's no world in which I wouldn't have read it, so here's some opinions. 

What I liked:
- Tom Blyth was phenomenal in this. Even without the illumination of an internal monologue that we get in the books, he managed to portray as well as he could Snow's inner emotions onto his expressions and pauses and minute mannerisms. 

- The music and singing was well done and brought Lucy Gray's upbringing and lyrics to life. I thought Rachel Zegler was well casted even if I didn't like her/whoever's decision it was to make Lucy seem more aggressive/rebellious than she was in the book.

- LOVED Viola Davis as Dr. Gaul, her performance was chilling, brutal, and gave me the same vibe as the character in the book. I originally had imagined her as a wiry professor-looking doctor, but loved the adaptation here.   

- Hunter was everything as Tigris, portrayed the loving and hard-working cousin very well and had the perfect amount of screen time to reflect her relationship with Snow.

What I disliked:
- What I originally loved so much about the book is that yes, this is a villain origin story, but throughout so much of the book, I was still rooting for Coryo, deeply understood his internal conflicts, and the tension was high throughout the entire book because he was SO conflicted with so many decisions. We didn't get to see that at all in the movie, particularly regarding Sejanus. In the book, Coryo vacillates between disgust with Sejanus' pitiful and naive outlook of the state of Panem and what he could do to possibly change the order of things, jealousy of his rise in power and status due to the influence of his father and the money they gained through the previous war, and intense relief of companionship in his most difficult personal times. In the book, Coryo truly cared for Sejanus when they were Peacekeepers and tried his very best to dissuade him from rebellious acts, and EVEN THEN after Sejanus was actively and openly acting with treason Coryo STILL hesitates and is extremely conflicted about sending the recording to Dr. Gaul, and even after he sends it, hopes that it is just waylaid or that Dr. Gaul wouldn't understand to play the recording. I think the movie absolutely butchered their dynamic as well as Sejanus' portrayal in the movie. Many people are calling him a ""fake activist"" when actually in the books, he is the only one openly defying the Capitol during the games, trying to help the best way he can with his position as a Peacekeeper, and genuinely not caring if he lives or dies, in fact, he HATES that his father can get him out of situations unscathed in the book and iirc tried to kill himself at least once. 

- The whole point of the prequel is supposed to be illuminating HOW Coryo's perception of humanity and society and it's interplay changes throughout his experiences. I thought they should've emphasized way more the lessons/assignments he received from Dr. Gaul, particularly the 3 C's (chaos, control, and contract) and how in the end, his love and need for control rises above all else and is the defining motive in which he acts throughout ALL of the rest of hunger games series. I know they touched on it with the whole shoulder bandaging scene, but it wasn't enough considering the huge conclusions that Coryo made regarding society and how it shaped the future Hunger Games. 

- WHY did they just kill all the tension with the snake scene by revealing what would happen to the Asian girl if she did not have any part in writing the assignment? It just made her seem like a stupid teacher's pet who willingly stuck her hand in a pit of snakes despite knowing the horrible consequences (it kinda played into this Asian stereotype which I hate lmao). They could've easily just explained it after she did it. 

- I think they really dropped the ball in portraying how actually WELL-LIKED Coryo was amongst his peers and how calculated it could be AND how genuine it could be too. In the book, Coryo actually presents their partner assignment to Dr. Gaul as having been a group effort, trying to cover Asian girl's ass because he knows and understands so deeply social cues and how to present himself as a humble star student despite being very calculated at times. But they also missed how he genuinely DID like his classmates and get along with them simply because he grew up with them in the Capitol. He visited Asian girl in the hospital, he was truly shaken by their deaths, and he struck up a genuine camaraderie with Lysistrata (Jessup's mentor) which is why SHE was the one who suggested and ended up spending all her money to send Jessup water and thwart him from killing Lucy in the arena. Idk what the point was of making it seem like Coryo aggressively demanded her to send water and made her look mad at him when she was out of the games, when in the book, she did it herself to help him because he was generally well-liked by his peers. 

- Overall, the movie was good, I think I just really loved the book's many nuances and the constant warring internal conflict that made me really understand Coryo as a person and future villain. The main difference is that the movie made it very clear that Coryo actively made decisions that propelled him into his villain future. Whereas, in the book, it was a combination of upbringing, loss of status, decisions that were constantly made either tentatively or in a moment of high pressure that led to unavoidable consequences and then internal justifying of said actions because of these unavoidable consequences, and then finally the conscious conclusion of a need for control. Suzanne Collins is superb at making me feel like, wow, if I were in this character' shoes, I might have acted the same even if I don't agree with what they're doing, in both Coryo AND Katniss, two completely opposite characters. But in the movie, I felt like I definitely would never have acted like Coryo, and that's my long-winded gripe about the movie. 

If you made it all the way here, thank you for coming to my TED talk!!",2023-12-03
"Just found this discussion so I’m posting this pretty late. It’s my favorite adaptation of the books! The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is my favorite book and this kept all of the major plot points while keeping the same theme pretty well. I loved the pacing actually and the shots were amazing! 

Excellent and I mean excellent use of scores, I think it was an incredible decision to use the same ending score from Mockingjay Pt 1 for the ending of the movie when Snow looks at the statue to inspire that same feeling of dread in the audience. Also having a rainbow over a gray statue of woman after Flickerman said that all rainbows/colors lead to gray was a wonderful decision.

Although I do definitely wish they kept some smaller things, add in Sejanus’s mother more because she had a decent part in the book. She begs Snow to save Sejanus in the arena, she sends him food and letters in District 12, calls him a second son and even funds his education at the end. And yet Snow thinks she’s uneducated, lesser than the Capitol’s citizens but lies to her face about being Sejanus’s best friend. 

Tigris in a more heartbreaking aspect is implied in the books to have resorted to prostitution as a child to get food and money on the table for her family. There’s this incredible line in the book that has always stuck with me and it was, “because if she had done it, she had done it for me”

And when you put that into context for the trilogy and what Snow forced the victors to do, it’s just heartbreaking. 

I do think one of the worst decisions was to get rid of the Capitol’s humanity. The movie made the decision to act like Sejanus was the only dissenter but Snow’s generation was just as vital to the games as Katniss’s generation was. Multiple people within the Capitol besides Tigris thought the games were vile, people like Lysistrata, Clemensia, and the guy(sorry forgot his name) who gave Lucy Gray the guitar from his club. All of who were cut majorly from the movie.",2023-12-04

"So Snow says he killed three people, but Lucy only knows about two and gets mad. At that point he’s killed:
- the boy in the arena which I’m pretty sure she knows about.
- the mayors daughter and her boyfriend which she knows about and is there for
- Sejamus which she doesn’t know was directly him and then puts two and two together and gets mad

All up that’s four though - why didn’t they up the number to four instead of three in this conversation? I just kept being like “hasn’t he killed more people?”

What am I missing?

Overall I liked the first two parts, but thought the third dragged a little. 6/10, there’s definitely life breathed back into the franchise after what I felt were terrible movies in Mockingjay Part 1 and 2.",2023-12-09

"I actually liked the movie more than I thought I would. I had heard in general that the ending was hit or miss and that there was a lot of singing in the movie, so I wasn't sure how I was going to like it.

Neither of those things in the end really bothered me. The singing I thought was fine and I didn't think it was over done or annoying. I thought the initial singing at the reaping was a little cringey but other than that I was fine with it.


Overall what I really liked was the history we get behind the games, and I loved seeing an old school game play out. Lucy Gray was such an interesting character and I really liked that we saw someone who wasn't so physically strong like Katniss.

Viola Davis was great in her role and so was Peter Dinklage, all the acting was really top notch. Rachel Zeglar did a great job, except I did find her southern accent strange. 

I also see a lot of people complaining about Snow's 180 at the end, but I don't really think that's the case, plus I was prepared as we know what he becomes so it didn't surprise me in the end what he did. I wish we had more clarity on what happened to Lucy Gray but I think it's fine also leaving it open ended.",2023-12-26

Just saw it and it was very good.  Almost as good as the original IMO.,2024-01-05
"Very random though- I liked how you could tell the difference between Katniss getting dolled up vs coming straight out the district. 
They kept homegirls make up infuckingtact 24/7 despite every bit of wild shit that was happening in this movie that immediately makes my brow sweat, make up gone.",2024-01-19
Was Zegler extremely bad? Most of her acting and accent shifting felt so unnatural it took me out of the movie.,2024-02-19
"As a fan of this franchise, I was very disappointed by the acting and missing storyline. Seemed super corny and rushed.",2024-02-24
"the first 20 minutes almost lost me because I felt they were playing it too seriously and melodramatically...like calm down this is a franchise from a decade ago that isn't SOO held in high esteem that we have to treat it like this. afterwards the tones of the dialogue and whatnot evened out and it became engaging. 

the names are still too much; whenever a character was mentioned offscreen i had trouble who the hell they were talking about until they came back, especially with Snow's fellow students. Like who the hell was the kid that died in the bombing? I thought the president's kid but that was Snow's friend so who was he? idk. 

Zegler's character seemed silly and caricature-like until eventually they had to make harder choices and also there's the idea that she is using Snow. The whole Hunger Game arc seemd so underdeveloped considering the other movies were all about the games.

Viola Davis killed it. the main guy was pretty good too. Not sure why the rebel in 12 didn't turn Snow in but it's fine. Overall I think I actually liked it more than some of the original 4, but I like villain origin stories especially when they are more complex than ""we want you to empathize with the villain""",2023-11-19
"Really shocked to see so many positive reactions. Was literally probably the worst movie I’ve ever seen in theaters. Walked out with 30 minutes left and was probably the 4th or 5th person to leave by that time. 

Just every aspect of the plot was insanely stupid. Absolutely ridiculous movie.",2023-11-20
"Disappointing movie. First two acts are watchable  but I wasn't really invested in the outcome of the games like I was in the original. The characters just aren't good enough. The main girl did not seem like a real person at all. 

Third act is a chore. Really quite boring with rushed and unsatisfying character development. Poor use of runtime with too many scenes of the girl singing and not enough story progression. Visually it wasn't much of a spectacle either. 5/10.",2023-11-19
Rachel Zegler was by far the worst part of the movie. Just unbearable and terrible acting. People saying this is the best movie in the franchise are probably just book stans. Cuz this shit was mid at best. The last third of the movie was the best part and could've used more fleshing out. The games themselves were boring and the acting of all the tributes was  cringe terrible,2023-11-26
"Shocked at some of the comments, this was the corniest movie I’ve seen in a minute. The writing is bad bad",2023-12-09
"I realize that this movie is by no means getting rave reviews, but that was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The second movie I've considered walking out of (the first being Tenet when I couldn't hear a word). Biggest waste of two and a half hours ever",2023-11-18
"Just a casual THG fan and I didn’t read the books, but I have mixed feelings. The performances from Davis, Dinklage, Schwartzman (he got a few chuckles out of me, ngl) were great. Is it just me or did Zegler overact a bit at some parts? I was afraid the song usage would be annoying (not big on musicals), but it was fine, not that jarring. The Hanging Tree was overused, but it fit the theme so there’s that. The score by Newton Howard was uninteresting otherwise. Sadly, a big chunk of the movie actually bored me. It felt like there was nothing at stake during the hunger games. We knew Lucy Gray was going to win. I think I liked the third act the most. Something was actually starting to happen and it felt like Snow finally had some agency. I also liked that Lucy Gray vanished and kind of became the myth she was telling Snow about. 

But I just…couldn’t get invested in Snow’s character in the first place? I usually eat up villain origin stories, but he was so all over the place. He was kind of bland and too sympathetic at the beginning (if he was supposed to be arrogant and Machiavellian, they didn’t manage to capture that) and it was pretty out of character for him to suddenly switch to talking about how he felt powerful while murdering someone, and dressing like Draco Malfoy’s cousin. I don’t know, his whole descent into evil felt half-baked, I couldn’t buy it. I’m sure it was executed better in the book (I’m hearing he was quite a sociopath in it) because you actually get to hear the character’s inner thoughts.",2023-11-17
Ok maybe this was better explained in the book but I cannot for the life of me understand the motivation behind Snow selling out Sejanus!! Like whyyyyyy record that conversation with the jabberjays and send to Dr. Gaul knowing there’s no way this man would survive that?? I know he wanted him to stop working with the rebels but it still seemed so random for him to just decide to turn his friend in and then to cry about it when it hit his friend hung for it later lol. I know they’ve been hinting Snow having a dark side despite the foreground hero/love story of him and Lucy Gray but am I supposed to just accept that his dark side just came out in that moment causing him to sell out his friend without any real provocation?,2023-11-18
"I do love post apocalyptical movies and well the original hunger games film. Went to this one, sure it was darker, some of i, but also Disney movie like with the singing, yeah I like musicals so the songs weren’t bad, she’s a gifted singer.

The pacing though, wow I got bored in this movie, just long parts of it that was plain uninteresting, and 2hrs 40m is way too long imo.

To be honest, district 12 is supposed to be horrible right? Little food and such, but then they just stroll off to a beautiful lake house with plentiful of fish, quite a paradise, I don’t know, why would anyone ever go back. 

Happy if people enjoyed it but I surely wasn’t able to.


Oh did he really say that he killed 3 in the movie? I didn’t hear that, I thought he just said killed. He could’ve said he killed his friend as well right since his voice was on the recorder that would make it 3, but people make mistakes when stressed.

Anyhow, no offense, just my personal opinion.",2023-11-19
"I’ve only ever seen the first movie, and read none of the books. I found this to be surprisingly compelling. I give it one thumbs up.

I appreciate how it truly does not shy away from the brutality of its world building and premise. The Hunger Games seems to be about surviving in a totalitarian world; if that’s what your movie is about, make it what it is about, and the hunger games certainly does. The regime feels real in its violence and oppression, which I think is important for its main themes. 

I found Snow to be super compelling throughout, until the last 30ish minutes. I thought the story did a great job constantly putting him in morally grey scenarios, where his only options to survive or get ahead are the worst ones. I loved the way they used his best friend to show how the naïveté of idealism clashes with the pragmatic reality of living in such a world. The friend is only allowed to be idealistic because he has the privilege and protection of extraordinary wealth.

The filmmaking overall was mediocre. It was an odd mix of having a consistent baseline of “passable”, rising to the occasion in the most important moments (the arena, the execution), and hitting wild cornball low points at generally inconsequential times. 

Weirdest fuckin musical I have ever seen",2023-11-22
It's too much book for one movie but not enough book for two movies 😅,2023-11-26
"I mostly enjoyed the movie, except for a few things. Sejanus was poorly cast. His acting felt so flat compared to the character in the book. Rachel’s fake accent was bad and distracting - they should have either dropped it or cast an actress with a legitimate southern accent. And the lack of internal monologue from the book made it seem like Snow was mostly a decent person all along who randomly snapped in the forest, when the book makes it clear that he was always a bit of a sociopath. 

I went back and rewatched the original trilogy this week and those films were so much BETTER, in large part due to the acting, I think. You can’t beat Jennifer Lawrence.",2023-11-30
Probably the worst movie out of the Series 🚮,2023-12-13
It is faithful to the book.,2023-11-17
"Just finished the movie less than an hour ago. I laughed at this movie a lot. It was practically a musical. I would have preferred if the movie ended after part 2. The third act made the hunger games completely inconsequential to the Lucy Grey character. Every redeemable character was incredibly stupid. 

As attempted critique of class tendencies, a lot about the characters could have been way sharper. All the pre-games deaths were absolutely excellent. What a movie to come out during these times. The best part of the movie was that Reaper dude covering the bodies with the flags. I really thought he was gonna hold up the three fingers after that. I would have loved if the rebel crew at the end was planning to do something more than just leave.

Solid 2/10 tbh. My theater was full. One person tried to clap at the end. No one joined her lol. I’m sure the book is better. I would so rather watch or read something about resistance in the districts though.",2023-11-18
"Don't make me say it, *please* don't make me say it...

Alright, fine. I'll say it. But I'm spoiler-tagging it.

>!I didn't like Rachel Zegler in this. Especially her singing.!<",2023-11-29
Really really poor filmmaking all around just a disappointment in almost every way,2023-11-20
"i watched it with people who didn’t read the book and although we all enjoyed it, there were soooo many gaps i had to to fill in for them after the movie. its a difficult book to transfer to film so i think they did the best they could but it was unfortunate to have so many crucial things missing (his deep hate for the jabberjays, ma and her cooking, the first kiss from the zoo)

the lead actors were amazing and the sets were really well done. i really want to give huge praise to the explosion scene. it was a jump scare and just as intense as i pictured it in my head. bravo for that!

overall it was a great experience and had me entertained from start to finish and i will be watching again.",2023-11-17
"So I really like the book series, and I like the movie, but I want to complain about Part 2.

I did not like the changes they made from the book, having less of the tributes dead before the games start. In the book 9 of them die before the Games begin (not including Marcus). I think in the movie they mention 4 of them die in the bombing plus Brandy in the zoo. The problem is ""solved"" by having a bloodbath, where the number is whittle down to the original number. Circ and Teslee, both who survive to the snakes in the book, are killed in this point.

There is no need for this aside from having an action sequence in the movie. In contrast to the worldview Gaul is pushing, where humanity is inherently evil, in the book only a couple of tributes are actually killed by each other. They mostly die of natural causes from neglect or interference from the Capitol. The snakes as well being the end of the Games, whereas in the book there is a whole different section where the final 5 duke it out.

Making Coral the antagonist of the Arena section is also a curious change, when in the book I would say Reaper fills that role. While, yes, Coral is responsible for the most kills in the book, Reaper is the final survivor, he's the one who is the present threat in the main part of the arena, he's the one whose mentor has a relationship with Snow. Like, Clemensia is not in the movie once she is bitten, while in the book there is a whole storyline with her recovery, conflict and reconciliation with Snow, etc. I get they had to cut things, but the combination of cuts and changes they made specifically with the games part left me disappointed.",2023-11-18
"I’m an avid book reader and the original 4 movies are in my DNA. I really enjoyed this one! I keep thinking about it. I just adore all the little connections to THG. 

I would love a young Haymitch movie!",2023-11-18
"They use birds for voice recording but they also have DNA testing technology?

I thought the movie was fun, but after the hunger games ended, there was still another hour left of the movie. I thought we'd get to see more from Reaper during the hunger games.",2023-11-22
"Can someone explain, why did the professor kill himself at the end of the film? Or was he just foolish enough to drink a substance that was clearly gonna be tampered by Snow?

Is it up to interpretation or did he actually kill himself?",2023-11-27
"the whole movie felt like it was produced by disney. it felt cheap and rushed. it’s so flat and kinda boring. lucy gray is also kind of not so relatable, she seemed out of herself? like the feeling when you’re dissociating.",2023-12-16
"I enjoyed it. Agree with pretty much everything here. 

The movie could have used more tell than show because not everyone will notice the gears turning in Snow’s head as he watches Lucy Gray’s reaping and so on. The movie tried making it obvious Snow is thinking, but it will be missed *what* he was thinking and why he did anything he did.

It’s not a comedy, but I found myself laughing too many times. For example, I couldn’t stop laughing at Zegler’s attempt at an accent. Sometimes, just let a Jersey girl be a Jersey girl. Lucy Gray not being from District 12 would have allowed it.

I love Zegler’s singing. Didn’t necessarily like some of the choices made for the songs in this movie, but they work.

The movie definitely got me wanting more stories from this universe (again). And they don’t necessarily *need* characters we already know.",2023-11-17
lucy gray baird more like lucy slay baird because she was so good in this movie i think this is my favorite hunger games movie but i also view it as the most well written & nuanced emotionally,2023-11-19
"Thought this movie was a fine, like a solid 6/10.

The acting is phenomenal allround, and the world built for this movie was so interesting. The post-industrial setting with the hacked together technology is spot on. The Capitol is also by far and away the most captivating place in the Hunger Games series and this movie just reinforces that. 

The problems I have with this movie are unfortunately the same problems I have with the book: the last third just kinda sucks. The emergency brakes on the pacing right after the games just kills any momentum the movie had. The story also just makes no sense at all, and District 12 is not interesting enough to make up for it.

It seems to be a common criticism that this movie should have been 2, and while I see why people say that, the issue is that the second movie would be so boring. There'd have to be a ton of creative liberty taken there to have that movie be good at all.",2023-11-21
"As a huge ass hunger games fan: this Movie was garbage tbh. 

They way overdid it with the singing from the protagonist (kinda cringed at one point at all the singing) and the third act was boring, terribly paced and just totally out of place.",2023-12-29
"Honestly felt entirely overacted from Zegler, almost like she was performing on stage and she was auditioning for Eponine in Les Mis.

That's not even mentioning the incredibly inconsistent accent.",2023-12-29
Lucy Grey character was pretty bad in this movie,2023-11-20
"I really enjoyed the movie. I haven’t read the book (I did read the trilogy though and saw their movies). But I love how different the Hunger Games are in this one compared to trilogy. They didn’t care about their Tributes but when Snow is running the games, there’s training, food, better transportation, stylists, it’s a whole event.",2023-11-19
"We liked it but, as with the whole franchise, it could get a bit *too* languid and ‘thoughtful’ in places.

I liked the ‘ancestors’ aspects, Caesar Flickerman’s father (possibly) and Catniss’ forebear character too.

The technically basic Hunger Game itself, set in the one location, Capital City still being reconstructed, years after the uprising, and the grinding poverty experienced by the District 12-ers were nice touches.",2023-11-20
"I enjoyed it as I honestly enjoy most movies… but in the car ride home from the theater, I couldn’t stop finding criticisms! I thought Snows transformation in the last 10 minutes of the film into the villain we all know in love from the trilogy was cheesy? I didn’t know if it was the script or the actors performance but it read sooo corny to me. Although I loved his performance in the rest of the movie, the ending left a sour taste in my mouth. I also didn’t understand if Lucy Gray running away was premeditated or spontaneous? It read spontaneous to me when she was in the forest, but then the birds singing and the snake trap mads it seem like she planned this all along. Idk, it didn’t capture the magic of the trilogy which to me are masterpieces in the YA dystopian genre. Although I was happy to just have more hunger games in my life.",2023-11-25
"Can I watch the new hunger games if I have snake phobia?

So I really want to go watch the new movie and I was wondering if anyone who has seen it already can tell me how many snakes scenes there are. I am really afraid of snakes but I can manage to watch them a little on the screen, or at least I can try to. I don t want to go and be be unable to watch half of the movie. Thanks!",2023-11-25
"The devolving relationship between Snow and Gray in chapter 3 was such a 180 for me. How did it get from Im willing to risk everything for your survival in chapter 2, and gonna runaway with you to I’m gonna kill you because you might turn me in? How did the tension in the cabin get that bad? And what if he did unintentionally betray Sejanus?",2023-11-26
"I didn't read the book so I can't compare the movie to the book...but I actually liked the movie! 

It seems to have less focus on the ""Hunger Games"" and more focus on the relationship between Lucy Gray and Snow.

I know it's a movie so the POV is neutral, but I know the book has Snow's POV in it...which includes his internal monologues. So the movie kind of shows us his expressions, but it's hard to know what he is thinking because *supposedly* the way he presents himself and the internal monologues he has are contradictory...",2023-11-26
"My brother’s only prior experience with the franchise is the original novel, which he didn’t like. He said he wished there had been more stuff about the politics of Panem and how the games were set up. He’s wondering if this one will give him what he wants and if he’ll have to see any of the films to catch up?",2023-11-26
"I really enjoyed the movie, but they did Clemensia so dirty with her character changes and the scenes they cut. :(",2023-12-01
"Good film I thought however I would of liked it if snow got a bit more harmed/betrayed at the end by Lucy 

I don’t know if getting bit by a snake and not seeing her again can justify becoming the evil president of the capital 

Thought she was going to stab him in the back and leave him for dead or something 🤷🏻‍♂️🤣",2023-12-01
The actor playing Snow looks like a young Ryan Gosling,2023-12-08
"I didn't necessarily love the book but the movie adapted the story fairly well. In some ways, it was better and in others, it was worse (as is the case with even the best adaptations). I feel like reading the book helped me a lot because it kind of felt very fast paced and I don't think certain scenes would've landed the same way with me if I hadn't associated it with my initial feelings from the book. That and I knew what to expect from Part 3 whereas I can totally understand how some people felt it dragged on after the end of the Games.

While it improved the pacing and the bloat, it got rid of a lot of elements I liked and carried over some of the narrative issues I didn't like from the book. They kept the story beats but had to sacrifice so much character development with the side characters that they were barely featured in a relevant way. It made me appreciate how dark the book got at times too because a lot of those parts were left out, which I do feel was because of time constraints and not solely because it was PG-13, since the runtime was already so long without them. 


Between Arachne's death, the arena bombing, and Clemensia being bitten, these scenes felt a lot more pivotal in the book but in the movie, they were reduced to its bare bones so I hope it still had impact for first time watchers.",2023-12-09
"I have never really watched the Hunger Games before. I knew just a little of the original about Katniss and the other guy and somewhat remember Snow (i just remember an old white haired dude). I also remember the stuff with the mockingjays. Overall I knew a bit about there being districts which were oppressed by the wealthy and the games were a show for the wealthy.

So overall I had very limited knowledge of the series and characters in it going into this movie. I think the movie did a great job explaining things. I was able to understand why everything was going on just from the background details throughout.

The movie was really good at conveying emotions. You can really put yourself in the characters shoes and imagine having to make the choices they had to.",2023-12-10
"What was that small bottle that Highbottom was drinking throughout the movie? I’m abit confuse. The third part was okay but other than that, it was very good. Solid 8/10",2023-12-11
"I liked that the Games arena was so rudimentary compared to what we see in the original films/books, but… it was so small. Wouldn’t it be over in like 10 minutes under normal circumstances, without debris in the middle and tunnels to escape through? There were no places to hide. It was just a flat, open area. How would sponsors be able to do anything? Why would any supplies even matter besides weapons? It would just be a straight brawl until someone came out on top.

Edit: Maybe there weren’t sponsors in the previous Games. I might have misremembered there. I thought there was a line of dialogue that implied there were. If so, it makes sense.",2023-12-15

“*I couldn’t possibly pick just* one *part that was awesome…*”

Not **one** mention of “*The Disney song routines were G and R*.”

Yeah. Right.",2023-12-20
"I liked that Snow falling in love with Lucy is what drove him mad in the end and the true meaning of the Games, that the world (or life) is “an arena” and from Snow, love can turn us insane. Since the moment he met Lucy Grey, he began changing. He becomes selfish and cheats the Games not for who he fell in love with but ultimately himself. Then, in an attempt to get his life back, he kills his friend, and Lucy abandons him, driving Snow insane, essentially killing their relationship. Then, after, Snow is entirely different compared to the beginning. In The Hunger Games with Katniss, he is alone, cold, and manipulative. He fears love and how it drove him mad. That's why he became obsessive in destroying Katniss by using love against her. 

What I wonder is, did Lucy ever love him? Or did she genuinely use him to gain her freedom? This is what I think haunted him even when he was old.",2023-12-21
"I’m not a book-reader but enjoyed the movies back when I was in high school. I’m sorry, but this movie did not hit for me. Relationships between characters didn’t feel earned enough by the time the plot really started kicking in.

I wish we had gotten more world building and the establishment of the hunger games, like rules, changes etc that would shape the future. Didn't care for the third act, most questions are unanswered that mattered like why Lucy left, where she went, what's her fate, does she have any connection to the future books.

"Pretty good cinematography and high production values throughout. The acting was mostly decent except for rachel zegler who tried too hard to get the audience to like her but instead came across as overly desperate and rather annoying. Her singing was certainly nothing special...

On that note there were also a surprising amount of songs and singing to the point where the film felt like a musical?! The trailers advertised the draw of the hunger games but that was actually only a third of the entire film. Also, the film dragged on wayyyyy too long especially in the first third act...for casual fans such as myself all of the exposition and romantic set-up at the expense of action scenes and the actual hunger games made the 2 hours and 40 minutes admittedly difficult to sit through.

**Overall** ***The*** ***Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes*** **(2023) rating: 4/10, good cinematography and high production values but the film dragged far too much - cutting out 30-45 minutes in the first and final third acts would have made this a much easier watch. Way too much singing for a non-musical.**",2023-11-26
"Fantastic movie : the story, tone and production were great. My only disappointment is the choice of the actors. Zegler performance was just bad. Her acting is Too theatrical and lacks lots of technique. Also Snow performance was very mediocre, but not really his fault because the directors dis not know how to translate his dark side.  A part from few false notes, the rest was very well done!",2023-11-20
"I read the book and saw the movie and loved both. I see so much hate for Snow, but honestly I feel bad for him. I really feel that, at so many points, he has no good options. And him betraying Sejanus was awful, but Sejanus put him in a really compromising situation. Snow wanted to get back to take care of his family in the Capitol so he needed to keep his nose clean as a peacekeeper and stay out of trouble. Obviously he becomes a terrible person by the end, but I feel he was a villain that was made and not born. And in the book, he has no plan of killing Lucy. He does want to return to 12 and go on to his training once he learns he can get rid of the guns, but I really didn’t think he was going to kill her. When she runs away from him that was his last straw imo. He was already breaking down mentally from everything. I think he could have turned out entirely different had his world not been so dark and survival-based. I really do feel bad for him and want to know if anyone else feels the same?",2023-11-27

I kinda wish this was a two-parter now that I’m reflecting on it. I wish I had more time learning about Snow’s growing up and also Lucy Gray’s story before jumping into the reaping. I think ending on her winning but Snow being told he’s in trouble and us not knowing if Lucy is alive would have been a killer end for Part 1. Then Part 2 could have spent all the time in 12 about the falling apart,2023-11-18

I think one of my favourite things about the movie is seeing how the Hunger Games and Panem as a whole have changed. How the tributes used to be treated like actual animals v the royal treatment they got in the recent Hunger Games was crazy to me. Also finding out how Snow shifted and influenced the game in certain ways was insane. Right?!?!,2024-03-15
I think the ending with snow and Lucy both trapped in there thoughts and both decided to kill one another was rushed the entire book there is no reason she would think he was going to kill her snow is a psychopath that part makes sense it just felt nonsensical why would she think that yes she is smart but there is nothing but snow helping her the entire time great book but I wish she would have altered the ending a bit,2024-03-23
"had hopes for the movie, i love the hunger games, but overall it was meh. the first two acts were… not good. 



 lucy gray’s introduction was so cringe it was hard to take the movie seriously after. the bright ass dress she never changed out of almost the whole movie… throwing a snake at a girl and then getting up on stage and singing (no peacekeeper stopping her?) and bowing (exactly like katniss did in hG2 … sigh. so heavy handed from the director to add that move) and for some reason wearing an obscene amount of makeup in the intro? idk if it was the actresses’ acting or what but everything she did felt very overacted and ‘disney’ if that makes sense. every facial expression, to the way she walked and talked was just awful.  



 viola davis was fun as the villain but so heavy handed! standing in her evil secret lab (no one else works there?) plotting their deaths... all she needed was a claw/hook for a hand or an evil pet cat or something lol. again, just very cartoonish/disney, like THIS IS THE VILLIAN, zero subtlety. (listen i love disney but they have a certain formula they abide by and i thought this movie was going to be a little more adult..)  old man snow in the hunger games movies was the obvious villain but he had nuance to him. he was so much scarier in his performance because it seemed real and again, less overacted.



  couldn’t tell you a thing about the other contenders. would have been nice if there was a little more focus on them and the other mentors. the other movies you knew who people were and therefore cared if they lived or died (they literally SAY THIS in this movie lmao like corno/cornholio/whatverthefuckhisnameis actually states that they need the audience to care about the kids to want to watch the games and then the movie proceeds to rush everything to do with them and therefore we don’t give af about them. the irony!!)



 the first half of the movie the lighting was far too dark. couldn’t see a damn thing half the time. worse than that episode of game of thrones (iykyk) i get the games itself was only supposed to be one part of the movie but they were boring. she hid in a hole the whole time. 50+ shots of young snow looking ‘horrified’/pouting to the camera.



  third act was far better than the previous two in my eyes. maybe it was just the beautiful countryside and so i could finally see what the hell was going on.  the pacing was rushed again tho and i could honestly not even tell you what was going on with snows friend and lucy’s ex and their rebel plans and what not it was so boring.



 lucy and young snow did not have great chemistry. idk if it’s just her acting or his too but… no.  
‘i value trust over everything, even love’… sigh. i know there are a lot of positive comments in here about this movie (im genuinely not trying to by cynical just callin it as i see it) and people were hailing this comment as great ‘subtle foreshadowing’… there’s ZERO subtle about it! she’s legit spelling out exactly what happens, just hamfisting it down the audiences throat! the second she said it i groaned. 
maybe im not the target audience for this because every single thing was has happened in this movie feels like it’s for 13 year olds??


 hiding a snake under his moms scarf or whatever to bite him…. sigh. like a snake it going to just stay hidden under there? idk just goofy honestly.  
and there was not really enough built up in their relationship for this demise.  i see snippets of sociopathic snow here and there but i wish they drove it home more. how selfish he really is. the one time they really needed to go for it in the movie and they didn’t. but they over acted everything else lol 




 then he’s just pardoned and working in the lab with superVILLIAN? ok…? just so rushed, what was the point of him going out there for like a summer vacation then immediatly coming back lol. ‘ you are a supervillian like me and let’s work together!! muahaha! ‘ christ.  



 ok positives because i’ve totally dumped on this movie lol, i liked the twist with peter dinklage’s character. i liked jason shwartzman as a flickerman relative, that was great casting, they actually look quite alike.  i liked the time period and how the games were still new, the contenders in a zoo like cage for people to gawk at. technology like out of the 50s but also some high tech, that vibe was solid.   hunter schafer was fine, wish she had more to do but she was a good choice.



 overall 5/10 movie. the pacing was not good, the lightning was poor half the movie, majority of the acting was not great and far too overacted, and for a hunger game movie it was kind of boring?  meh. ",2024-03-27
"What I would have liked to see was more closure with Lucy Gray and Coryo Snow. I mean the movie is pretty clear about what happened, but I still feel like I have questions. Why does Lucy even decide to meet up with Coryo at all? He pretty much already reviled his evilness. Why does she decide to run away when they're at the cabin and not before? Honestly, seeing Coryo alone made me feel bad for him. Do you think that if she hadn't run away from him, he would have still killed her. Also, that part is confusing, if he actually killed her or did she get away? I think that he wouldn't have. The whole time watching them run away I was thinking I know that it wouldn't work out (their escape), but I really hope it does. I would love to hear other people's ideas about what I said.",2024-04-05

"This should have been a 10 episode series. Everything felt rushed and weightless. There is a lot happening and they dont feel dramatic and impactful. I didnt care about the main girl who didnt have a life or personality other than singing. Also, her acting was bare minimum. Lawrence put her heart in it in the first two films. I didnt care about the tributes. Scary / bully ones didnt feel so. And the ones we were supposed to root for didnt have enough screen time for us to care. The whole conspiracy / rebellion thing in District 12 was also rushed, so the betrayal didn’t work for me either. The only thing that worked for me was Snow. Great acting and him sticking to his values (and sociopathy lol) and walking a fine line between black n white was well executed.

"Would love some takes on this

I just got around to seeing the movie finally tonight. 
I understand that snow is a narcissistic sociopath, HOWEVER hear me out ;

He yelled out at one point to Lucy Gray that he “Did everything for her”, which is true. I feel like my problem is with Lucy Gray and not with Snow now… I KNOW THIS IS A HOT TAKE.
Snow killed the mayors daughter to protect Lucy. He knew that she hated Lucy and would somehow drag her into the escape when yelling on them, in my opinion. When Lucy ran into the room his first instinct was to protect her, when her ex-boyfriend kept touching her on stage, he protected her. Then bringing it back to the beginning of the film he asked is it was real and I believe he truly was in love with her. My issue is I thought she understood everything he was doing was to protect her, and that he loved her until he said “You wouldn’t tell thought, would you?” And she paused and was a terrible liar. Which was instant betrayal in his mind. He believed she really was in love with him but I feel like I can’t see it from her point of view, so I feel his actions are completely validated. I love reading everyone’s take and interpretation so I would love your take on this!",2023-12-06
"This book rekindled the spark that reading used to give me. I devoured it in couple days and was very excited to see the movie yesterday evening. It did not hold up to my expectations unfortunately.   
It was the longest book of all Hunger Games one and it was not split into 2 movies like Mockingjay. I get that they had to cut a lot of characters and events out of the book but changing the personalities of people was too much. Snow was made way dumber than in the books and Lucy Gray was made into a hysterical mess in few scenes which were out of their characters. SPOILER like in the last scenes, where she was yelling at him to tell her who's the 3rd person and in the cabin when she was the one who told him he can leave for the military training as they found the guns. I saw the movie with my husband who has not read the book and he found the movie confusing. He thought that the last scene was about Lucy Gray leaving the guns in the cabin to frame him. A lot of things were too straightforward and on the other hand motives of characters were not true to the books and made no sense.  
SPOILER Killing off presidents son, Dr Gaul portrayed as a psycho, it was too much for me to handle.  
I was really disappointed and pissed when we left the cinema yesterday and I had to re-activate my account just to rant about it LOL  
Book is really fun to read so I recommend you read it! I'm glad I got to before watching the movie.",2023-12-09
"My biggest problem with the movie versus the book is I didnt think they built up the relationships between the characters enough. I also don't think the change of heart Coriolanus had in the cabin towards the end was obvious enough. My bf didnt read the book and he couldnt tell that Coriolanus was changing his mind about running off with Lucy Gray after he found the guns. It wasn't clear enough. So when Snow was bit by the snake, to my bf, it looked more like she turned on him first so he had a right to try and kill her. It seemed like that to me too, and I read the book. Another blame the woman scene as she caused his mood to shift. I didnt like that part at all. It should have been made more obvious that he was going to turn on her way before he was bit by the snake.",2023-12-12

Is the movie gory? I’ve read all the books except for TBOSBAS but I’ve only watched the first 2 movies. Gore bothers me quite a bit so I had to close my eyes in the first movie for the bloodbath and Cato’s death but overall I found the movies less gory than they were described as by reviews and stuff. A big group of my friends are going to see the ballad of songbirds and snakes but I’m not sure if I would be ok with it. Lots of reviews have said it’s much more close up and gory.

With that said, what’s the deal with Peter Dinklage and his tie to Lucy and Sejanus? Snow brought him Sejanus’ belongings because he knew what they were already or was responsible for those poison vials? 

And him having sent Lucy on the train with a warning about Snow, was there something more going on between him and the rebellion?",2023-12-04

So does Lucy Gray eventually have a daughter and name her Katniss? Or does she influence many rebels up north (with her songs) and one of those rebels has a daughter that they name Katniss? It is pretty clear there is some sort of direct link or at least influence... Also want to mention a songwriter with her voice would be very very influential and Taylor Swift style singing about ex boyfriend Snow...

"I thought it was good. The first half of the movie id probably rate it a 9.5/10. The breaking point was just the way it went from an action packed lean forward in bed movie to a very slow king dialogued film that had so many damn things going on at once. I rate it a solid 8. 

Very cool to see the transition of Snow from good to evil. As soon as he shaved his head from leaving the capital and becoming a peace keeper,  he put on the Eminem slim shady vibe. What I’m confused on is why he had issues with the small teacher in the first place. If he was honest and upfront with snow in the beginning couldn’t they have like intentionally made the games a shit show so they’d be ended?",2024-01-02
I genuinely enjoyed book because of its subtle hints and portrayal of Snow. Movie was a bit disappointing. It painted Snow in a better light and at same time made him cruel for no reason. What I mean is in the book it is clear that he is cruel but it’s done with purpose here purpose was absent. Also trust Lucy and Seajunus had for him was so deep and it was lost in the film. Overall it felt a bit rushed but watchable. I genuinely loved actors and I think they did great job with what they had to work with. I am aware that my view is biased because I loved book so much. I don’t think any version of the film would have matched the actual book for me.,2024-01-29

"I've been thinking about this. How come the Harry Potter movies, which were mostly 12A/PG-13, were able to get away with so much blood?

Instead, the end result was laughable and completely gutted of the impact it should have had. The blood was essential to both the realism and the effect on Snow, because it triggers PTSD flashbacks for him in the book (of, for example, his mother's bloody death). I'd have preferred for it to be cut than what we got.

Harry Potter also had [George's bloody ear injury](https://blogtuoitre.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cac-cau-than-chu-trong-harry-potter-7.jpg), for another example.

I don't remember what year these stories are meant to take place, but definitely seemed like a 1950s/60s Cold War style in the broadcast reminiscent of the real-life Golden Age of Television. The Capitol evokes that same era too, maybe more Soviet than America (cmon, look at that statue). If you go back and look at Hunger Games or Catching Fire, the Capitol architecture has become much more Fascist/Brutalist.

They're both survivors now, and not like in the romanticized sense, but more like a state of brokenness.

"As an architect, I loved the set design/urbanism involved

\-The Capitol was mainly filmed in Berlin, so the roundabout that you see with the Victory Statue is at Straussberger Platz on Karl Marx Allee (Formerly Stalin Allee). It was an area of east Berlin that was completely rebuilt in the 1940s-50s in Stalinist Architecture/Soviet Classism, (albeit with CGI). You also get a nice 'Flashback' in the beginning between the dark days and the closing stages of WW2, with the complete destruction of Warsaw and devastation of Berlin and Budapest. 

\-I do like however that despite the Stalin Allee was at the time the 'new postwar style' the facades we see are tired/still undergoing renovation and you have a sea of towers rising up behind them, possibly alluding to the Postwar Economic boom in Germany, or just how the aesthetics have changed post-dark days for something 'Flashier' which would later translate into clothing 60 years later (also similar to how after the fall of communism, Berlin, Warsaw and Moscow have embraced International Style Glass and Steel Towers in their city centers).

\-We also see for a minute the Berlin Altes Museum as the Academy, which is a glorious Classical Building which serves to remind us of the Classical Roman influence in the Capitol, and while not related to the Building's purpose as an Art Gallery, this was were Coryo began to navigate the cut-throated-ness of Capitol Politics similar to Roman Politics. 

\-The Arena is the Wroclaw (formerly) Breslau Centennial Arena which was one of the first structures in 1913 to use reinforced concrete, and despite being 'Modern' still serves to have some elements of Decor and harken to a coliseum, vs a modern day football stadium.

\-The showdown with Highbottom takes place in the Monument to the Battle of Nations (Battle of Leipzig) and its interesting to note that this and the arena were both built in 1913, to commemorate the victory over Napoleon in 1813.

Up until when he sends the mockingjay recording (which made no sense: why not just TELL the Commandant, if you are gonna betray Sejanus).  

I _wish_ theyd shown him as an unadulterated sociopath. Perhaps they should have _showed_ us his true nature (which they did not), that he was really stringing everyone along, but then (perhaps) he's fallen in love and questioning his character, so he has a true choice, to be Good or to be Evil.  ...And he apparently chooses Evil.",2023-12-21

">3rd act felt rushed and Snow made a 180 very quickly

IMO, the biggest issue with both the movie and the book is that Snow likely didn't do a 180. Sociopathy isn't developed over time. He was always a sociopath that cared only about himself (and how people viewed him). Showing empathy or other emotions when no one was watching or when it didn't benefit him is a clear flaw in the story. 

Worth noting that sociopaths don't always know they're sociopaths, which was clearly the case here. Snow could think he was falling for Lucy Gray because that was key to manipulating her. But as soon as their relationship was no longer for his benefit, he would have stopped caring.",2023-11-17
"I’ve never read the books so I can’t speak to it, but in the film it didn’t seem to me Snow did a 180. It was more that his nakedly self-interested decision-making became more amoral and extreme as his situation became more desperate.

The film did a good job of establishing the pathology Snow developed being the son of a fallen, ""once great"" family of the Capitol. It really informed and made sense of all his decisions and motivations: why he’s desperate to win the Plinth Prize money, why he so strongly identifies with fellow poor, hungry, displaced orphan Lucy, why he was willing to sell out his spoiled best friend whose life everything his ""should"" be, and why he so quickly turned on Lucy as the final ""loose end"" once he found the guns.",2023-11-19

"I absolutely loved how the movie handled Snow’s character, because it didn’t present him as a black and white villain. He was shown as a child, and then as an 18 year old young man from an important yet now disgraced family, trying to earn their way back in the midst of the usual Capitol corruption, and slowly discovering his hunger for that goal that supersedes any connection or moral standing.

This isn’t to make us love or justify what he became at the end, but it’s also shows a realistic depiction of a young man who wasn’t just born a “villain”, but gradually descended into the dark side we see him at.

Some seem to complain that he’s a “sociopath” and all his emotions are fake, but that’s not necessarily the case. We don’t have to define every villain as a “sociopath” or whatever label that comes with a set of fixed traits. People can be quite complex. One person may be a great father but a lying, cheating, murderous gangster. One doesn’t justify the other of course.

In this case, Snow was a complex character. He felt love for the girl, and he also felt love towards Tigris and his family’s honor and image, and he had aspirations of his own.

When he was about to stay with Lucy Gray and spoke with Tigris on the phone, he was clearly conflicted between his goals towards his family name, lifestyle and career goals vs. his love life, friendships and the whole package that comes with them. And he had one foot in and one foot out on everything.

In a way, I feel Lucy Gray is also complex in her own way. She did seem to have feelings for him, but at the same time, part of her couldn’t trust him, and the other part wasn’t sure whether they’ll be able to live happily together, even if she fully trusted him, due to the differences in their outlook on life and capability to adapt. She spoke about how the Capitol isn’t for her, and he spoke about how life in 12 or outside isn’t his thing, either.

So both of them had their own conflicting emotions, wants and needs, and ultimately one of them succumbed to the darker side and the other chose to be free, and that’s what makes the story so amazing. They were realistic characters who fell in love, but were both too young, too different and their youth and difference in upbringing and outlook on life made their ability to continue together to be impossible.

Sometimes people’s relationships fall apart not because they don’t love each other, but because they love other things more, and Snow loved his life goals, regardless of their cost and morality and she couldn’t live with that.",2023-11-18

I feel like they did not flesh out parts of the story enough, or delve into the intentions or implications of their actions. I understand that we cannot have Snow's internal monologue in the movies, but I wish there was some way to at least show some of it. 

For me, I also wish they didn't change the scene where Clemensia gets bit by the snakes, because it was so much more suspenseful and unsettling in the books as they didn't know what was happening until it was too late. Also, they made it seem like she deserved it bc she lied, but I remember in the books he was okay with her name on the proposal too since she was so upset about her classmate's death, and was horrified about what happened. 

This is important bc it was almost another turning point in the book where Snow really saw how cruel, ruthless, and unhinged Dr. Gaul was. In fact, I wish they hadn't cut out the aftermath and how Dr. Gaul continued to experiment on Clemensia either bc it further showed how insane and how far she was willing to go, with ease. Of course, there were many reasons for Snow's descent into madness, but personally I think his growing fear of Dr. Gaul throughout the book had a substantial influence on his actions too. Just the overall horror of it all probably cemented the idea that he needed to ""land on top"" to protect himself, making it easier to later justify his actions. And thus the descent.",2023-11-25

Is the book good? I've been wanting to read it,2023-12-06
Movie didn't really show it that well,2024-02-25
I could've done without Dinklage's death scene. Something a little more subtle would've gone a longer way imo.,2023-11-26

Snow basically used all of Lucy Grey’s donations for that water bomb kamikaze.,2023-12-11
"My favorite character because he was so absurdly oblivious and socially awkward for being a magician and weatherman. He just accepts the Games as part of life because he's too dimwitted to have an opinion on it's morality. He's not evil - just oblivious. But he has a ton of great one-liners and I loved how Schwartzman played it.

""Tuberculosis on legs"" is simultaneously the film's funniest and most wicked line.",2023-11-20
"yeah i’m honestly thankful i read the book for this movie. felt necessary in order to understand the actual depth behind each scene. it was cool to see it all come to life and the chemistry was great between the two main characters but yeah it definitely did feel like my imagination while reading 😭
hopefully a rewatch will help. also did NOT help i read the book a week prior lol so ofc im gonna compare it harshly",2023-11-18
Gosh yes her accent was so distracting the entire time. It was like all I could focus on,2023-11-28
"So, Snow ""descended into madness""?  Everyone on the thread (or who has read the book) is saying he was sociopath from the very beginning.  [And, apparently, the movie was hiding this from the audience.]",2023-12-21
"I was picturing the Broncos stadium the whole time, was a bit disappointed to see the brutalist architecture and a really small arena",2023-11-24
"> -Everything up through Snow becoming a Peacekeeper felt really long, everything after felt really rushed. Snow descending into madness needed more time. 

This wasn't really all that different from my experience with reading the book. Although I felt the pacing more in the book, whereas the movie felt like a bullet train in comparison. The adaptation (for what they chose to focus on) was really well done - I do wish they could've kept more of the character moments. Like how Jessup's mentor sends in the water herself because she knows he's going to die and would rather Coryo save his water. Instead he tells her to do it and there is no alliance. The lack of Coryo's internal monologue really suffers due to how the movie never really takes much time to establish many character dynamics beyond the surface level.",2023-12-09
They somewhat did through his sister when he tells her he liked the feeling killing the tribute gave him. That was when the alarm bells started going off cause before that all his actions seem at least understandable even if u disagree. Even killing the tribute was understandable because you believe he does it so Lucy will have one less person to worry about. He did it out of love but then at the end you start to question that.,2023-12-03
I loved snows sisters character. She was clearly trying to steer him in the right direction. She went through everything he went through as a child and still had lots of empathy as an adult. And she was willing to go through the burdens of borderline poverty and homelessness if it meant not sacrificing her beliefs/values. She never once pressures snow to go all out to win the games. It’s always snow who puts all the pressure on himself.,2023-12-03
That was my thought and then he's like just use it in case you need to win,2023-11-19
Yeah I thought that initially too lol,2023-11-20

Same here! What a missed oportunity. A quick close-up shot of his face would have been a nice final touch.,2023-11-18
It would have been cool if like it flashes to him right before the The reaping of the 75th annual hunger games that would be really cool. But I hope that there's going to be at least some other filler content or like a TV show or something to kind of bridge the gap because I would still love to see some more of this universe and this world and how this old hunger games story kind of grows throughout time.,2023-11-19
People don't understand that this means you'd have to pay the actor who played old Snow even just for one shot. By just using his voice they don't have to pay him.,2024-01-03

"I'm going to listen to the book right now because everyone's saying he's a sociopath and that like he hates katniss but like I see it the other way around that he likes katniss because I feel like if you really hated katniss he got it done so much more.

But throughout the stories he was always trying to give katniss a chance by warning her trying to get her to help him corral PanAm and be that fear-inducing thing that he was and I feel like if he really hated her he would not have done that.

But like everything he did to people was also done to him. I'll see how I feel once I read the book and I kind of get a better understanding of him through the book rather than the movie which kind of biased me towards him rather than against him.",2023-11-19

Another theory was that she was Coin herself, something not true in the film series, but was just as plausible for the same reasons in the books.",2024-01-10
"I don't think it's out of the question that Sejanus might have a bit of a crush on Snow. Less so in the movie than in the book, but it's still there.

Gotta give him credit though. He ushered in 64 years of success at the games before that?,2023-11-18
"Agreed! I went in having read about the ""rushed 3rd act"" but came out totally confused by the criticism. 

Snow was already a jaded, selfish person at the beginning of the movie - losing his friend and Lucy - well that destroyed what little empathy he had for others left. In the end, he's just a selfish, bitter, power hungry little social climber. Not far off from what he was at the beginning of the movie. I don't think it was the movie's job to transform him into the Snow we know by the end of it. Even in the end, he didn't seem ""evil"" just spiteful and greedy. Who knows what atrocities he has to commit in order to reach the Presidency. I'm fine with them not showing that part of his life though. It was still a fitting end all in all.",2023-11-17

Billy ultimately was just a drunk who was also a rebel, and that's all we needed to know to ""side"" with Snow. Billy and Mayfair's deaths should have been more tragic, and Spruce and Sejanus should've been more devastating.

"Good write up of points.

In regards to your Sejanus character question - he was annoying but I felt like that was the point. He was meant to be a bit of a naive eye roller (going into the arena to mourn his friend that didn’t even like him?) but to me sang true to form. 

I’m not sure if I was personalising his character (and not to get political at all) but his character rang very true to me - I know people like Sejanus in real life. I have family members that post eco-warrior tirades on Facebook while they drive BMW’s and fly jets overseas. The irony of the 1% who are educated enough to parrot the moral high ground whilst living a life of luxury.

I know the writer has spoken before about her father serving in Iraq and I can see a bit of that here as well. I served in the military and the amount of people I’ve heard pour out their holier-than-thou do gooder charity spiels that would absolutely melt if they were dropped in a Middle Eastern warzone is staggering. Every Tom, Dick and Harry thinks they can solve and geopolitical issue from their dinner table but never even visit these places.

I felt like this was represented really well by Sejanus enlisting. His heart was in the right place, he wanted to help people but then when he got down to the nitty-gritty he was genuinely scared by the environment and died begging for his mummy.

Very aware my interpretation may be personal though.",2023-11-17

But I really liked how they set up the Games as a much more raw and barbaric games. It makes sense that the Districts wouldn't watch the Games because who wants to watch your children killing other children and vice versa? But the evolution of the Games to the spectacle with stylists, trackers and such from basically dumping 24 kids into a basic arena and telling them to slug it out was fascinating to see because it fit with the story.

The Games were on life support (no pun intended) because Capitol citizens were getting bored with them because they were short - hence why none of the Mentors prepared to be there longer than one day - and primitive with a bunch of teenagers grabbing weapons and swinging at each other. I'd like to see the evolution of Snow from Gamemaker to President as I think it would involve him pushing the 'spectacle' that the Games became and responsible for increasing it's ratings, introducing betting, etc.

The circle would then be complete. His father steals the drunken ramblings of Casca and turns it into the Games to get the credit and then Corio steals ideas from others to enhance the Games and raise his own profile.",2023-11-20

"As another comment mentioned, I really don’t think we need more of these split-part movies, though I think this one would’ve been better suited as a miniseries. Part One would’ve been portraying Snow as too sympathetic and as the clear hero while Part Two would veer too far the opposite direction, when his characterisation is more layered than that, and I think they did a decent job with him given the lack of an internal monologue you could get from the book. However, that might be more of a credit to Tom Blyth’s performance than the script.",2023-11-17
"I think make it one movie was the right call. If they had split it into two films, the first part would have ended with the end of the game.

There's nothing wrong with some criticism, but I feel like some people are really over dramatic about it.",2023-12-04
"One of my gripes is that the film should have shown more hints and nuances for audience to accept his change at the ending. I didn't read the book and it felt a bit out of nowhere and sudden.

"I agree I loved it!! I am not even particularly a fan of the franchise (I like it but only watched the movies, never read the books) but I *loved* this one. Definitely my favorite. While the other movies are entertaining, in my opinion for *me personally*, they stuck too much to the arena/game part (understandably, that's the whole point) and only in the final movie we kind of see interesting things (Panem, the war, politics, etc.)  


This movie is drastically different: politics, context, interesting characters driven by ambition, guilt, delusion, revenge... in other words, *believable* complexity. A love story much more interesting and endearing that the rather lame ones in the trilogy, full of conflict yet still pretty realistic... We see more of the security/military aspect and how it works from within... And the main actor kills it.  


I might rewatch it again! I hope for a sequel!",2023-11-23

"> Sejanus is really just a foil with more screen time than he deserved in this movie

Yeah, for ""the conscience"" of the movie, he didnt really _do_ anything.  He volunteers to go to Area 12 because Snow was sentenced to 20 years there??  Then, he gets money to the rebels and (Oh My!) theyve bought some guns with it? (Also: I thought he was the Presidents son-- and couldnt be hanged??) He's just doing dumb things that are obviously going to be found out and he's too smart a person to be doing the things he's supposed to have done.  

> Snow’s character; the 2.5 hours successfully turns a charismatic, empathetic young man into a now-iconic literary villain    

He only became a villain in last 5 minutes of the movie, with very little foreshadowing. (His premeditated betrayal of Sejanus just comes off as confusing: he doesnt act villainous before or after the betrayal.)",2023-12-21
"I liked it but I agree wholeheartedly that the accents were horrible and music was a bit rough. Sometimes Lucy sounded british, sometimes she sounded like Forrest Gump. 

The music is a bit like the hobbit, I understand it’s in the book and I like a faithful adaption but I just don’t think the songs translate.

Particularly the one where Lucy was being wrapped in CGI snakes, starts out okay like panicked humming and then she’s suddenly performing musical theatre to the camera with instrumental. Cringe worthy.",2023-11-17

"I think in this case part 1 would have been amazing because it would have ended with the games ending. And that alone would have made a great movie I could have walked away after he was sent to the military and well I would have had questions I would have been content.

But then when part 2 would be announced and I'd be like what the second movie just wouldn't be as good how could you justify just the district part of the movie. I feel like if they could have done a part two where it starts with him out in district 12 she betrays him and then it goes back to the capital and him interacted with periodiclich again and killing him and then moving on to where he likes does his next year The hunger games and it ends right there that could have been interesting but you would have to add a lot the book it didn't actually have in the first place.

It's not a movie in one single movie this should have been done as like an HBO series and maybe start it up a longer running franchise that continues the journey of snow and all these various characters as well as even the rebels and how they get to the point of The hunger games and then maybe even doing a complete retelling of the original Three books and have it be this mega TV show that kind of follows all of The hunger games and all of the ins and outs maybe it skips a good amount of time throughout but eventually comes up to where we are at the end of Mockingjay and then maybe there's more to follow after that.",2023-11-19

"I read the first three books and enjoyed them about the same as the movies, i.e., I didn't really like the third book or third movies much.

I haven't read this prequel book, but I just saw the movie, and I liked a lot about it, e.g., it shows the origin of the games and even the early stages of the capital.  But there was also quite a bit it got wrong, like Snow's quick turn at the end, all of the singing and often in silly ways, and the bad pacing of the third act that was a bit murky and thrown together.  Like, why would a rich guy like the game master just take drugs some guy he hates throws on the desk?  That's just one example.

It was better than I thought, though, and since I did generally enjoy the first books it has me interested in reading this prequel book, but I'd still say at least the first two moves are better than this one.  It did have good parts, though.",2024-02-20

Of course you would choose going back home to your family like nothing ever happened.

I feel like if you really loved the girl he would have found a way to bring her back with him. Obviously people found their way into the capital if seJanus did.

"> Don't understand the mixed reactions at all, to me this was the best hunger games movie by a wide margin.

Agree.  I found the earlier films formulaic and predictable and hated Peeta as a hack actor.  

> Snows turn was pretty well communicated.   

It was?!

OK, but why does he ""turn"" then, at the cabin?  If he was going to betray her, why would he wait till he'd gone AWOL from base and was miles away from any settlement. Why go crazy at the cabin? (And what _was_ that gun there? They only stopped there bc he wanted to fish rather than press on, so it was coincidence they stopped there anyway. [I wont even ask what a fully furnished, unlocked, unoccupied cabin is doing in the middle of nowhere.] Did Snow ""figure out"" that she was part of the rebels because the guns were there? But.. she said fishing poles were there. It was guns-only, no poles? Why did she tell him to look there if there were guns not fishing poles. Wait-- why would someone hide fishing poles under the floorboards in the first place?  So many questions about that scene....)

And, finally, WHY would he betray her? She wasnt a rebel. She had nothing to do with the gun deal, did she?",2023-12-21

Hard disagree on the series part. Don’t think it would’ve gotten as much interest/attention as a series and risks people losing interest when things switch from movies to series.,2023-11-17
Agreed about the cinematography. The shot from below looking up at snow holding his mothers scarf and his face slowly changing was great. It reminded me of the scene in Dexter where trinity (played by John Lithgow) enters an elevator and when the door closes his facial expression changes from the mask to his real self.,2023-11-19

Because it's not really a switch he's still a decent person at this point he's not completely a psychopath but he realizes now especially after being in the games at one time that and the way he was raised during the war he has no family he had no moral guiding structure but to survive and so I think he miss associates killing and getting what's out of your way out of your way so you can continue trudging forward.

And so he just develops like you know what they deserve to die. It's a thought we all have we watch movies and TV shows or reason people in real life that do really messed up evil things you just think well they should have died. That can easily be Miss done if you have the incorrect moral system or moral guidelines of what constitutes that endpoint.

Honestly it's the same decision that katniss made at the end of Mockingjay. She decided to kill I forget her name the lady that runs district 13 instead of killing snow because she realized what she would be allowing. But also she did it because she killed her sister.",2023-11-19

I feel like Studios need to start making like a movie for the theatrical release that kind of is like what we're watching now but then actually shoot an extra hour and a half of movie and then on like a DVD release or like on streaming there's like an extended cut so that you can come back and there's more explanation and it's more expounded out because I definitely could see another like hour of this movie but I don't think I could sit in the theater for another hour for that movie but I could definitely do it at home.,2023-11-19

"You never find out which is the point. The film is largely from Snow's POV as it's his story so we see Lucy Gray through Snow's eyes as you said. There are times where it genuinely seems like she loves him - she did risk her freedom and life to save him in the arena after all - there are other times where it seems like it's an act. Snow was absolutely in love with her which is what bore the quote ""It's the things we love most that destroy us"".

The same ambiguity existed with the gun in the cabin. Would Snow actually shoot her to eliminate a 'loose end'? The way it's shot is it doesn't matter if he would've - the point is Lucy believed he might and she was so close to freedom that she couldn't take any chances. She had just survived the Games and illegally running away north so at that point she was all-in and Snow's demeanor made her think that if it wasn't right then, he might decide down the road she was too much of a risk.

Since we're looking at it through Snow's eyes, we see Lucy Gray for the last time through his soul. He thinks she was playing him but never really knows and part of him wants desperately to believe that she did/does love him. That's why I think that part stayed very true to the story.

If you're asking do I think that Lucy loved Snow - I think she did have those feelings for him but she also knew that he was still a Capitol citizen at his core and he had lied to her several times already so she knew she could never fully trust him so that was the genesis for her idea to run and snake trap the scarf.",2023-11-20

"She figured he killed Sejanus 

She also realized he was going to leave her without saying anything. 

So if he killed his best friend and is willing to drop her easily how can she trust him?",2023-11-17
"My interpretation:

- obviously a theme hit at the end that people are in a “hunger game” every day, could kill eachother at any time.

- I think as you said, she was scared of him. She suspects he killed his best friend and then he slips up that he killed someone else he hasn’t told her about. If he kills all these people so easily, why wouldn’t he kill me?

- she’s already feeling unsure but the scene in the cabin (again my interpretation), she feels directly threatened. He finds the guns that link him to the murders and they both ponder out loud that it’s the only evidence, which leaves Lucy as the only loose end. He asks if she would ever expose him and I believe she reads it as “because if you would, then I’ll kill you”. She assures him she wouldn’t but makes the mental decision to leave, grabs a knife to defend her self and makes up the story about going to look for food. 

- My interpretation is you see Snow consider killing her and going back to the capital because well he’s a psycho, but he internally decides against it because he likes Lucy (and he thinks she likes him) and shakes his head to go fishing. 

- Once he realises she has left, he gets offended/frustrated because he feels as if she’s betrayed him. I think it leaves it open to the viewer whether he is right or not. She could have just been using him the whole time and there’s subtle hints throughout (kiss hesitation, she alludes to missing her ex, he asks her if her affection is “real”). He then decides to definitely kill her and return to power and wealth because love isn’t real ya da ya da ya da.

- he obviously fails because she’s more capable than he gave her credit for. I think he lies to his boss that he got bit by a snake and passed out as opposed to trying to escape, que end of movie.",2023-11-17
"They 100% explained it in the movie earlier in a short line about trust.

She was clear that trust was the most important factor for her in life.  When Snow said he killed 3 people and hesitated she knew immediately he lied and she couldn't trust him. He knew too. It was over after that one way or another, finding the gun was just the option that presented itself... or maybe she even know it was there and she pushed him to find it as a way to escape",2023-11-18
"It was a tragedy. She ran because of him turning in his best friend, but she doesn't understand just how bad the situation was with the friend's actions continuously putting him and others in danger and why it was basically necessary to ensure they both could survive.  

He sacrifices almost everything so he can run off with her, she bails out of fear he would turn on her eventually, and it hardens him, as he is left wondering if she ever loved him.",2023-11-19

"The director is the same as the director for Catching Fire and Mockingjay, and he said doing press for this movie that he considers splitting Mockingjay up was a mistake.

Kind of ironic, though, because I feel like someone probably floated that idea for this movie and it was immediately dismissed since Mockingjay (alongside Harry Potter) was one of the BIG examples of a finale hurting itself by doing that. Also assuming the studio didn't think this series still held enough power to have two successful box office outings or to commit to a second movie before seeing how the first one did. 

That said, yeah this should have been split up or mini series'd.

Edit: Didn't mean to imply Harry Potter finales were bad. I guess I mean people were getting really tired of the 2 part finale trend that HP kind of started and the general idea was that it was a trend rooted in greed. Companies who knew their cash cow was almost at an end and wanted one more year of box office or viewership from it. Harry Potter 7 came out in the early 2010s, Breaking Bad split its final season into two in 2013, and Mockingjay was 2015. By then it felt derivative and unnecessary for Mockingjay.",2023-11-17

And I wanted to see a better transition of the distrust between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray. I felt that switch happened so fast. Also, give me more time between them finding each other again. Walk me through the torment Coriolanus experienced of being sent to District 12, being torn apart from his family, searching for her, not knowing if she was still alive.

As the districts start to sound like the Capitol new trends arise in Capitol speech, similar to the emergence of Received Pronunciation as a court/educated accent in England in the 18th/19th centuries, until we end up with the mid-Atlantic affectation sported by Effie.",2023-11-18

Mockingjay Part 2 is decent tbh. Part 1 is a literal filler in an anime manga.,2023-11-17

Totes,2023-11-17
I definitely agree with you but I do think the hunger games movies are really good outside of this. But this is definitely the best one like the production the the way it tugs are nostalgia it just does such a really good job and knocks it out of the park. Like the only big flies are maybe the the weirdness of the part 3 but that's more attributed to the story in the source materials and the actual movie itself so I'm not putting the movie to blame on that.,2023-11-19
"Yah I give this a slight edge over the original films cause I really liked Rachel Zegler(why do online people hate her, no idea) and well every other actor in this, whereas in the originals I kinda disliked hysterical mode Jennifer Lawrence, Peeta actor and stiff Liam Hemsworth but that's just me..

This one does seem to drag a little in the third act but the first 2/3rds are fantastic and gripping.",2023-11-29

"I'm pretty sure it was Peter Dinklage's character who said that the not knowing about Lucy will become what drives him mad and it's so true. With death, there's finality. He's left with his mind wandering. Where is she now? Is she safe? Does she have a husband, kids? Is she still singing? Was she shot dead? I think, and it could just be me, but it's as though Lucy is the only semblance of humanity he has left especially as he will eventually become President so in a way the unknown of her will forever haunt him. That's something he doesn't have control over.",2023-11-19

I think he hated Katniss too but in a different way. It was his pent up rage towards Lucy that flowed out as hatred towards Katniss because Katniss was remarkably similar in personality to Lucy. She obviously reminded him of her and used Katniss' participation in the Games as a way to channel revenge towards Lucy for 'betraying' him.,2023-11-20
"I really enjoyed reading your take on the central romance, as portrayed in the movie, and I think this is a good summary of the main themes and the opposing forces at work within the romance. I'm pleased that you were able to get this much from just the movie version (I'm assuming you haven't read the book); it shows that the film told its story successfully!

>close friend

Slight quibble here. Sejanus was not really Snow's ""friend"", never mind a close one. Perhaps the movie didn't make that clear enough..? But I suppose he was from Lucy Gray's and other people's POV.",2023-12-16
Where would you rank it?  Third best HG movie for me,2023-11-20
"The descent happened too fast I thought when he told his sister he liked how it made him feel to kill that tribute. Up until that point he is cold but not some cold blooded killer. As the audience, it’s easy to understand why he makes the choices he does til that point. Even killing the tribute was understandable if you believed he loved Lucy. But saying what he said after was a big turn and could’ve revealed some of his inner thoughts he was having. Since it’s not a book we don’t hear those thoughts so in a way I guess maybe that wasn’t too fast either.

Also even when he’s making suggestions on how to bring more views to the hunger games, he seems very cold.

When you realize Lucy is the only thing/person (at that point snow probably saw her more as a thing) that can stop him from having full freedom from his crimes, I thought it made sense he’d go a little made. Lucy was  always a rebel and never showed anywhere close to snows calculated cold side. So when she was the one to bring up the elephant in the room, I found it believable snow was gonna do something stupid.",2023-12-03
"100% agree about the tone of the reaping ceremony. It seemed too playful and high school musical. The stakes of the games were completely absent and it stayed like that all movie. Snow and Sejanus (??) seemed to care more about the morality of the games than any of the tributes.

Back to Lucy... even in the zoo cage she was still smiling and treating everything lightly. I understand she was ""performing"" but there was no nuance in the character's emotion, not even a quick flicker of fear or dread. it was hard to connect with her, to the point where I didn't care if she lived or died.

Her singing voice is beautiful though.",2023-12-23

"> the fact that she was able to win the hunger games despite never once picking up a weapon.

So? She's not really a combatant, and survives because her mentor is cheating on her behalf. The Hunger Games are not some merit contest.",2023-11-18
"Agreed. Zero clarity on Snow’s motivations. His descent into madness is extremely rapid and unexplained. Couldn’t stand Rachel Ziegler’s acting. I had to hold back laughter in scenes that were supposed to be serious. The script was so fucking cringe to me. I like Tom Blyth as an actor and he obviously had to work with what he was given, but damn all of the other capitol kids were awful actors. I know they were going for balance with seasoned actors, but even their performances didn’t do it for me. Viola Davis was way too goofy and Idk why Jason’s lines were so cringe to me. It felt like they wanted him to be like Cesar so bad but it wasn’t doing it for me. It felt like a marvel movie",2023-11-18

"I’m curious, did you read the books? I’m not shading, but trying to read your comment with the correct lens. 

Because I find it *so* interesting how you described Snow as sociopathic. During the movie (specifically after he said the “powerful” thing to Tigris), I thought to myself how they were depicting Snow as very sociopathic instead of what I thought of him as, which is narcissistic. And the two aren’t mutually exclusive, but his internal monologue in the books really shows how his motivation for all his decisions is incredibly narcissistic and by removing that monologue in the film, he seems devoid of emotion and thus sociopathic.",2023-11-17
"The book delves into the future of the games a bit more.  Mostly with Snow.  Both with the betting and gifts, but also Snow noticing that people in the districts didn't even pay attention to it or even have a way to watch, so the manditory watching and the prizes for the district that wins along with the victory tours are added for the 11th games (that Mags wins, she does the first ever victors tour).",2023-11-18

"It was explored Snow's dad is the one who came up with the idea. That's who was behind the first hunger games. The doctor and the professor were both people also who responsible for creating it. The doctor mad scientist lady she was the one who's been the game maker for the last 10 years. The professor was the one who came up with the idea but never wanted his idea to come into fruition because it was just a joke.

And what it took was kind of obvious so you got to see like the devastation they went through people were literally eating other people to survive during this war it was horrific loved ones were dying left and right when you're in that kind of position as a group of people you have a lot of hatred towards the other side of that battle. And you become blind to like certain things. So asking for 24 kids every single year honestly didn't seem that bad in that moment but after 10 years it started to die down people were disinterested the games are on the verge of dying out because people just were like this is kind of messed up to a point.

but then this happens and the story happens and that's what reawakened this kind of love for it and they they buy humanizing these people it also dehumanize them because now they're just spectacles they're just like people on a movie screen they're not actual people by celebritising these people they send to the hunger games that's basically dehumanizing them even though they're acknowledging how human they actually are.

Originally they were all just throwing that arena we saw in an empty room coliseum style and they duked it out. But then this happens and the arena is blown up and destroyed and it adds this new kind of interest to people rather than people just being thrown in arena and dying it adds this element of like story to it or people are hunting other people down and all that very similar to how moves and TVs are today for us we're basically watching fake hunger games in a lot of TV shows out there.

At the end of the day it all still is kind of stupid and illogical. But this is the universe of a story that's a battery out for children there's not much logic to be had there.

I thought the only realistic way this would actually happen with the actual humanity sees things morally when it comes to women and children in times of war would be if the kids had to volunteer to be in it and by volunteering you would basically become ultra rich and have food and you're starving before and then it kind of turns it around to where they're not there because they have to be they're there because they want a shot to not be in the Life they're living now like that's the only way you could justify an actual hunger games being realistic and that's not the case here it's more of a punishment but it's all meant to fit that original premise so there's no honestly any kind of way we would all understand on how you get to that point",2023-11-19
That part was what saved the movie for me. The first parts was kinda boring and annoying. But the acting from the male actor and the story progression in part 3 saved it.,2023-11-28

"I think that was the only scene I actively disliked. It was way too over the top and unrealistic. They could’ve left it at her putting the snake in that girls dress which was still a bit ridiculous given the weight of the scene (just being picked for the hunger games).

It was an otherwise fantastic movie though. I felt the first singing scene should’ve come elsewhere though.",2023-12-03
"This book was longer than the original trilogy. The Ballad OSAS was almost 600 pages long, whereas the original trilogy had books that were 400 pages at most. So this movie had a lot to cover. Francis Lawrence said he regretted making Mockingjay into a two parter and wanted to avoid doing it this time around.

Though I will say that this was one of the most faithful book to screen adaptations I've ever seen. A few parts were missing though, like Sejanus's mother having a bigger role, the Capitol black market, and the funeral for the dead mentors. Some parts did feel less nuanced as most of the book was Coriolanus's internal monologue. However, I really did enjoy this movie, and I think they did a wonderful job at what they were given.

Snow stated in the movie that he thought Sejanus would get out of it - that his father would buy his way out, as he always had in the past - but that Snow would hang for it. He didn't know what would happen to Sejanus.

Also, Sejanus wasn't *really* Snow's true ""friend"". Snow's true loyalty is to himself first, and the Capitol second, though Lucy Gray gets in the way somewhat. Snow had a lot of resentment towards Sejanus even before he kept putting Snow's life and honour in danger, and they made that clear in one of the first scenes of the movie, when all the mentors were talking about Sejanus behind his back.",2023-11-18

I know ""make it longer"" doesn't sound like it would make it less boring but if you truly fleshed out Snow's ""turn to evil"" it would'nt have felt quite as ""out-of-nowhere"" which rendered everything kinda ""boring"" because it wasn't quite easy to follow if you hadn't read the book",2023-11-20

and the writing was shit, she did not seem to give af about the games at all. zero emotion about being in the games (and the added injustice of them purposely choosing her to fuck her over) and zero ptsd and emotion when the games were over. just la di da singing by the lake at summer camp. very weird character and corny acting. ",2024-03-27

"Lucy is the moral pillar throughout the movie. She was never going to do anything that bad to anyone including him. 

I thought snow was clearly power hungry from the start of the movie and it wasn’t necessary for Lucy to push him over the top. It was his whole life upbringing that led him down the path he went. I thought the movie did a good job of showing that. He’s very calculated the whole movie which included decisions to murder. And I understood why he chose murder in all the scenes he did but it’s still at the end of the day a murder. Also the scene when he said he liked how it made him feel when he killed the tribute was another clear sign snow was off regardless of what Lucy’s rejection was gonna be.",2023-12-03

Well that’s at least what i think but hopefully someone who knows more will chime in.,2023-12-20
"> What I wonder is, did Lucy ever love him?

That's a good question and I wonder too. I think between them, Snow cared more for Lucy than her for him. I think Lucy kind of had feelings for him because he was the only guy for her in the Capitol and she needed him for her survival. Although since both are attractive and Snow is kind to her, she does fall for him. However, once the games are over, I think Lucy moves on. Her life back in D12 matters more to her. Whereas Snow even after the Games is concerned about Lucy.

So I think Lucy's feelings for him were fleeting and that is why she easily abandoned him. She had a change of heart within a few minutes or hours even. Sure, what she learned and guessed about Snow was very serious stuff, but the fact that it ended so abruplty for her without any communication proves my point.

Snow was more into Lucy than she was into him. But in the end after Lucy's escape even Snow turns paranoid and starts hating her.",2023-12-24

"> And him betraying Sejanus was awful, but Sejanus put him in a really compromising situation.

Tbh, Sejanus was a real albatross. Snow would have been better off never knowing him. He was indirectly responsible for all three of the kills that set Snow on his inexorable slippery slope to villainy.

I also felt bad for Snow through much of the story of TBOSAS. He is *not* excused from his ultimate decision to commit to becoming a ruthless dictator.  However, I feel I *understand* him to some extent. The world was cruel to him. Other doors he might have gone through were closed in his face by the likes of Dean Highbottom. Having experienced the Hobbesian State of Nature at first hand during the war - the horror of witnessing humans scavenging human corpses in the streets like literal animals -  he was already ripe for Dr Gaul's ideological grooming. His later experiences of conflict in the arena and in District 12 - how scarcely controlled chaos is, how close to the surface the killer in man - only reinforced those beliefs. What he perceived as Lucy Gray's ""betrayal"" only solidified his cynicism about humanity.

Snow never really left ""bomb time"" during his youth - that state of powerlessness, of not knowing whether he would live or die. It's not *surprising* that he would prioritise security, control, and comfort in adulthood - even at the highest cost. And Gaul and Snow were not entirely wrong to believe that the only *choice* in an ""endless war"" between the Districts and the Capitol was between being the ""victor"" and the ""defeated"". A peace treaty never seemed an option. Indeed, if it weren't for Katniss' impulsive decision to assassinate Coin, Snow's Capitol would have become The Defeated - subject to a similar brutal and punitive regime to the one they had employed against their enemies. It's interesting to consider what one would do to ensure they remained the Victor.

The war may not have been ""endless"", after all, but it lasted Snow's entire lifetime. And was the primary form that war took for 74 years - a controlled, pseudo-war with a set number of casualties, staged within an arena, i.e., the Hunger Games - *not* preferable to the state of ""real war"" that Snow warned Katniss about: the sort that involves wholesale, indiscriminate slaughter and ""collateral"" deaths, such as those of Snow's mother and Prim? 

Interesting questions to ponder.",2023-11-28

"She figured out he killed his best friend and was worried he would kill her (the conversation where she’s the last “loose end” to the murders).

Snow considers killing her but decides against it. Once he realises she has abandoned him, I think he perceives this as she never loved him and it was all an act - then he decides to find and kill her.

practically waltzing up to the stage, without a care in the world? you just got picked for the hunger games!! the snake was silly, as if that’s her first thought to do,  and then she gets up on stage ‘give me a minute boooooys!’ and starts honkeytonk singing. dear lord. some highschool musical tv movie level acting and filmmaking. 


the og movies and actors did such a good job of conveying the absolute fear, desperation and disparity with the games. jennifer lawrence’s character was out of her mind with shock. her fear was palpable. then that fear turned to anger. great acting. 
lucy gray was like an alien the whole movie, just smiling in full dissociation in the whole time! it was bizarre. couldn’t relate to the character at all which is really not a good sign.



after the games the ogs had so much ptsd to deal with and yet here comes lucy gray as if nothing happened, back into honkeytonky mode lmao.

"A little devil’s advocate for your devil’s advocate. I have think of Snow’s conversation with Tigris about “remembering the tributes are human.” He didn’t intend to fall for Lucy in the first place. He planned to manipulate her (and the rest of the Capitol) into surviving for his own means (the Plinth Prize). Lucy Gray is smart. She KNOWS their connection is transactional. Snow has convinced himself he cares for her, but his true nature is selfish i.e. phrases like “I did everything for you” are emotionally abusive. So as an abuser archetype, he believed his actions were valid, and she saw through his BS.",2023-12-08

"The critics felt the movie was unnecessary, and had bad pacing.  Some critiqued actors acting too.  Basically saying the movie is a cash grab and lacks any reason for existing. Which is fucking stupid because it's based on a book.  It has a reason for existing because it shows Snows motivation and recontextualizes a lot.

Audiences like it BECAUSE it shows what happened to snow and WHY he hates katniss so much.  It's pretty faithful to the book and it's not a cash grab because it's based on a popular book that a lot liked (and some loved).  The reason critics have a problem with the pacing is because it's like the book and it's a SNOW MOVIE.  It's called Hunger Games, yes, but literally the main character is Snow like did they expect the entire movie to just be the Hunger Games?

Anyways they are wrong.  But for what it is worth it did go up.  64 percent fresh now and 91 user score.  7.2 IMDB on par with The Hunger Games.  Critics just don't like giving a better review for an old series that they didn't know the movie was based on a book.",2023-11-22

Coryo takes away the photos to give to Sejanus' parents and throws away Morphilin to trash bin next to Dean's desk saying ""it's no longer needed"". He knew Dean Highbottom will take it out of the trash, so he poisoned it before. In the epilogue of the book Snow already has sores in his mouth because of the poison.

SPOILER In the books Sejanus knew very well that he gives rebels the money for the guns as he was planning to run away with them to the North, where there were rumors about people living outside of Districts free of Capitol. Snow was wary of Sejanus as he was considered his closest friend even though Coryo despised him for being from the District 2. It could give Coryo hard time if Sejanus was caught, so when he noticed he was sneaking out of the concert he followed him. He walked into the scene like in the movies, but Mayfield was not there yet. Guy with the gun was a brother of the girl who was imprisoned during the execution of Arlo, her lover. When he saw Coryo he was nervous so Sejanus told him Coryo is with him and he won't tell a soul. Lucy Gray walked in and Billy Taupe said she is his girlfriend and she is running away with him. Mayfield was eavesdropping, walked in pissed and Coryo shot her as he was afraid that she will tell his father. Brother of the imprisoned girl shot Billy Taupe, took the guns and that was it.  
Then Coryo saw that that brother was caught by the peacekeepers and was afraid that the guns will be found soon as well. Guns that were used to kill Mayor's daughter, with his fingerprints, he would be hanged for that.",2023-12-09

"I guess it’s open to interpretation and mine was: Lucy makes a comment that the gun was the only evidence linking him to the murders of the mayors daughter/the boyfriend, if he got rid of those Lucy herself would be the only “loose end” stoping him from going back to his normal life.

They then share the tense exchange where Snow basically asks if he would ever to worry about her exposing him (because if that was a risk, he would have to kill her to ensure her silence). 

Lucy reads this immediately and promises him he has nothing to worry about before grabbing a knife and making up some excuse to leave. At this point, she’s worried that Snow has killed his best friend, lied to her about it and will now kill her with just as little remorse if it serves him.

She leaves, plants a snake trap in his mother’s momento and runs away. 

I think this also opens some ambiguity as to whether she ever even loved him or if it was just convenient to cater to Snow (she hesitates on their first kiss, alludes to missing her ex-boyfriend)

From Snow’s perspective, you can see he thinks about killing her in the cabin (or perhaps is just reflecting on his horrible actions) before deciding against it and proceeds to go fish. 

He then notices she has ran and takes personal offence to the betrayal - deciding to kill her as she obviously didn’t love him anyway (him asking if it was real earlier in the movie). He obviously fails but leaves anyway, telling his commanding officer he was attacked by a snake and passed out I guess?",2023-11-17
"She catches him in a lie about killing three people. She realizes he got his friend killed to get rid of loose ends that could endanger himself.

She also knows about his officer school offer and that he was planning on leaving her to go back to the capital. But the rifle or the rebel being found is an inevitable death sentence so his only choice is to flee.

They get to the cabin and discover the rifles that were hidden there by the other rebel (not lucy). His dna on the rifle and lucy are the last loose ends that could get him killed (""you wont tell anyone?"" - snow asking lucy in the cabin).

Lucy gets the fuck out of there asap because she thinks he is going to kill her, destroy the rifles, and get back to the capital.

The movie plays it off as a coin toss on wether he was going to kill her or keep fleeing north with her before the snake attack. 

Imo, him going into the forest after her with the rifle instead of leaving it in the boat is pretty clear indicator of his intentions. The snake attack was just justification on what he wanted to do in the first place (remember, he loved the feeling of killing the tribute kid).

He didnt want to help the rebels (never backing up plinth when he calls out the brutality), reform the system from within (his convo with lucy about the capital being civilized), or go north into the wild (he only agreed when forced by the rifle evidence). 

He loved plinth and lucy, but he didnt want to sacrifice his own desires to keep them.",2023-12-02

This is funny to me because this was my reaction reading the book but I thought the movie handled his switch much better,2023-11-20
Im with you on that. Understood most of the movie until then,2023-11-19
"So it started in the scene before. Snow accidentally revealed he killed three people, the third being Sejanus Plinth whom he didn't directly kill but his action of sending the recording lead to his death. He then poorly lied about it which Lucy noticed and lost trust in him. Remember that before she said trust was the most important thing to her.

Then they get to the cabin and when looking for a fishing rod he finds the gun he used to kill the mayor's daughter. The gun was the reason they were running as earlier they caught a murder suspect by finding his DNA on a gun. He can thus destroy the gun and be in the clear. Snow and Lucy talk about this and the fact that she would still be a loose end. She then leaves, in such a way it seems like she's afraid of Snow after the conversation. Snow then goes fishing, so he probably wasn't planning on killing Lucy at this point. But Lucy is nowhere to be found, Snow realizes she ran away, looks for her, gets caught in the trap she left to presumably slow him down, and now feels super betrayed so he tries to kill her and completes his transformation into the evil Snow we know from the original movies. Another interesting tidbit is his cousin at the end says he looks just like his father, calling back to earlier when she said the main thing she remembered about his dad was that all she saw in his eyes was hate.",2023-11-25
Yea I didn’t read the books. My friend and I were completely confused right after they left the district and went into the forest. Almost as if something was missing in between,2023-11-20

"> Can you explain the cabin scene ? I literally don’t understand a single thing from that point and into the Forrest. It made zero sense

Lucy Gray talks to Snow about how trust is the most important thing to her, more important than love. 

Snow slips up and says that 3 people killed are more than enough for him. His lie about having meant ""his old self"" as the third murder is not a very good one, we can assume that Lucy did not believe him. So now she doesnt trust him anymore. If she ever loved him, then thats irrelevant to her now. 

When they see the gun in the cabin, they come to the same conclusion. Get rid of it and hes a free man. Well, unless Lucy talks. Lucy is terrified at this point. She thinks Snow is gonna shoot her any second now, so she makes up a very flimsy excuse and leaves.",2024-01-07
Put simply in literary device terms: it’s a complete character and plot reversal. The discovery of the guns changes every circumstance and all trust is broken (just as it would be in the final moments in the arena). I think it reveals so much about the snake side of Lucy in that final chapter. The push and pull between the genuine and playing against each other. The movie did no justice to that cabin scene. Please treat yourself to chapter 30 at least. This book is a masterpiece in character study.,2024-01-04
I feel like in the book the inner dialog he has makes you feel more like he is capable of hurting her,2023-12-04
"And a developmentally disabled kid. Jesus. Bringing her into the mix was a good choice but also heartbreaking at the end (of the games, not movie).",2023-11-17
"I liked the choice, it really highlighted the difference between these games and the future games. It wasn’t a spectacle at this point (not much of one anyway), it was just a slaughter. At this point there wasn’t really any motivation to actually win the games beyond survival for the participants. A lot of districts were probably straight up rigging the reaping to send the ill, infirm, and unwanted instead of healthy children. Wasn’t until things like the victors village and winning districts getting supplies that some of the districts actually tried to win.",2023-12-03
"I think part of it was to emphasize how freshly out of war they were, how badly the districts were damaged from the war.",2023-12-31
Those were the changes Snow brought in later to groom the tributes before the games so the capitol didn’t feel so repulsed watching them,2023-11-18
And they were all filthy. Never washing for days barely having any food or water.,2023-11-19
I thought the one eyed and one armed kids were collateral damage from the explosion. They didn’t come to the Capital like that.,2023-11-22
"I mean, that's part of it, but iirc the Careers are only Districts 1, 2, and 4. The other 9 at the time were all reaped with the occasional volunteer. The 74th had young kids there, at least in the novel",2023-11-28
The outfits of the Capitol screamed 1940s/1950s but the Districts seemed 1920s/1930s. Half shocked the Luxury District didn’t have a flapper style female tribute,2023-11-27
The original trilogy was the same way.,2023-11-19
"I disagree! It’s a spectrum. You can care for other people (or think you do), yet still rationalize selfish behavior that hurts those same people.",2023-11-18
Literally just not what sociopath means. It's not even a real psychological term anymore and it wasn't a popular one in the first place.,2023-11-23
"I don't know about sincere, he lied to pretty much everyone about not benefitting from helping them. He was also unnecessarily brutal when killing the tribute. He could have left while he was on the ground without actually killing him. Also when beating Lucy Gray's ex, he pauses when the ex seems unable to respond, then decides to keep going and hitting him harder and harder, and before Sejanus drags him away you can see Lucy Gray looking pretty horrified in the background. I definitely saw him as malicious and conniving through the first 2 acts. In addition to being self serving and a liar, he seems to relish in violence when he feels he can justify it or has an excuse to do so.

There's no way to edit on that recording device so by only playing part of the conversation to the jabberjay he has 1) edited out that Sejanus was entrusting him with his plan, and that he had previously encouraged Sejanus to rebel 2) made it seem like the jabberjay just happened to pick up the snippet of conversation rather than being planted, so that nobody would ever know that he betrayed his ""friend""",2023-12-24
My husband and I were hitting each other at that! Loved it.,2023-11-18
Was Cesar flickerman really that old in The hunger games though? The difference between the two stories is basically 65 years. He seemed younger than that in the movies but I don't know if the books mentioned an age.,2023-11-19
Thank you! Totally missed that. Love it.,2023-11-19
Ohhhh I missed that! I was so aghast at him making dinner reservations as the tributes were being killed.,2023-12-06
Tuberculosis on legs,2023-11-25
Perhaps my favorite part of the movie.,2023-11-18
"In the German dub he said something along the lines of „wouldn’t it be funny now, if it turned out to be something really cute?!“ 
„Hm, not so cute“

Found that really funny, too",2023-12-17
Give him his own movie,2023-11-17
Instead of DVD commentaries - I would love a Flickerman style commentary of the Hungar Games,2023-11-17
"His commentary when the snakes came down was everything.

I wonder if it's Candy",2023-11-18
"In the book he actually really sucked at being a host and didn't know what to say half the time, so I'd say it's intentional.",2023-12-13
"I was actually really glad that they streamlined the 3rd act, because I thought it dragged in the book.  At least until the last few chapters.",2023-11-18
"Eh, I would say he did actually care about his family, and did care about Sejanus. His family came before everything though. If there was any obstacle, he would act to remove it, whether it be friends or lovers. That's not to say that he didn't become self-involved afterwards, but in this story, he was definitely pursuing wealth and prestige for his family.

Of course, he let his newfound status bring him further and further to deeper levels of depravity over the next 64 years. But I do believe he had a conscience at this point, but was using Lucy as a crutch, as his last grasp at morality. Without Lucy, he became a complete sociopath. It's much like the path of Anakin becoming Darth Vader. He didn't start out evil, but it was a long journey towards that path.",2023-11-18
"I felt the same way in the book.  And I think the adults in the book (Gaul, Highbottom) can see that sociopathy in Snow, even before he becomes completely evil.  Highbottom wants to stop him before he can hurt people, and Gaul wants to nurture it and bring it to fruition.",2023-11-18
"In the book you hear his thoughts and they are selfish and demeaning twards others throughout.  Even at the beginning, his grandmother gives him a rose, he pricks his finger and then talks about how he has to control himself to not freak out at his grandmother and Tigress has to talk him down.  He even thinks less of Tigress when she tells him what she's had to do on occasion in order to keep him fed.

He's livid after Lucy sings the song at the interviews because it's about another guy.",2023-11-18
"Why are you so convinced he’s a sociopath? I don’t think he is and I don’t think that would be a very interesting characterization either. He’s a conflicted person who cares a lot about the people close to him but also cares a lot about power and is taught to believe in fascist thinking, which he believes is the right way to govern the world. 

His character is interesting because he’s believable.",2023-11-20
">Showing empathy or other emotions when no one was watching or when it didn't benefit him is a clear flaw in the story. 

but sociopathy/psyche in general isnt that black and white, is it? i think that sociopaths still prolly can feel some empathy, its not like having 0 of it is mandatory to being socio... or is it?",2023-11-19
"See everyone's jumping that he's a sociopath but like he very much isn't one. Not everybody out there is a sociopath Hitler wasn't a sociopath. Putin isn't a sociopath. Just because you're trained or group you were raised with a different like outlook on life doesn't necessarily make you a sociopath you still have emotions these people still had emotions. 

What happens is you basically are just developing your own survival instincts. That's all this is he has emotions in the original story you just never get to see them from this point of view because you only see that hard exterior. But the personal attention he paid to katniss after that first hunger games that is from a place of emotion not from a place of being a sociopath.

Emotions can trigger very specific reactions in people. But he didn't really do a 180 the entire movie he was throwing people under the bus to survive. If anything I feel like that mess of circumstances brought him to that point of just having apathy if you lose everything you've ever loved why do you care about anyone else at that point why would you go out of your way to help people when you've already lost everything in your eyes. That's not being a sociopath.",2023-11-19
"that's the thing for me that i don't get reading these comments. As a non-book reader, i dont get the vibe AT ALL that Snow was a sociopath. To me, all of his actions (except prolly killing the dean) were acts that he had to do to survive. The movie showed how conflicted he was committing these acts and how guilty he felt after that.",2023-11-26
This is a perfect way to describe it. His private tears over Sejanus didn't make sense looking at the rest of his actions.,2023-11-17
"Everybody is so pressed to label him a sociopath and don’t realize that experiences and choices can take ANYONE down a dark path till they’re capable of great evil. I can’t speak for the book but that was the entire point of the movie, and it was plainly stated in the closing dialogue.",2023-12-17
">He was always a sociopath that cared only about himself (and how people viewed him).

They made that clear when he immediately disowned his pal at the start when speaking to the other students.

All his friendships are purely ones of convenience.",2023-11-22
This is exactly how I saw it too.,2023-11-20
The original cut was about 3 hrs 40 mins so maybe if we all complain loudly and long enough Lionsgate will do it,2023-11-23
"I agree, and this one (i will say idk where you could possibly split this movie fairly) should've been split, just so we can understand Snow's actions better. The film is truly moving at breakneck pace, and I was exhausted after the hunger games ended.",2023-11-22
I liked that it was two parts. I don’t know why people now watching on streaming would disagree either.,2023-12-20
[deleted],2023-11-18
"There was a much, much stronger case for splitting Mockingjay into two than there was for this movie. That book was an action-packed finale with a lot of stuff outside Katniss’s POV to expand on; this book is a low-key one-off character study with fairly relaxed pacing, not building to any particular big climax. 

I know in my bones that if they did split Ballad in two this sub would’ve hated it and complained it wasn’t necessary.",2023-11-18
I'd argue that one did require 2 parts because the book itself has totally different tones to it. The first half is a political drama while the second half is an action movie.,2023-11-26
If you go back to the mockingjay part 2 post it’s there !,2023-11-26
Exactly I completely disagree with these takes. Snow was also breaking the rules sneaking to hang with the rebels but scolded Sejanus when he was actually trying to help the people. If Snow wasn’t just being selfish he could have just told him he was on his own if he gets caught. Instead he secretly recorded him and gave him up.,2023-12-24
When flickerman said to Lucy “how wonderful that we get to watch your final performance” the whole theater let out a sad aww,2023-11-24
"Good point! I have to say, I found it very difficult to villainies him as much as i did with the book, especially with the way he cries after sejanus is killed. It’s like they weren’t even trying that hard to make us hate him haha",2023-11-24
">In this case, Snow was a complex character. He felt love for the girl, and he also felt love towards Tigris and his family’s honor and image, and he had aspirations of his own

I think it's also quite clear that while he loves her, he does so in a very selfish way, and that love doesn't assuage his own biases and bigotries.

Look at the conversation where he talks about bringing her to the capitol with him. Snow seems genuinely confused and surprised at LG not wanting to do so, and not sharing his views of the capitol being the only civilised place.

Snow doesn't understand why he can't have it all, doesn't understand how a lowley district girl wouldn't jump at the chance to be capitol.",2023-11-18
I don’t think he’s a sociopath at all. He’s smart and somewhat manipulative but he has general moral quandaries and it takes him a while to become truly ruthless. It’s not a matter of him being born “bad” at all.,2023-11-18
Agree with your take. I felt so bad for snows cousin and grandma and how he had to fake being rich at the start and just trying to study so much just to win that plinth to make his family safe,2023-11-20
Wowww. Beautifully said my friend.,2023-11-25
Thank you for beautifully putting all my thoughts into words.,2023-12-17
"I just feel intense malice and hypocrisy from him all the way from the start, not a gradual descent in any pace.

The earliest pointer was the class scene when he said his classmates were wrong and Sejanus was right, ""we should treat the participants as human beings"", then proceeded to propose the sponsorship system. You want them to be viewed as human beings but then you objectify them right away (as betting targets). That is extremely twisted.",2023-12-13
Love this breakdown.,2023-12-25
"I didn’t read the book but my partner did. She despised snow at the end. I walked out of the theater not feeling sympathy for snow, but feeling like he did what he had to in order to survive. I had a feeling that if I read the book and had him as the unreliable narrator that would have been a very different feeling.",2023-11-17
I feel that was the compromise like they couldn’t follow or feel his descent if he was like that from the start . It sucks because it would be so nice if the traits were there but then people around him realize it and fear him later after being blinded by his charisma.,2023-11-17
Not having his inner monologue makes that harder.  In the books you read his thoughts which are deranged and entitled from the start and have him justify all his actions and his feelings of superiority twards almost everyone in his life..,2023-11-18
I haven’t read the book but it was pretty clear to me as the movie progressed that he’s a sociopath. It was actually really wild watching him unravel and like being disappointed every time I thought I was rooting for him,2023-11-18
"I haven't read the book yet, but my thought on exiting the theater was that it took George Lucas 3 movies to do what this one did and not even half as well. I still felt the bond between him and Serjanus as a genuine friendship. While I think the trivia about how Mom is interesting, I feel the point was made well enough without it. But I'm definitely looking forward to reading the book now!",2023-11-19
"I don't think it's that he's a sociopath; it's what he says at the end, that the Hunger Games are to remind us all who we really are, and that the world is just a big Arena.

When he went in to save Sejanus and ended up getting attacked, then having to kill, it basically instilled a permanent survival mode that he didn't have before (or rather, not to the point of actually killing someone). I see it more like a latent PTSD, which Lucy Gray also has (""I still have one foot in the Arena""). They're both survivors now, and not like in the romanticized sense, but more like a state of brokenness.

So, take that state and put it in a guy with ambition and privilege and proximity to power like Snow, and you get a tyrant.",2023-11-28
">how hypocritical his thoughts are and how he will in the same breath criticize someone and then do the same exact thing (but of course for him it’s okay).

Maybe because he's not one...",2023-11-18
There's a moment when he spits something at one of the mentor's neck. It was hilarious af 😂,2023-11-26
"I felt like Lucky had more genuine moments that were more endearing, like he was just a regular weather guy who had to comment on the games.

You could make a limited TV series, but you'd lose a lot of the audience.",2023-11-18

"As someone who has read the book several times, I actually thought the changes they made for the film made it better.  They didn't make any massive changes but they streamlined things a bit.

"This isn't really this specific movie's fault, it's a very annoying very common film trope, but I hate when people get poisoned and die immediately. It would probably take a few minutes or maybe even hours to weeks depending on what the poison is. I understand why that wouldn't translate well to film but it always breaks my suspension of disbelief.",2023-12-24
"There's a lot we don't know about the character, but I wouldn't call him one-note. It was obvious that he low-key struggled with his part in the games. When he's introduced he's getting high on something to cope. 

Then he has this Snape-like arc where he clearly hates Snow because of his father, and the audience is left to wonder what happened to make him feel this way, which I thought Dinklage played really well. Is he just petty and spiteful or is he a rebel who hates what Coryo represents?

The ultimate reveal was rushed, but there a lot of interesting little hints in there as to what kind of person he is.",2024-01-28

"Which would have been when she was a very young child, so the accent would've stuck.",2023-11-18
That was definitely *NOT* an Appalachian accent,2023-11-19
I think it’s to make it clear that she’s “other” - in the book it’s discussed that the Covey are traveling musicians from the Appalachian region who were accidentally wrangled in to district 12 during the war and have been unable to escape.,2023-11-19
So she actually isn't from the Appalachia region which is where district 12 is. She's a traveling basically some sort of gypsy that was stuck for 10 years after the war because they locked down all the borders between districts when they started the hunger games. So her origins are accent could be from when she was a kid and her family.,2023-11-19
It also went in and out a lot. I don't know if it was Gray manipulating other characters or if it was just a continuity error.,2023-11-18

her theatre kid mannerism stood out too much at times. i get on stage you have to exaggerate your movements but on camera it's too much,2023-11-25

"I wasn't a fan either. Our first introduction of her was so theatrical, but now knowing the book context that she's an entertainer always pulled to the forefront makes it a bit more palatable. But I still don't like how tonally dissonant it felt from the world overall. 

Same for the scenes in the third part of the movie, when Coryo is in a white shirt and they're all heading to the lake. It looked like something off of an instagram reel, lool.",2023-11-19
Same. It like such a character being played up from the very beginning. Even her facial expressions while singing that song on tv while snow was getting up from the hospital bed..it just made me cringe so bad.,2023-11-18
"Yeah, very one dimensional character with no depth or development.",2023-11-24

Hated how open ended her part was In the third act though.",2023-12-06
I muted it every time she’d start singing. It was pretty unbearable.,2023-12-21
Did you have a personal dislike of Zegler before you saw the movie?,2023-11-22
The actual singing was good but the fact that she was singing in some of the situations she did was so so cringe I can't believe people liked it,2024-01-08
I was cringing for much of her on-screen time so you're not alone. The accent just didn't look or feel right nor did the singing.,2024-01-16
exactly !! im from the South as well but her accent was jarring to me bc she didn’t fit it at all nor was she consistent w the accent throughout the movie,2023-12-06
She said she came from a traveling family. So possibly from the Deep South.,2023-11-19

Pretty sure like the rest of the capital population their names come directly from ancient Rome,2024-02-26
Is this sarcasm. Because she technically is in this movie.,2023-11-19
"Yeah but I did he actually try to kill katniss though. Like from katniss's perspective which the entire series is biased from it really feels like he's coming down hard on her. But if you look at every other person who's truly wronged him he just went out and killed he went out of his way to try and direct her and focus her to do his bidding. And as much as he wanted to keep her alive because she was so famous in the capital he could have easily orchestrated some kind of accident that led to her death.

But the way he was so focused on her in the story definitely in my opinion to lose that there was something more emotional happening between him and katniss on his end then what actually we see from katniss's perspective. I think in some way snow saw not only Lucy gray within her but also himself within her.",2023-11-19
"Snow hates threats to himself and his dictatorship, and loves when he can use someone to prop up his own self worth and image. In Catching Fire he demands that Katniss performs conformity to Panem and love for Peeta so well that he himself believes it. She failed, and thus nothing he might elsewise find interesting or appealing with her matters; her death serves him better.",2023-12-04
"I also feel like the movie may have been better than the book, and I almost never say that.  I actually liked some of the changes they made.  Ending the games with the snakes and Lucy singing was AMAZING.  In the books, her win is kind of anti-climactic.",2023-11-18

"Absolutely not. Peeta in the books is described as blond, wavy haired, and blue eyed—but also stocky, muscular, and of medium height. In the movie, Snow is tall, rather lanky, and not stocky in the slightest, though he does have lean muscle.

I think there is an argument to be made that he was suicidal. Even if he wasn’t aware of it. He wanted to be punished and was disgusted by the callus life of luxury that surrounded him,2023-11-17
Let me blabber off about my conspiracy with the Rebels to my obviously Capital loyalist bestie who has made it clear he harbors no sympathy,2023-11-18
"Agreed. I didn't read the book, but that Sejanus was openly asking for a trouble the whole running time. He's a good person, I see it, but the way he fights for justice was downright naiive and stupid. I felt that Snow could have avoided a lot of trouble if Sejanus had not been his friend. For example, if you just watch the movie, if Sejanus wasn't there, Snow would never have gotten involved with the mayor's daughter and her gang in the first place. Not to mention that poor tribute Snow killed during the game.",2023-11-18
"Agreed! I found book Sejanus to be insane because he was basically attempting ""suicide by Peacekeeper"" at every turn. It really did make me sympathize with Snow more because he was truly a menace that would sabotage himself and take others down with him sooner than later. 

They toned him down in the movie but even then I think that was more so due to the fact they had to cut it out, rather than them changing how his character behaves.",2023-12-09
"Exactly - he's too smart to be fooled or so naïve or so ineffective in his efforts.  

So... he joins the peacekeepers, to be near his bro Snow in District 12 of all places. Then, promptly gives money to rebels, which (oh no!) they used to buy guns not money (i had no idea!!)",2023-12-21
"I haven't seen the movie yet, but my interpretation of him from the book is less that he's a hypocrite, and more that he's trapped in a situation without any practical way of helping people. He is willing to put himself in harm's way (possibly without thinking about the consequences, possibly because of suicidal ideation) for things he believes in, but he is constantly berated and even punished for merely questioning the status quo. He wants to help his tribute within the confines of the Games by giving him food, but Marcus rejects him. He sneaks into the arena to give Marcus a bit of dignity in death, and is coaxed back out based on the lie that he'll be able to help improve things in the future if he survives; once he escapes, his act is completely erased and he's punished by being drafted and sent away. I don't know if this happens in the movie, but in the book he talks to Snow about possibly becoming a medic to improve things for Peacekeepers and District 12 residents, and is crushed when it seems that this is not a likely outcome.

People seem to be making a lot of his final moments. To put it in perspective, one of the major themes of the book and movie is the social contract saving us from the state of nature, perpetual war between everyone. The book begins with a quote from Hobbes, who viewed the right to fight for your life as the only right that the state can't take away from you; anyone can justifiably defend themselves. We tend to think it's brave when fictional characters are stoic in the face of death, but I think to Collins it's a sign that the social contract is irrevocably broken. Sejanus is just a child, isolated, depressed, and dealing with emotional trauma, but he's given up fighting back because at every turn doing so has only made things worse. He was never a rebel, just someone who wished things could change. I don't really think that we're meant to judge him so harshly for being afraid to die.",2023-11-17

In the 1st person book he is judging everyone around him and manipulating people and excusing his own actions constantly.

And yes, I love how the movie didn’t stop when the game was over— we got to see so much more in this movie which was truly fascinating.

"That just isn't true at all. And that word gets thrown around like confetti by people on the internet.

Snow feels fear, guilt, regret, compassion, moral disgust, doubt, affection, and what he would call ""love"" during the course of the story. He clearly cares for Lucy Gray, his grandmother and his cousin, and for various classmates that he genuinely considers friends. He genuinely worries for Clemensia after she's bitten by snakes, for instance.  He comes to regard the Covey with affection. Yes, he has some negative thoughts and feelings about these people as well, but that's quite normal.

His feelings about Sejanus are conflicted. His predominant feelings toward him are irritation and frustration, but there's some affection and even pity mixed in with that.

Snow's characterisation is wonderfully nuanced.",2023-11-17
"did he really ever turn tho? at every point where he could have stopped with a little bit of violence, he continued because he liked it and the power he felt",2023-11-19
"My partner had the same question so I just whipped out the book to reread it. As background, he didn’t find out he was moving to District 2 ten days beforehand like in the movie, there was very little time between that promotion and him joining her. When he agreed to join her, he thought he was stuck in 12 and on borrowed time because the murder weapons would be found eventually. 

Once he leaves he hates the outdoor, the bugs and the mud and the jabberjays. So he’s having a bad time and was just told he had an out. Then they get to the cabin, where he finds the gun. He realized if he destroys them, there’s nothing connecting him to the murders and he’d be truly free. Except Lucy Grey, who could snitch. But he loves her and she loves him, so she wouldn’t, right? Except well if he scorned her, maybe she would? And he starts thinking about how she’s a “cold blooded killer” and “not an [innocent] lamb”, which she proved in the arena. (Mind you, this is mere pages after he justified her killings and painted her as a good person). So he decides, no she’s too calculated a person. Then he realizes she’s been gone a while and goes to find her. Then realizes *she* ditched *him* because she figured out that the third person he killed was Sejanus (not his BS excuse of “his old self”). Then he sees the scarf, gets bit by the snake, and thinks she tried to poison him like when she threw the snake down Mayfield’s dress in the reaping. 

In essence though, he’s trying to justify this to himself. Because he’s a narcissist. He wants to leave 12 and is looking for an out and looking for an excuse to clear all the loose ends. Plus, he is an extremely paranoid man. Nothing he thinks makes sense. It could’ve just been a random snake, not a planned murder. It ends up not even being poisonous. But he thinks everyone and everything is out to get him. It’s his main trait: he judges people for things then does it himself but justifies it (typical narcissistic behavior). Killing is bad when Lucy did it in the arena but it’s necessary for him in that moment. That thought process is not supposed to make sense.",2023-11-17
He realized she knew the truth about him betraying sejanus and could ruin his life,2023-11-17
"I feel like him leaving her broke him. I think he already viewed love and friendship with the exception of his family as transactional as we saw with sejanus. So her leaving him felt like the most extreme betrayal possible. 

That said I haven’t read the book so if I’m off the mark I’m sorry",2023-11-17
He was only leaving because he was sure he was going to be hung for killing the Mayors daughter.  Two things happen when they're on their way out first Lucy Grey figuring out that he killed Sejenus and then him finding the guns which lead Lucy to become distrustful.  When she decides to get away it makes him crazy.,2023-11-18
Because his class interests never changed. I thought this was the theme of the movie. Class interests trump everything.,2023-11-18
"He was scared and afraid. She was going to jeopardize his life and his safety when you hit that point you don't know what you're going to do until you're there some people don't hold up to their ends of their belief systems.

He did like her he did love her that's why he didn't hunt after her that's why he just went home and left and forgot it all happening and if she betrayed him she betrayed him she was gone and out of his life.

He flipped out like that because she betrayed him because after everything he did for her she showed him that he literally meant nothing to her. That's a correct analysis from his perspective. And the kind of person he is once she left and he kind of realized that she was just going to run away and potentially go back he realized that at this point in time there's no going back to fix his family name there's no going back to to get make sure his cousin is going to be alive the girl who literally survived through hell with him. She was going to jeopardize it all and so he went after her at first he went out with after her to try and find her and reason with her and he brought his gun just in case he had to put this to an end.

But then whenever he was bit by the snake he understood what his decision must be in his eyes she has to die. There's no other way around it she's jeopardizing his safety she's trying to attack him. She had a knife. And in his head he's just killed his best friend he's stuck out here in the middle of nowhere the girl he thought he loved never loved him. She even tried to attack him.

To me that seems like a proper conclusion somebody in his position would make.",2023-11-19
It was like that in the book too though.,2023-11-17
"Much like in the original trilogy, the book is all from one person's POV (Snow's).  So we see everyone through his eyes, and they don't get developed.  In the original trilogy, everyone is seen through Katniss's eyes, so they aren't truly developed, either.",2023-11-18

"When they had the conversation by the lake this literally came up.
And she explained that the Capitol would never be her place.",2023-11-19
"Oh that stuff is easy to explain. **Snow never planned on betraying Lucy when he got to the cabin.** He states the reason for running away with her was due to the fact that the Peacemakers would eventually find the gun somewhere in the district and trace it back to him with DNA evidence. So, Snow goes into the cabin then finds the literal murder weapons which made him have to run from his desired life. Once Snow finds the guns, you can see him in real time realizing that there is no longer a reason to run away with Lucy. 

The reason Lucy told him to look there is because there were originally only fishing poles in there. In the movie she literally said when Snow found the gun that Billy must have known of this location and decided to stash the guns there. Billy and Lucy were a part of the coveys together before their break up as evidenced by one of the covey kids missing Billy when they went out with Snow and Lucy that one time, thus it makes sense for Billy to know this hidden location of the cabin as the best spot to hide weapons. The guns were put there recently probably on the night of the murder, there was no way for Lucy to know that the guns would be there literally the only person that knew was Billy.

Finally, Snow didn't betray Lucy (not at first at least), when he found the gun he happily said he could get rid of all the loose ends but then Lucy outright called herself a loose end. Snow is concerned but asks Lucy for reassurance that she wouldn't rat him out, Lucy responded yes to the question but then very suspiciously invents a reason to leave the cabin to get food. Snow knows the reasoning is bogus and points out numerous flaws in the lie but still allows Lucy to head out, showing that he hasn't planned on betrayal yet. Some time later Snow finds out Lucy isn't in the area anymore and goes out looking for her primarily due to the fact that she could actually be going to sell him out. At this point Snow still probably hasn't planned on killing Lucy if he finds her, however he finds the gift that he gave to Lucy on the floor only to get bitten by a snake under it. Snow realizes Lucy literally set up a trap to hurt him knowing he'd try and pick up the scarf then get bit so he then starts yelling **""Are you trying to kill me Lucy!""** repeatedly. This is when Snow starts showing signs of active hostility against her and starts to fire the gun he brought with him. Snow betrayed Lucy because he felt like he was the one betrayed, Lucy lied to him to run away and set up a trap designed to injure him. To Snow he got betrayed not the other way around that's why he attempts to kill her after.",2023-12-22
"That's a good point. I only posed that because it felt like certain emotional scenes didn't get the few more moments they needed to breath and resonate. Some more time would have helped, but the movie was already a bit long. But I definitely can see a series losing people too, especially since there's way less competition at the movie theaters right now, while a show is competing with all the other big streaming epic shows",2023-11-18
"Absolutely. So many times I’ll finish a miniseries/season of tv and ask myself, “why couldn’t they have just trimmed the fat and made it a movie?”",2023-11-25
"I don't know I feel like this could have really held people's attention because not only could you have done it from the perspective of snow but you also could have thrown in Lucy Gray's perspective as well as some of the other various tributes and really made like part one like three or four episodes part two one or two episodes and part three like one episode.

And then you really shown out the games and made it kind of more tense. Really they should make a TV show and try and get this guy and a bunch of other people that were in this movie to go in that show and do like through the years of The hunger games as they face all these different tributes and we kind of see the capital go from this 1960s 1950s era society to like what they are in the present day hunger games. But at the same time you could definitely add in some of the rebel side of things because that's a big proponent. We could see more on like district 13 as well as some of the other rebel groups acting within the capital and acting within the districts to kind of see how this war was built up over time.",2023-11-19
"Different perspectives I suppose. I've always loved her voice and I'm not on the hate train for her (not to say that you are). Plus that ending scene, she played the tension and determination to survive so well to me. Her ""I'm not made of sugar."" was exactly how I'd imagined it in the book. And her rebellious ferocity when singing to the capital was great.",2023-11-19

I like this analysis,2023-12-20
But he told her he was going to 2 for officer training and the next day she trusted him enough to meet him at the hanging tree and lead him to their secret hideaway.  It would have made more sense for her to agree to meet him and then ghost.,2023-11-19
"To add:

It seems to me that lucy’s intent was never to kill snow. She set it up in a way so that he would think she’s trying to kill him so he would not have to choose between her/the outdoor lifestyle, and his capital life/family/power. if he’s under the impression she wants him dead, he has no reason to stay. Essentially she gives him an easy way out because she did love him. This also gives her time to escape from him who is clearly unstable and no longer trustworthy. 

The snake under the scarf (assuming it wasn’t there by coincidence) is also a test to see how he would react. Had he been calmer instead of trying to shoot her, she may have considered staying or talking it out. 

I think most likely it was both, as even if snow failed her test, which he did, she wouldn’t resort to murder again like snow does so easily (snow is projecting his readiness to kill).",2023-11-21
"Kinda what I gathered as well from the movie.  Boy did the third act not feel fleshed out enough though.

I still think Snow wouldn't have harmed her.  After everything he went through for her, I didn't buy that he would harm her.  

Oh well.  Movie wasn't perfect but again I got the general idea lol.",2023-11-18
That's kinda what I gathered but it really wasn't fleshed out enough.  I felt the third act really lacked substance.  It didn't feel convincing to me as I still felt like Snow would've done anything for her.,2023-11-18

">since Mockingjay (alongside Harry Potter) was one of the BIG examples of a finale hurting itself by doing that

Did it though? I realize neither part of Mockingjay made as much as Catching Fire, but they combined to make a lot more than Catching Fire. If they would have done one long Mockingjay, the budget would have been a lot higher than either part and I think would have resulted in a lot less profit. They made a combined $1.4B WW on a combined $285M budget. That's a great return.

I'm also pretty sure that a lack of an actual hunger games in Mockingjay was just as big of an issue from a box office perspective as splitting the movie up.",2023-11-17
"*Was* Harry Potter a big example of a finale hurting itself? Because even with two movies, the book was so eventful that both had to cut a ton.

They should have filmed everything at the same time and have 2 parts released relatively close to each other. They could have ended part 1 in the middle of the games during a tense moment so people who haven't read the books have to come back to see who wins.

"This movie would've been better as a 2 parter, but the story doesn't lend itself to 2 parts, unfortunately. 3 acts can't split well, you'd have to stop halfway through the Games.

I agree with what you said, except this part. Not only would it be impossible for a modern day Lucy Gray to prove Snow did anything, it literally wouldn’t matter. Snow killed (or had others kill) plenty of people, openly and blatantly, in the hunger games series.

It probably would have felt less rushed if we got to see more of the other reapings, or other tribute interviews, although that wouldn't have added much to the story and there wasn't time for it.",2023-11-26
I read the book and I thought the third act made more sense in the movie than it did in the book.,2023-11-18

"I mean I feel like calling it filler isn’t really a fair reading. It’s the gradual escalation of rebellion within the world. As well as katniss coming to grips with being the symbol of the mockingjay. As well as showing the aftermath of catching fire and the impact on everyone 

If it was one movie I bet a million dollars the same people thinking this should have been a two parter would have similar complaints",2023-11-17

They don’t look alike either",2023-12-20
"It’s not really a legit question knowing the timeline, this was 60+ years in the past where Katniss isn’t even a thought yet. Also the fact that we see Katniss’s mom multiple times lol",2023-11-19
Hmm... really good point.,2023-11-19
Yep solid movie for sure and def good but still under the first two,2023-11-20
"To add onto the other commenter, they cut out Ma, which I think was a disservice. His interactions with Sejanus’s mother is something that very well captured how Snow was very charismatic and polite on the outside but internally, he looked down on everyone and had very toxic thoughts about those around him and zero respect.",2023-11-17
"Some of the tributes died before they entered the games (through the bombing, being shot in the zoo, etc), and they paraded their bodies around through the streets during the funerals of the deceased Capitol kids (a lot more died during the bombings) to set an example to the districts. One was hoisted on the back of a crane, and a few were draped behind horses.  


The tributes were treated like animals to the extent that they had a vet take care of their medical needs pre-games.

Reaper eventually got rabies as well, and him and Lucy Gray had a pretty long stand-off to finish the games. He wore the Capitol flag as a cape.",2023-11-17
"They included Snow’s classmate getting bitten by the snake, but cut the part where she started getting sick and growing scales.

There was a black market in the Capitol that was cut completely. 

Lucy Grey’s band mates were barely in the movie despite being very important in the book.

A lot of the actual mentoring was cut.",2023-11-17
"The reaping happened really fast.  They cut the damage that happened to Clemencia after she got bit by the scales.  They also cut the funerals for the capital kids who were killed in the bombing and in the zoo with the bodies of the tributes dragged behind.

Some Tigress stuff",2023-11-18
They cut out a few pages of the characters churning butter. I kid you not.,2023-11-25
"The main 2 things are Snow and Lucy Gray's extreme charisma before the games, and Ma. Snow is constantly showboating and helping his classmates. Him and Lucy before the games are always taking the cameras and playing it up hard, because there are a few extra interviews and interactions between them in the book. It builds up their romance a bit more. He's so good that he convinces the rabies guy's mentor to give up all her food after her tribute dies. And manages to get Lucy the guitar from a friend for her first interview. In the movie, he just seems to be some nobody at school, when he was always the most interesting person in the room. Just like his tribute. 

In the books, Sejanus is an even bigger pain in the ass, but Snow is outwardly friendly towards him so he's stuck comforting the family when he goes into the arena. This leads to being able to ask the mother, Ma, for sweets and favors that he uses to bribe people like Lucy Gray at the beginning and the peacekeepers at the end. It really sells his public friendship with Sejanus up until he betrays him, which impresses the Capitol. But really Snow despises him. 

I don't agree that Clemmy needed more screentime after the snakes thing, although the rainbow pus would've been cool to see. The movie is too long as it is.",2023-12-04
"I don't get it, why would Tigris hate him? She couldn't have known about Coriolanus killing people in 12",2023-11-20
"Something about the dress in the first movie makes me think. When it catches fire, it’s very similar to the colour patterns on Lucy’s. Cinna must have had some insight- either Plutarch whispered in his ear OR Snow did. I see the pattern of Snow letting other people take credit for his work. He plants the seed and watches it grow. 

Everything means something or none of it does.",2023-11-20
"> I really enjoyed reading your take on the central romance, as portrayed in the movie, and I think this is a good summary of the main themes and the opposing forces at work within the romance. 

Hey thanks a lot for the appreciation!

> I'm pleased that you were able to get this much from just the movie version (I'm assuming you haven't read the book); it shows that the film told its story successfully!

Yes, I have not read the book although after the movie I am keen to. And indeed the movie did its job well enough I feel.

> Slight quibble here. Sejanus was not really Snow's ""friend"", never mind a close one. Perhaps the movie didn't make that clear enough..? But I suppose he was from Lucy Gray's and other people's POV.

Yeah the movie did try to make it seem close. Snow risks his life to enter the arena and save Sejanus. They also seem to be bonding initially in their time in D12. But I guess you are right. A guy like Snow, he wouldn't have any close friends now.",2023-12-17

"Snow and Lucy were also a perfect duo on-camera in the books. They hammed it up every time they were on screen. Snow was supposed to be super charismatic and outwardly friendly towards everyone, like the most interesting person in any room, but he was just some guy in the movie. 

We didn't need an extra hour of runtime for his internal monolog, but they could've showed us him looking for cameras or an audience before doing anything good. The only reason he jumps in to try and help the girl who got stabbed at the zoo in the books is because he wants to be seen as the first person to help her on camera. I feel like we were robbed of a really fun performance. We shouldn't have needed Darth Vader music to tell you he was being evil. I figured the movie would've actually benefitted from being able to show instead of tell unlike the book.",2023-12-04
thank you!,2023-11-17
"Lucy Gray is literally a traveling performer. Rachel being over-the-top at times, like a broadway performer, makes sense, no?",2023-11-23
I read the books and considered Snow to be a sociopath/narcissist. He's been told how good the Snow family is all his life while dealing with running out of money (which isn't really touched upon in the movie).,2023-11-17
"I have not read the books. I guess I was more describing the Snow in the original series. I had more to say about this version of Snow but I didn't want to go on too long. Basically I was just expecting Snow's ""superpower"" to be like he is so good at not considering rebels people that he understands what the games are and how they should run better than anyone because he cuts out all emotion. This version of Snow was more trying to kill two birds (hah) with one stone. He was exploiting them because he thought it would help them and also help him, it's just a long way to go from falling in love with a tribute to spending the next 60 years killing them off. I thought he'd start closer to that kind of sociopath you can't disagree with because they're the smartest person in the room.",2023-11-17
"The people in these comments arguing that he was deciding, nah he was slippery the whole time.",2023-11-25
And he had many many opportunities to either run away from or stand up to the Capitol and all it stands for and every time he had to choose it or someone else he chose it.,2023-11-20
"Yes, sorry lol",2023-12-29
"Yep, I’m surprised people were so adamant it happened too fast. Snow was cold and calculating the whole film. The only conflicting part is that as the audience, seeing snows childhood context, makes us or at least made me somewhat sympathize with him trying to regain power in order to help his family who is on the brink of eviction.",2023-12-03
I see. I thought the dean was ready to die lol and kinda acknowledged how fucked up the games is and felt guilty about his contribution to it. Then snow came in and the dean sees how this guy just became so much more powerful. And he is gonna make the game even more despicable and there’s nothing that he can do about it so he committed suicide hahah. How wrong i was lol,2023-11-26
Ahhhh that all happened so quickly I think I mixed it up - thank you!,2023-12-10
Omg you’re so right I to was confused and forgot he didn’t kill the guy haha,2023-12-20
"Yea I believe I saw all 4 and read the original trilogy (although I did not read this new book.)

Maybe it’s just fond memories, but everything felt much more realistic and less just kinda obviously dumb in those. Jennifer Lawrence was a legit top tier actress and not someone really forcing an cartoon sounding accent.",2023-11-20
couldn’t have said it better myself.,2023-12-09
"Well yeah, but in the original trilogy, the hunger games themselves were incredibly entertaining, and you were still on the edge of your seat, wondering if *both* Katniss and Peeta would make it, and what it would take for them both to survive. Their whole will-they-won’t-they relationship added an interesting layer too. In TBOSS, personally, I didn’t feel the chemistry between the leads, and the opponents were so over-the-top & one-dimensional that I never had any doubt Lucy Gray would win. I get that the early hunger games were supposed to lack flair, but man, was it boring. And then, when they finished, and you looked at the time and realized there was still an hour or so to go, it felt kind of meaningless. I don’t know, it just didn’t hit the same. 

I didn’t downvote you by the way, dunno who did.",2023-11-19
"Yes Sejanus told Snow the plot but didn’t Snow literally come up to Sejanus and ask what he was doing before telling him to stop? Sejanus wasn’t even trying to involve Snow but Snow kept being nosy, trying to follow him and get information. If he wanted to stay out of it, he could have easily done so lol.",2023-11-18
"I get that. But who would know that Snow new about Senajus except for Snow himself? And the only reason Snow even knew anything is because he was going out of his way to be nosy and find out what Senajus was doing because Senajus was definitely trying to keep Snow out of it. It’s like Snow went looking for trouble, found it, got mad that he found it so his resolution was to get the “trouble” killed for existing? lol. Like Snow literally could’ve just minded his business.",2023-11-19
"Definitely a confusing character. I was also really confused by why Highbottom hated Snow so much. The ending reveal that Highbottom actually hated and wanted to stop the games and his resentment towards Snow because his father proposed the games felt so out of left field. It was like in Harry Potter, them trying to convince us that Snape was a good guy and trying to help all along lol",2023-11-18
Her singing with the stupid theatrical grin on her face to the cameras when she had the snakes all over her made me bust out aughing it was so cringe,2023-11-26
"I've seen comments calling it fantastic and I'm amazed at that tbh. It was cringe at times and the low camera angle they chose for many scenes was jarring.

Also they escaped into the hole, into another room but when Jessup got rabid they literally just walked up and out of the hole???",2023-12-28
"The movie was going to have songs in it, it's literally in the title ""Ballad"". Also, she didn't sing as much as she did in the book, they took a lot of songs out.",2023-11-18
"Ok that’s the title but she get slapped by capital guards, goes “just a minute boys” and then breaks out into song. 

Makes zero sense. Why would a capital guard use unnecessary force to keep someone in line and then let them sing a song? 

The lucy actor was probably given singing time in her contract or something.",2023-12-02
That doesn't mean that >!I enjoyed her singing.!< They should've gone with someone else.,2023-11-29
"Yeah I think you’re right and I was mistaken, I just thought for some reason that they had mentioned sponsorships being a thing in previous games",2023-12-19
"Interesting, I like your take on that. Maybe after Snow killed the mayor’s daughter is when she started losing feelings and thought of a way to escape after. 

Also the entire movie seems like her actions like her singing felt more rehearsed (might be why years later the games are more performance based & being likeable) as if she had already planned for it.",2023-12-24
I enjoyed him. I was just shocked NO one was laughing in my theater 🥺,2023-11-18
Her accent didn't sound like that either than. It sounds like a high school drama kid impersonating someone from the south east,2023-12-04
"I dont have an issue with him I just think he is not fit for this specific role. The writers also did him wrong. In the book there is so much more depth to him but in the movie he sounds and act like a simple decent guy. 

Peter Dinklage owned it though.",2023-11-20
"Yes, but the dialogue, pacing, acting from the leads, the trying to humanise a villan becuase he was betrayed by his lover... made the whole thing absolutely boring and the plot never even helped us grasp why he was a villan either. It felt like a waste of time.",2023-11-20
Wasn’t his voice in the recording which the whole town including Lucy heard?,2023-11-21
"Rachel Zegler played that scene very emotional and Lucy Gray in the books just silently figured out what the 3rd person is, so it wouldn't provoke Coryo. For me, that part of the scene was yelling lol

As for Dr. Gaul I should've specified that she was portrayed as a psycho doing random psycho things because she was angry, f.e. scene where she realeses the snakes. In the books she was mysterious, but never lost her cool like in the movies and always had hidden purpouse of doing certain things.",2023-12-09
…she turns into a snake?!,2023-12-20
"Ah, many thanks!",2023-11-20
"Okay, that makes more sense, thanks for the clarification.

"There's another scene that confused me, when that guy was hanging on a rock by his arms and rope and the girl mercy killed him with a knife slamming his neck im like wtf did she miss or intentionally not kill him?

PG-13= no blood.,2023-11-18
Ah yes we cannot downplay the severity of fictional events,2023-11-19
Very curious about the insistence on blood from dead children. It takes little to nothing away from the plot.,2023-11-24
"I was too busy wincing from every mutilation to notice the lack of blood, so I really don't think not having it makes it any more suitable for...",2024-01-14
"Yeah, that's why I said ""not much of it.""  People are acting like the first movies were really bloody and they weren't.  There was a little but it's not like blood was gushing out of every wound like it would have been in real life.",2023-11-29

I've seen it and I liked it!,2023-11-22
"In the book she hides the whole time, probably scared and having no idea what’s going on :/",2023-11-27

LOL great point. “And let’s not forget my second flower: buttercup. It reminds me of a cat in many ways..” 🥴,2024-01-07
I think she just simply withheld the information until it could be used to gain.,2023-11-22
I had a similar feeling. Either he was dead the whole time and she delayed news to fit her agenda better or she straight up pulled the plug to fulfill her narrative when needed.,2023-11-25
But the game maker of the first movie is killed by the president?,2023-11-25
"This is the arena for the first ten games. There was no gimmick. They literally just threw 24 kids into the middle and made them fight it out gladiator style.  Lucy Gray even points out there is nowhere to hide and Snow counters that the explosions have opened up the walls and tunnels to contestants for the first time.  Before 10, the games got boring for the capital and were largely ignored in the districts after the reaping.  The gamemakers recognize this which is why they got the older students to be mentors/a focus group.  What would reignite interest in the games?",2023-11-17
This is so true. I can actually hear snow's thought process when serjanus bought his way to be assigned in the 12.,2023-11-17

In the book Spruce was already dead by the time of the execution. But both Sejanus and Lil are both screaming. I thought it was interesting to have Sejanus be the only one visibly upset.,2023-11-23
Can't stop calling him Vaganus.,2023-11-25

"Now that you mention it, putting that in the movie would have given more context to why they sponsored his tuition to the University at the end. I was under the initial impression that they were blackmailed to sponsor Snow because they just didn't seem to build the relationship between him and his parents for the audience. All we saw of Sejanus' parents was them silently thanking Snow for saving him in the arena.",2023-11-19

He definitely wasn’t playing at activism - he was ready to be a martyr for the cause at every turn and was a key player in trying to break the rebel out of jail before he was discovered. Maybe the movie didn’t portray it as well but in the books he was born and raised in district two before his dad fell into a shit ton of money during the war and moved them to the capitol.,2023-11-19
"> He despite his good intentions he was “Play activism” when it got real he was inconsolable till the very end crying out for his mother.

Are we really gonna say that someone who died for his actions was a ""play activist"" just because he was terrified of death?",2024-01-07
"I think everyone would react differently. You never know until it's you. Could say we wouldn't react the way he did, but until the noose is around our neck, there's no way to know for sure. At least Sejanus had a conscience.",2023-12-12
"It isn't that ""play activism"". Lots of people are scared yet still do good and risk their lives. The screaming really shows the cruelness of their society than a reflection on himself. From the movie he is portrayed as a regular person and not some elite who was taught to be scheming. So he never directly utilized his family's power effectively and probably wouldn't be able to anyways.",2023-12-21

Doesn’t she have a line in Mockingjay where she mentions that Snow forced the surgeries onto her?,2023-12-11
💀,2023-12-08
"Yup it’s to show that you never know if Snow would’ve actually killed Lucy. The point was SHE thought he would. Maybe not that day. Maybe not tomorrow.

But she was a loose end that he could turn on at any point and she knew it. She also knew that by staying with him, she was entirely dependent on him not deciding to eliminate the loose end so in her mind she was safer by just running - presumably north as they were headed.

The book and movie purposely leave it open if she survived. It’s assumed she’s dead by the time Katniss comes around for the 74th Games or is in such deep hiding that she never is coming back.

But it worked perfectly because Snow was about control. Having control over others so they can’t betray you like most had done to him. He couldn’t control Lucy and she realized he’d try long before he realized she’d leave because of it.

So in the end, it’s the thing he loved the most that destroyed him.",2023-11-18
"I think you have a really good point. I definitely saw that as well. However, I saw Lucy being authentic and true to herself. In the movie, she mentions that nothing is more important to her than trust.. not even love. This sort of foreshadows everything that Snow is about to do and ultimately betraying her trust. She brings up living a peaceful life together with Snow. However , Snow was hesitant and stated that he will always belong with the Capitol. 

Once Snow mentioned “killing three people”, Lucy immediately questioned him. He played it off, and im sure she saw right through him. Again, she trust is above all else for her and it’s obvious there’s no trust between the two of them",2023-11-18
"I feel like both the book and movie didn't do a good enough job showing that everything Snow had ever done had been for himself. Lucy Gray realized that and left because she knew Snow murdering her would have been the best thing for him.

I think small differences in the movie could have made a big difference. For example, after all the tributes had been killed by the snakes, Snow immediately declaring himself the winning and cheering for himself would have much better highlighted his sociopathy and that he only cared about himself. I feel like it was also a mistake to show him feeling remorse over the getting Senjanus Plinth executed. Sociopaths can fake empathy or love, but as soon as it's not beneficial for them anymore, they would stop faking it. Two relatively small changes that I think would have dramatically changed how viewers perceived Snow.",2023-11-17
"I don’t think Lucy was simply “catering” to snow as she seemed genuinely happy when she first saw him in district twelve. I just think her attraction to him was almost a mix of Stockholm syndrome and suspension bridge effect. She was under a *lot* of stress during the hunger games, and he ended up being a source of support for her despite him being a capital citizen. Of course I agree that she was probably just trying to use him as much as he was using her in the beginning, but that definitely changed by the end. I think the feelings she developed for him *were* real, and vice versa, just that as she finally was able to return to her normal life and calm down she began to see the red flags that hadn’t been obvious before. His duplicity and quickness to resort to violence was useful and even endearing to her when she was in a constant state of “fight for my life”, but it eventually became clear that this wasn’t just a product of the situation they were in but who he was.

But otherwise I think you’re spot on.",2023-11-25
"I love that the snake was under the scarf, like a trap that had been laid all along. Also, I read it, but I could be wrong in saying that he didn't actually imagine shooting her in the book. I truly believe if she'd stayed with him, he'd get tired of her quirks and get rid of her.",2023-11-19
She was a romantic. He wasn't. He was about the job and glory. She was right to run as it wasn't looking to be good. With the two game makers looking to make their own moves their relationship was pretty much doomed.,2023-11-22
"The book is even more ambiguous about whether Lucy set the snake as a trap or not. By that point in the book, Coriolanus realizes that Lucy Grey is the only thing still linking him to the murders, and he begins to convince himself of how harmful/deadly she really is as a way to justify killing her. He tells himself that she killed people in the arena and that she has been an evil killer this whole time. He interprets the snake as a trap that she deliberately set for him. But when he goes into town to get the snake bite treated, he’s told that snakes tend to come out after it rains, possibly suggesting that the snake was really just a coincidence and that Coriolanus might have been paranoid.",2023-11-28
"As someone who just read the book yesterday, and watched the movie today, you're missing a key point she discusses earlier. Trust is key. Trust is more important to her than love.

He has done questionable things, but he's a good person, in her eyes. She can trust him, because those things were out of desperation and out of love. However, he lies to her, she sees right through it, and it's not a stupid lie. She figures out the only person he could have possibly killed was Sejanus. His best friend, his brother. And lied to her about it, breaking her trust.

So now she starts seeing him for what he is, and she's pretty guarded. She still loves him (the snake not being venomous could go either love, or that she's not really a killer at heart), but she can't trust him. And as she says, if she can't trust someone, she'll dissappear from their life, as if they were dead.",2023-11-22
"A detail I liked was when he meets her for the first time alone in 12, and goes to kiss her, she hesitates again and he says ""you're safe with me"" but his hands are literally around her throat. She definitely used and feared him the whole time, even if there was feeling.

And so what if there was, I don't blame her for being attached to the only support she had during a horrible time. But she was too smart to be all in.",2023-11-27
"I haven't read the books either, so thank you for that explanation. But I had another question, why the sudden change in the first place? Like that response by Lucy ""Except me"" when Snow said there are no loose ends was so passive aggressive and accusatory. If she didn't make that comment there would be no tension afterwards, no? So why the sudden change in her character?",2023-11-17
"This is the only thing I don't like about the scene in the movie- that he decides against it. 

In the book it was pretty clear to me that he had made up his mind to kill her basically from the moment he saw the guns. He lies to himself internally because he's a narcissist and needs to justify his actions but everything he does supports that he was going to kill her. It shows that he never loved her and everything he has ever done has ultimately been for himself.

I love this because it shows how good narcissists are at deceiving themselves and others that they are a good person, but in the end they will do what is best for them and them only. Despite our better judgment as readers we rooted for Coriolanus and the book flips that on its head at the end and shows how you were deceived, reminding you that this is the same man Katniss fought in the OG trilogy.",2023-11-29
"Ah that also connects to when she asks who the third person he killed was and Snow says his old self, and then we see her reaction to that.

Even if she really did love him he is no longer the same and she realizes what he has become - he has become mad. 

This may be grasping at straws but when he asks his cousin (I dont know her name Ive never really watched the series) she says he looks just like his father. Earlier in the movie she says his father always had hate in his eyes. If she is saying he looks like his father the new hatred in his eyes is probably what caused that.",2023-12-10
But if she never loved him why tell him shes running away and wait for him to join her? Why not just run away to the cabin and never show him it,2023-11-19
I'm a little confused why Snow would kill the mayor's daughter if he was gonna rat on Sejanus anyway.,2023-11-19
"Also, she probably put it together earlier when she asked him who the third person he killed was that he had sold out his friend. That was probably already changing her opinion of him, and she slowly realized more and more that he might be dangerous, culminating in the scene in the cabin, where she tested him a little bit and saw in his eyes that there was a chance he might kill her to serve his own interests.

Personally, I didn’t feel like Snow could have actually gone through with killing her at that point. They could have made him a *little* more ruthless to make it feel like he might actually do it. But I think that’s what they were going for.",2023-12-15

Also, why is she still there in the woods if she decided to run off? After she left, he had time to drop of the weapons and she didn't get further? What is that saying? Was she really 100% sure in her decision if she stayed that close by? 


Or maybe the snakebite made him crazy and Lucy wasn't even there when he shoot, but this still confuses me like hell.",2024-03-06

"This is pretty much how my wife saw this part of the movie (she had to explain it to me, lol)",2023-11-20
"Why would he kill her?  Why would he be so concerned about being found out? (Werent there 2 other witnesses to his shooting the mayors daughter?)  

He's risked everything to escape the base and flee north with her. Couldnt he have killed her at any time before that (if he actually is evil, contrary to all evidence?)   He was escaping with her; why did he care who knows what he did/didnt do since he was now outside of Panem's grasp, no?  

I thought that _she_ planted the guns there, but couldnt figure out why.

[Also: I didnt understand why he purposely betrayed his friend with the recorded mockingjay. That recording was just for the mockingjay rit? Presumably he threw away the recorder bc it wasnt useful after he'd ""programmed"" the mockingjay? So.. WHY did he betray his best friend? That was the only way to stop him?  WHy didnt he _kill_ his friend if he's a sociopath-- why kill him so circuitously by planting that evidence? So, he was ""Bad"" even back then??]",2023-12-21
"As someone who never read the book. I got the opposite effect watching it. 

I felt like Snow was the one who pulled away during that first time they were going to kiss. Also, I never thought he wanted to kill her at all in the cabin. He came off as more surprised of "" why would you even think something like that, I love you, never even crossed his mind ""

He then goes to fish and the woman he loves, leaves his mom's special item, and has a snake under it to bite him.

So to me, as someone who never read the book, it came off as she was the one in the wrong ( in terms of the relationship between them ) and I understood why he felt betrayed. He was about to give up everything for her. 

Again, the book might have touched on this and made more sense, but I never read it. Just how it comes off as someone watching the movie. 

Also, why would she be worried he killed his best friend? I didn't sense anything in the movie to make her remotely think about that scenario

And given that the arena appear to just be ""Thunderdome, But Bigger"" it makes sense.

">You can care for other people (or think you do), yet still rationalize selfish behavior that hurts those same people.

Aren't most people guilty of that, though, to varying degrees?

I guess I'm just really over the trend of armchair diagnosing loads of people/characters with sociopathy/psychopathy on the internet.

""Unadulterated"" means complete and pure, so Snow being an ""unadulterated sociopath"" would suggest that he has *no* capacity for empathy or love, and is the worst kind of sociopath who could exist, which just isn't true.

It's pretty clear to me that the story Suzanne Collins was telling was how Snow's traumatic experiences/circumstances at a formative age, alongside some poor *choices,* shaped him to become who he was. Yes, his innate traits play a part, but things *could* have turned out differently for him - especially if he wasn't essentially a piece in Dr Gaul's games.",2023-11-18

I think this is more obvious in the book, especially because I think in it it's clear he was 100% going to kill Lucy Gray after he found the guns, unlike in the movie where it appears he considers it but ultimately rejects the idea until the snake trap.

In the book he went with her because he thought he had no other choice but as soon as he finds the guns and realizes all he has to do is kill her and he can get what he always wanted, he turns on her.",2023-11-29

"Yeah, these too. I love how the movie, while a fictional story, seems to draw so many parallels with real life difference in cultures and social classes, and it does so without being too preachy or on the nose.

For example, one could be from the Middle East and the other is born in or immigrated to a western country, and they fall in love, and one of them acts as if him/her being the one in the western country means the other person has to be all over them, because they have the “best standard of living” that the other person “must aspire to”, and should be “grateful” for. 

I also love how Snow began to not only genuinely love her, but he was also questioning the idea that she’d have real feelings for him, when he asked “is this real?”, and it makes sense, he’s a mentor who’s making her popular, why wouldn’t she pretend to care for him? But then she saved his life and he loved her more, but eventually he’s at this crossroads where he’s stuck between “she has to love me because I’m the best option she’ll ever get and I have to be her hero and savior” without considering the possibility that she might not want what he has to offer vs. “well yeah maybe she loves me and I love her genuinely, but how will I reconcile my love life with my standards of living and life goals?”

I just love this movie!",2023-11-18
">Look at the conversation where he talks about bringing her to the capitol with him. Snow seems genuinely confused and surprised at LG not wanting to do so, and not sharing his views of the capitol being the only civilised place.

I didn't understand in that way. If we think about it, he grew up in the Capitol and consumed a lot of propaganda about how the Capitol was the peak of civilization while the districts were a bunch of savages. He doesn't really understood why someone would choose to live in a poor, grey place while they have the choice to live in somewhere better",2023-12-15

"Yeah, exactly! I’m surprised how many people immediately attach that label to any villain. Just because someone is a villain, doesn’t mean they’re the way they are because of mental illness. Some people just have terrible moral codes to live by. They still have empathy and love for those they deem “their own”, but that doesn’t justify it.

They aren’t incapable of feeling emotion and empathy, they’re just selective of whom to give it to, because their own selfish interests or moral code/dogma is above all.",2023-11-18

"That’s because it wasn’t just descent from going into the games or falling in love and being heartbroken from Lucy Gray, but rather the ingrained teachings of being in the Capitol. He was born and raised there, his parents both died in the Dark Days, a rebellion of the districts which Capitol propaganda knew damn well how to brainwash everyone to see as evil.

His family’s wealth and power all went away because of that and he grew up trying to earn any opportunity to take that power and wealth back. Of course he isn’t gonna look at the districts with respect. He views them as instruments for his success.",2023-12-13

"Yeah, I haven't read the book yet (I have a big backlog of novels to go through), but the movie was great. If a narrative can you make you feel empathy for the villain, then it did something right, as not everything is black and white. Snow betrayed everybody in order to provide support for his family. If he didn't betray Sejanus, he would've been hanged just the same. 

Sejanus's wealth and status didn't prevent his demise, so what chance did Snow have, just being associated with him? As much as Snow might like some parts of District 12, the Capitol is the only home he's really ever known. Allowing a rebellion against his home would be betraying his family, which was a line he just could not cross. It's possible that, had Snow spent the entire 20 years in District 12, he might've found humility and care for the people in all the districts. But he chose to isolate himself within the Capitol, away from the peasants.",2023-11-18

"I also like the difference between he and Caesar - who is presumably his son based on the dinner reservation with a high chair Easter egg.

Caesar has a huge personality and while very vain about his appearance, does seem to actually want to help the tributes get sponsors unlike Lucky who sees the participants as lesser humans who can be discarded for the Capitol’s entertainment.

By the 74th Games when Katniss and Peeta won, the Games were more about a spectacle than punishment. Spending all that money on banquets, parties, stylists, etc was the evolution of the Games from punishment for rebellion to “a pageant of honor and sacrifice”.

If you only knew that growing up and weren’t alive during the Dark Days, you’d never know that the Games used to be dump 24 district kids in a zoo until it was time to fight then throw them in an arena with no food source and tell them to make it quick. Now it’s a huge event that engulfs Capitol for weeks so you need a big personality host to run it - hence Caesar.

But Lucky doesn’t even see the tributes as people whereas Caesar takes his time and asks them questions to show their best selves so they can get help in the arena. When Rue says not to count her out, Caesar responds in a caring and genuine tone he “wouldn’t in a million years”.

And with her being this face of the rebel army he has to do something in order to stop her but instead of just outright trying to kill her he decides to try and manipulate her into seeing the way that and things that he saw and by leveraging the people around her to try and get her to not be a Rebel.

But if you was truly a sociopath and he was truly cutthroat and he didn't have any feelings for her and didn't have any kind of empathy towards her situation I feel like he would have just went out and killed her family or did something to her that would truly point the message that she needs to stop in line in order for people not to go into unrest or just take her out of the picture and bury her under the next year's tributes.

Yeah she could have been a martyr but there's smart ways to do this to where she wouldn't be a martyr. and snow seems like a very cunning person so my only conclusion is that he felt some sort of empathy for her and her situation and she reminded him of people he's known in his past and he took it easy on her instead of doing it the easier way.

Ah didn’t even notice that - amazing!,2023-11-25
"I expected there to be songs, but not sooo many damn songs going on for so long. And weirdly, despite the fact that Rachel Zegler is such a good singer, I preferred Jennifer Lawrence's singing over hers. Because when Katniss did it, it felt real and emotional, rather than theatrical and overwrought. 

By the third Lucy Gray performance I was like 'okay, y'all are clearly trying to sell a soundtrack here and I'm not buying it'.",2024-01-28
Agree. The line between him trying to get out/rebel vs couldn't live with himself was very thin.,2023-11-17
"I do not think that after going in to honor Marcus’s body that he cared about getting out alive. He had no friends at all being from district 2, Snow was his “friend” but that was mostly one sided…",2023-11-17
"He acted suicidal multiple times, starting with going into the Arena.  He did that because he wanted to die.  Then he didn't care about being careful in 12 because he didn't care if he did die, he wanted to leave but he would rather be dead than staying in his position.",2023-11-18
"Yeah even if his intentions were good, he was way too reckless and even inconsiderate of how his actions would affect other ppl. 

Obviously I won’t go to the wall sympathizing with snow since snow has him killed but sejanus was definitely not being a good friend when he started joining up with the rebels. Snow specifically explained why that would put him in danger too and lo and behold it ends up putting snow in danger. Up until that point sejanus was pretty likeable because he’s just stupid but he’s not bad at all. He ultimately stands against the capital but he’s just way too dumb to understand how to fight back in an effective way.",2023-12-03
"Interesting write up and some great points, I definitely can see what you mean by him being innocent incarnate rather than actively a hypocrite. 

They sorta touch on the point in the movie, when he starts colluding with the rebels Snow confronts him and states that if he’s caught; Snow will hang but Sejanus can just call his dad for a bail out like he always does. His heart is in the right place but he can’t change his place of privilege.

Hope you don’t mind the spoiler but yes they do the same in the movie. He professes his intention to become a medic to “make a difference” and becomes quickly dissatisfied when he’s stuck as infantry, then seeking out the rebels.",2023-11-17
Really nice analysis,2023-12-20

"That was the real name of the Roman leader of Praetorian guard, Lucius Sejanus who later betrayed his emperor Tiberius Caesar but was exposed and killed.

That’s the only time I have heard the name other than the real history (First in I , Claudius).. but I knew it would end badly for him as soon as I heard the name.

The real historical figure lived in almost the exact same time as Jesus Christ as well.",2023-11-19
Seriously why do we need two names that end with “-anus”,2023-12-20
"Sejanus is a Roman name like at least half in the film. Sejanus was famous pretorian prefect who practically ruled Rome when Emperor Tiberius in his old age chose to hang out in Capri. Sejanus also had an affair with widow of Tiberius’s son (maybe even while the son Drusus was alive), she was also a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. 

Sejanus became very close to becoming emperor potentially himself but Tiberius got rid of him quite elegantly in the end by a letter to the Senate. Tiberius was succeed by his grand-newphew Caligula however (Caligula also killed Tiberius’s grandson who was meant to rule with him).",2023-12-20

"It's not a 180, Snow is a POS in the books",2023-11-17
I agree.  The third part of the book felt like it dragged until the last few chapters.  Then someone slammed the gas pedal down and I was left wondering what just happened.  I was actually kind of glad they sped up the third act in the book for a bit.,2023-11-18
"How is it 180? We see Snow act in self interest every step of the way, it’s just that in the first half of the movie his self interests align with Lucy’s",2023-12-25
"Copying this from my other comment:

There was a much, much stronger case for splitting Mockingjay into two than there was for this movie. That book was an action-packed finale with a lot of stuff outside Katniss’s POV to expand on; this book is a low-key one-off character study with fairly relaxed pacing, not building to any particular big climax. There’s also zero good place to split the story anyway.

I know in my bones that if they did split Ballad in two this sub would’ve hated it and complained it wasn’t necessary.",2023-11-19
I rewatched them all with my partner before going to this movie last night and I forgot why I didn't like these movies so much. The first 1.5 hours of Mockingjay Part I is just them going out and shooting propaganda films like 4 times. So much could've been condensed in Part I & Part II.,2023-11-18
Zip it,2023-11-25
"No, I was agreeing with you I think I just worded it badly. What I mean is from a child's perspective (and I was a child when the first one came out and I saw it in the cinema) the blood didn't make it that more scary. The scariest death I remember was Glimmer's and that had no blood. If they dont include blood as to not make it as scary from a child's perspective then imo it makes little difference. It just makes it less immersive and realistic from a more mature audience perspective. Also I don't understand why they cut the blood out anyway as the first film definitely had blood in the arena.",2023-11-20
The other rebel shot Billy,2023-12-16
"All the words he uses for Lucy Gray are incredibly possessive. He views her as belonging to him from the moment she is assigned to him. He does care for his grandmother and Tigris, but he is incredibly dismissive of every single one of his classmates the moment they aren’t useful to him. He acts like he’s worried about Clemencia but also avoids checking in on her and pretends she doesn’t exist, basically, and worries more about how it will blowback on him than he does about her. 

He’s very selfish and narcissistic throughout the book.",2023-11-17
"He loves his family, but foremost as an idea. Not to say he hates his Grandmother/cousin but when his cousin implies she had to prostitute for food he is disgusted. He also seems to have tossed her aside by the time of the main series. 

>He clearly cares for Lucy Gray

He's pretty incelish with her, and it started as a way to help himself. Also it's implied she used him as well. 

>He genuinely worries for Clemensia after she's bitten by snakes

He never visits her or informs anyone about it or tells her parents. He cares in the same way people were posting black squares a few years ago.",2023-11-17
"I feel very surprised by how many people say Snow turning into a villan was out of nowhere.

The first scene of the movie it was him and his sister running through a battlefield to find some food and seeing a man commit cannibalism. He then arrives at home to finds out his father was killed by a person from the district, those who are said to have started the war.

He then goes to ""college"" having to hide the fact his family is bankrupt otherwise he wouldn't be accept in his social circle.

And when he finally have the chance to turn his life around, he gets screwed and sent to be a anonymous peacekeeper in the district. Oh, and he also is betrayed by the person who he helped and fell in love.

The sense of ""me before everyone"", the hatred for the district people, the way he only make good actions if they reward him... It's all there since the BEGINNING. Even when he snitched his friend he did it because that rebel plan would give no benefit for him. 

This movie had one of the best character studies I have ever seen.",2023-12-15
Big agree. I thought it was perfectly shown the conflict,2023-11-20
"I agree that in the book he does display a wide range of emotions and does have a believable internal world. My issue was that the entire time, including after finishing, I physically refused to believe that this man was Snow. 

By the end he was still an idiot, had little to no charm or people skills and spent most of the time internally whining about his lot in life. I just don't believe that this idiot suddenly at some point in his life becomes a completely different person capable of becoming the Snow in the original trilogy.",2023-11-23
"He masterfully manipulates everyone he comes into contact with. He only does things for his gain. In the book you get to hear how the reason he comforted his dying classmate was to look good for the camerasHad he never been banished for cheating he wouldn’t have ever gone to 12 to be with Lucy Gray. Maybe he would have found a way to bring her to him, but it probably would’ve been against her will, and she’d be unhappy, in which he’d promptly dispose of her. 

He was going to leave for 2 without ever mentioning it to Lucy Gray. The second he had a chance to get close to the capital he was going to take it.


Plus Goodbye Lucy Gray, we hardly knew you.” Is not what someone says about someone they truly loved.

He loved her for what she could provide to him and what she represented. The fact that he contemplates breaking it off with her when he has to walk to the far side of town on a hot day to see her shows he isn’t actually in love with her.

He is very good at justifying his dark nature in his head, but Lucy Gray had done nothing to indicate she was gong to attack him. She was literally hiding. He could’ve walked away right there, but he hunted her down. He even found the irony of them having their own private hunger games funny. If Lucy Gray has stayed in the lake house and not clocked on to what he was thinking he would’ve shot her point blank in the head before she had a chance to move.",2023-11-28
">  Snow's characterisation is wonderfully nuanced.  

in the book.  

in the movie, its pretty monotone: as The Hero, the honest, trustworthy, Good Guy.  then he does a 180, becomes Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  that's cheap and dishonest scriptwriting.",2023-12-21
"Sociopaths can have emotions. They're just not generally in relation to other people. Fear, regret, doubt, etc. are all perfectly normal for someone antisocial personality disorder (which is the actual mental health disorder sociopaths and psychopaths both fall into). They can also exhibit signs of outward facing emotion when the would benefit that person. They can even believe they have those emotions themselves. For example, Snow could believe he loves Lucy Gray because expressing that emotion makes it easier to manipulate and use her. But as soon as that emotion isn't beneficial to oneself anymore, that emotion would be gone because it was never real. 

I always took his reaction to Clemensia to be based on shock and fear, and his ""remorse"" for killing the tribute to be for show to manipulate others.

I'd argue times when Snow doesn't do this (for example, when he tries to convince Dr. Gaul to save Lucy Gray after *he* had already ""won"" or when he cries after he gets Plinth executed) are flaws with the story rather showing Snow's actual character.",2023-11-17
Plus the way he treated Tigris,2023-12-02
Great explanation! That was definitely the part of the book that I missed Snow's inner monologue the most.,2023-11-17
"Wow, this explains a lot I couldn't understand, thanks.

Even if the studio would have brought Martin Scorsese to direct this, it would be very, very difficult to do justice to the second paragraph of your explanation. Narration could have been used to fill in the blanks, but it would have felt like it was being spoon-fed to the audience. I don't think there was a right answer to translate it to screen properly, and the actual result is the best they could do.",2023-11-18
"This is really great explanation! 

I think if the director flash backing Snow’s experiences and what he really thinks of things around him the last time he was asked what’s the game for him, it would make his characteristic easier for audiences to understand",2023-11-17
"I do think all of this ís in the movie, just through facial expressions and stuff. As someone who read the book I knew what to look for so I feel like I was able to see all the thoughts going through his head. I think there are a lot of subtleties in the movie that would be fun to discover for people who've read the book or people who are rewatching the movie. (Like with fight Club when you rewatch it you notice the clues) 

For example when sejanus asks him why he was send to 12, he didn't tell him about the poison but did about the snakes. Which makes him look good, which is obviously a specific choice. During the whole movie he's lying and telling only the specific things he knows will have people like him.",2023-11-20
This is a great explanation. The movie definitely fell short I'm explaining his motives. Thank you!,2023-11-17
"Yeah I think the origin of that is what he saw trying to survive in the capital right whenever he found out his dad dies. He saw people eating other people doing he had to eat from the trash and at that point I think in his little child like mine he realized it's all about him and himself and no one else except for maybe his cousin that was with him.

He's definitely a narcissist like in and out and everything he does is for him.",2023-11-19
In the books does one of the shots hit Lucy?,2023-11-20

He never offered it was when. She offered to run away,2023-11-19
"But it wasn't realistic at all. Someone else in the thread said it already: She acts like she's in broadway, clearly playing a part instead of actually acting like how people would react in certain situations. 

I didn't know that there was a hate train for her haha. I looked up the reasons for why she is hated and they all sound a bit ridiculous to me. I just dont think she can act.",2023-11-20
I think if he didn’t drop that he is responsible for sejanus dying she would have been fine. It was the straw that broke the camels back,2023-11-19
"Because with the guns still missing, he was afraid of being caught - he even told her this, that he had no choice but to run now as the guns could appear at any time. While he did love her and did want to run away with her, it was obvious to both that the situation had tipped his decision between being with her and going to officer training in District 2, and that being with her had kind of been his second choice. He wanted to return to the Capitol eventually and have her with him - he says this to her the first day at the lake so she knows this. But she did believe he wanted to come with her both because he loved her but also because he needed to run. 

As soon as they found the guns in the house, and after finding out he had lied and betrayed Sejanus, Lucy was afraid. Now he had the guns, there was no more evidence of the murders....other than her. While he loved her, she knew that the Capitol is where he wanted to be, and after finding out he had no problem getting Sejanus killed to save himself, she believed he could do the same to her.

Whether he was actually going to do that or not is not totally clear - you could see the thought in his mind about having hold of the guns, I personally think he considered it for a moment, but wasn't going to do it until she ran and he thought she would betray him. I do think he wanted to dump the guns and go to District 2, and depending on how that conversation with her went it could have ended up that way anyway - he was quite paranoid and pretty obsessed with having control...",2023-11-20
"> After everything he went through for her, I didn't buy that he would harm her.

Um like what exactly? What did he do that is purely for Lucy Gray? He cheated in the Games because he wanted that Prize. Lucy Gray surviving is just a bonus. His main goal is to win (""It's all about winning"")

Maybe it could be argued that him choosing to be a Peacekeeper in 12 instead of 8 was because of Lucy Gray but at that point he has lost his chance at wealth so he probably thought Lucy Gray is all he had. But then when the moment came that he had a chance to pursue his ambition again, guess who's in the way of that happening. Yes, Lucy Gray.

What did he go through for her exactly? If anything, Lucy Gray got into trouble because of him. And him throwing Lucy Gray under the bus to return to that Capitol life was very much in character.",2023-11-19
Third act had issues. I’m pretty sure everyone involved in this movie or saw it would agree. So you’re statement isn’t off,2023-11-18
I agree. Straight up he risked everything for her already so it didn’t make sense he would just shoot her then,2023-11-20

What's up with Peter obsession with Snows?,2023-11-18
"The funny thing is, after splitting the book into 2 movies, they still cut so much shit

Like you said, part 1 is pretty much about Ron, Harry, and Hermione, but its also about Harry learning more and more about Dumbledore and how he is just a flawed wizard, not this amazing headteacher Harry always though, the movie didn't even bother explaining it more

But least it isn't as insulting as Half Blood Prince that cut nearly all of Voldemort's backstory lol",2023-11-17
"I agree and understand you for thinking the last two movies are boring. It should’ve been one movie. But people telling Katniss what to do is exactly the point. It shows how the whole war something bigger than her and she played just a small part in the whole scheme of things. She starts of the rebellion by becoming a symbol for it, but after that many factors take place and she finds out how she isn’t prepared for some of the things that happen.",2023-11-17
"I feel like you got it backwards? Part 1 was all about the character development/rebellion/lack of action, part 2 was the one with all the shoehorned action scenes.",2023-11-17
I disliked the mockingjay movies so much even the book wasn’t as good tbh I feel like the writing was just better in the first hunger games and catching fire books,2023-11-17
"Mockingjay book has some pretty serious issues all across it, the movies made all of the issues worse and didn't add anything to fix them. I get why they broke it into 2, but it doesn't help that each part just isn't that good and they needed to back off.  I can see why people wanted to make this 2, but it doesn't have a natural break point and act 3 of this movie isn't compelling enough to be its own thing",2023-11-18
I rewatched them before seeing that movie last night. I think between Part I & II there was 6 individual scenes were they're shooting propaganda films. It was all so repetitive.,2023-11-18
"At worst certain people felt that Part 1 was boring and I do think that Part 2 should have used it's single film focus to extend itself a bit to tie up all the loose ends and add in some connective tissue plus more scenes with the other characters. 

But it was still overall a success. It's Breaking Dawn and Divergent and The Hobbit that really showed the horrific consequences of doing the splitting up, plus Mockingjay was in the middle and although not horrific it was still very stretched out and didn't fully earn this choice.",2023-11-18

"> But at a certain point snow gets so powerful nothing Lucy could say would even matter

I mean, didnt Snow talk about how fragile the system multiple times in the series? Maybe Lucy Gray reappearing and telling stories from the olden days wouldnt matter in the slightest.

"Alright fair enough, I feel like I've seen a lot of weird criticism for her when the character feels like more of a mini-celebrity/singer (like how traveling bands tend to be) and she's not really supposed to be like Katniss 1.0.

Yeah I thought we would get more of Clemmie after she was bitten! Also I thought they might put in more of how he realllllly hates mockingjays because they developed outside of Capitol control just to have another tie in to the OG movies. It was interesting that they were able to cut out a lot of the bird studies and Dr. Kay by just having Dr. Gaul explain the jabberjays directly to Snow.,2023-11-17

">Snow risks his life to enter the arena and save Sejanus.

Because Dr Gaul forced him/bribed him with the Plinth Prize, which is Snow's only chance of securing his family's future. That's in the movie. There's no way in hell that Snow would do that of his own accord.

>They also seem to be bonding initially in their time in D12.

Yeah - they do in the book as well. But that's because Snow was homesick to the point of being suicidal, so he was just happy to see *anyone* from home.",2023-12-17
Agree.  Def better than mockingjay 1 and 2.  I kinda agree.  Catching fire was a high for the series.  I would say too response seems to be same at first hunger games also minus the critics (though it still got a tomato),2023-11-20
Understandable for sure.  It's definitely a good addition imo,2023-11-24
She was great for the singing parts. I don’t think she’s a good dramatic actress for serious parts.,2023-11-23
"Honestly, I think there’s more layers to the idea that he was exploiting Lucy to help her and also himself. If you look at it from the idea that he’s a narcissist, it’s easy to draw the conclusion that he wants to be liked and perceived well. In fact, his internal monologue proves as much. He wants to be the best in the room. And by gaining Lucy’s trust and eventual love, he gets his ego fed. So he wants to keep her going because of that, he wants to be loved. 

Eventually, he realizes she figured how he killed Sejanus and he instantly flips. Partially for reasons I outlined in a different comment and partly because that love stopped, so she has no use to him anymore. 

It’s less about keeping Lucy alive because he likes her and more about keeping her alive because *she* likes *him*",2023-11-17

"I read the book and even my ass thought that, whole time I was thinking stay out of his business lol. But the relationship was transactional to Snow (like most of his relationships) especially in the books.

And benefit he did….",2023-11-18

I agree that they did make him sympathetic and moreso in the movie.  I think they did this for casual audiences.  But Tom blythe did say he played snow that the audience would fall in love with him and I think mission accomplished 🤔.   Could also be another reason why you didn't like,2023-11-20
It worked for me.  Tigris even says he can be good.  He had a choice and he chose that side of him that was a manipulator and a cheater.  We see glimpses of it but because Lucy left whelp...it explains so much why he believes he is in the right.,2023-11-20
"Yeah, I guess they “edited” it out when they played it back. Or maybe assumed someone else recorded it?",2023-11-21
Yes. Which is weird because they specifically made him not talk during the recording in the books so that wouldn't be an issue.,2023-12-04
">Rachel Zegler played that scene very emotional and Lucy Gray in the books just silently figured out what the 3rd person is, so it wouldn't provoke Coryo. For me, that part of the scene was yelling lol

Well, they obviously changed it slightly to accommodate film-only viewers and make it more obvious where Lucy Gray's head was at. In the book, we don't know for sure what's going on with Lucy Gray in these scenes, because Snow is (perhaps wilfully) obtuse about the signs of her suspicion and lost in his own thoughts. She is certainly very firm about pressing on the third person in the book and asks him about it *three times*. She also had an ominous line about there being enough ""ghosts"" between them already, which was cut from the film.

I don't agree that Zegler's acting was ""very emotional"" in these scenes or that it included any ""yelling"". Agree to disagree.",2023-12-10

"I agree, what made the book so compelling to me was Snow’s inner monologue. You read how manipulative and fake he can be when it comes to getting people to like him or achieving what he wants. Dean Highbottom (and Dr. Gaul to an extent) is pretty much the only person who sees through the “golden boy” act he’s got going on. Even his friendship with Sejanus only really happened because he never outright bullied nor antagonized Sejanus while they were growing up at school. But his inner monologue shows that he’s very much disgusted by the fact that Sejanus and his family are from the districts. And even though the Snows have fallen on hard times, he still views them as aristocracy far above most people in the Capitol and very much above the people in the districts.",2023-11-19

He even has a short interaction with Strabo Plinth where he expects to be rewarded for saving Sejanus in the arena though nothing comes out of it, only for Strabo Plinth’s generosity to later appear after Sejanus’ death.

"Of course he had remorse for getting Sejanus murdered.  He was a very conflicted character,  that's why he was interesting,  especially in the book.  But the remorse wasn't enough.  He had goodness in him,  like Lucy Grey said. He chose to snuff it out.  Until the very end,  he could have gone either way.  He was never ""faking it"" in his feelings for Lucy or Sejanus. His feelings just weren't enough to overcome his craving for success and power.",2023-11-17

"Cheering after Lucy won? Not feeling remorse over gettjng his best friend killed? I don't know why this has so many upvotes because it just would have made Snow into a Saturday morning cartoon villain and not make any sense. He already showed he was capable of showing affection to his family and friends so he's not a sociopath. 

He obviously loved them but his lust for power and being a geneal asshole makes him a way more interesting character.",2023-11-22
"So like that's the wrong take. Snow isn't a sociopath yet in the story. What makes him a sociopath is that moment.

You got to look at it like seajanis. He is what snow is but without the murdering. They're both people who grew up in wealth and luxury to a certain extent.

While seajanus had monetary wealth he became spoiled that way while snow was spoiled in the fact that he was from the capital. He was taught from a young age that he had to do whatever it took to survive he saw a guy chopping off the body parts of other people.

Him and his family had to eat garbage the districts even killed his family. At this point in time this little boy doesn't think anything wrong with the games he doesn't think anything wrong with the way the world is except for these people literally took everything he had away from him and now he's a poor nobody who's struggling to get by.

Him meeting Lucy gray what's the first hiccup and his entire life at this point he's just trying to do whatever he can do to get his parents some money. But he kind of falls in love with her but it's more of like a I forgot the name of the word if its Stockholm syndrome.

But he falls in love with her and she utilizes him to do whatever it takes to survive. She plays the role up so she can live. But at the same time she realizes that he's offering an olive branch of help and is willing to work with him to get the job done.

But all of her kindness to him is kind of fostering in this false sense that she's into him and that she's there and so he sacrifices everything he has to make sure this girl lives. And at the end of the day he's ready to give everything away to go with her.

So he goes but then he give he's given the offer to go home early to be with his family who he remembers with that phone call that oh wait these are the people I should be fighting for this girl that was with me my entire childhood who was also struggling while I was struggling.

And so he decides to leave but before he can even talk to her about it all that stuff goes down. But he told her that he could that she could trust him and he really meant it in that moment and she had him hooked. So he was really willing to run away and he was willing to give out the rest he had to her.

But he had already lost so much throughout this entire ordeal. and now he had an opportunity to go home and he was seriously considering going home but he realized the right decision at the end of the day was to follow the path for the woman he loves. However when he ask that question to her to know if she was going to be a problem she was already spooked. And so her running away he was freaking out that she was going to go tell on him and it was triggering his like survival instinct.

So then he goes after her thinking he might have to kill her if she's really serious but then he gets bit by the snake and he realizes that she really betrayed him she did not like him she did not love him and she is afraid of him and so in his survival mode he's like you know what let me kill her so that I can continue to survive cuz he realizes how horrific the capital is.

And in that moment is when he truly becomes the president's know we know today where he learned that even though he's given everything to people no one's ever going to do the same for him. Because he did try I'll be at very weakly to help the people in his life not make choices that would get them all killed and at the end of the day they still did that and so he wrongly comes to that conclusion.

That is why snow is the man who he was because he realized that no one's going to come save you no one's going to come help you you got a finagle the system to for you to survive. And he truly starts believing the capital bullshit he doesn't buy into the games being just to keep the people in place he realizes that in order to prevent people from killing him and in order to be the one who is still alive you have to be cutthroat and ruthless.

It's honestly an amazing parallel to real life and like how the actual society is like you have to be ruthless in reality obviously not to that degree in order to make it which shouldn't be the way but it's how it is and you can either vote to play with that system or make your own.

And it honestly shows why snow how he treats katniss later on in the actual series of why he was kind of mean to her but he was very kindly mean to her. And it adds a whole nother layer to him he wasn't just a really mean person and it's why katniss never killed him it's why katniss killed the woman from district 13 instead because she knew he was going to get what he was due but she also recognized what a survivor looks like.

Katniss kind of understood him more than anything and this is also why snow was so nice to katniss even though he did things in the background he never truly killed or harmed her family he was actually very nice in his way of acting and his threat making and everything he did he was trying to help maneuver her to find that ruthless path.

And at the end katniss made similar decisions to him she was equivalently a self-centered and she buried all of that selfishness under Peeta. Even as the series ended she buried that under Peter she realized that she did not deserve to be in this world because snow is literally katniss like they're very similar people. They just both made different choices.

To wind it up cuz I elaborated way too much on this he is an associate path he is just a normal human being but he's eternally trapped in this fight-or-flight kind of mentality because of how he was raised he was brought up through war everyone was against him he had to claw his way up you have to be ruthless to do that it's not about being a sociopath he truly felt emotions when he killed these people but like any other animal out there you have to realize that yes it's going to hurt but you have to just do it or else you're never going to survive.",2023-11-19
"> Snow immediately declaring himself the winning and cheering for himself would have much better highlighted his sociopathy and that he only cared about himself.

When he asks for Lucy to be freed I saw it as him thinking of himself first and foremost, not wanting people to ask themselves why she's surviving and follow the trail up to him.

If he were a sociopath he would have no reason to express that or tell Tigris anything about his feelings. After the trauma of killing someone and then feeling like he had to do more and more desperate measures to protect his family he became more like his dad and gave into primal nature, and in the end comes out like his father. His old self comes out a few times where he feels remorse even later on with Sejanus, he's all alone but still cries...but in the end his new self prevails.

"I guess it goes back to the complexity of the two characters and the interpretation of whether she actually liked him or not.

Seen it play out in other films but he finds the guns and she can see his almost excitement (?) that he could go back to his old life because his biggest worry of guilt was never found. 

She then points out that she is also a link to the horrible things he’s done, even if he didn’t kill her, he was basically suggesting he would abandon her to go back to the capital. This combines with her slight annoyance when Snow reveals that he actually had a posting order to the Officer School that he didn’t tell her about.

Imo, she tries a power play by reminding him he can’t abandon her because she knows what he’s done. As you said, it’s a bit childish/passive aggressive but don’t forget they are meant to be a teenage couple lol. She quickly realised her mistake in that her life wouldn’t keep him in 12, because he could just kill her.

It’s the snake eating it’s own tale then because she makes the first move assuming he had already decided to kill her but it seems he decided against it when he went fishing. At this point he DOES decide to kill her because he thinks the whole thing has been a ruse.

He also proposed the idea that the district with the winning tribute would receive more rations for the year that they win, along with a designated ""Victor's Village"" area in each district for the winners.

We are all just several instances of heartbreak before we turn into snow. Same with like I think her main emphasis is that like katniss and snow were so similar they're both selfish people who only have their survival and their family survival at heart.

Katniss even kills the leader of the rebel army just to get back at her for killing her sister. They're both very selfish self-centered people the difference is katniss instead of you know put people beneath her for her own actions has people throwing themselves under her to bolster her survival.

While snow put people under him for him to survive and thrive. They have very similar stories that are almost mirror like. But just calling him a sociopath you know doesn't really justify that in my opinion. If anyone's truly a sociopath it's the lady who runs district 13 and throws children under the bus just to save and take power of everyone.

I'm going to listen to the book now and then once I finish that I'll have a better understanding but I really think that like while snow is a very evil person he's very similar to a lot of politicians out there and a lot of people out there who put themselves in their own success over everyone else like it it feels almost normal to me.

The point is really that most villains are not one-dimensional, and did not get to their position or perspective by default, but rather were pushed or manipulated. Most villains had feelings, attachments, desires, and needs. 

Take away those things, and you’re left with the corrupted being within. Very few people are born wanting to be evil, but many are forced into that path, especially if they have no guidance or direction otherwise. Think of any of your favorite villains or antagonists, and consider how they became that way. Can you relate or empathize with their background or do you feel it does not justify their actions? That’s what I feel makes a good villain. Take into account Star Wars again. You mentioned Anakin’s rise and eventual downfall, yet he became a hero once again. The audience identifies with him.

But consider someone like The Joker or Cletus Kasady, who were evil from the beginning (for the most part anyhow). Sure, their gory adventures might be fun, but there’s no substance. They commit violence for the hell of it, not due to some misinformed/misinterpreted perspective. Their actions hold no purpose except to cause chaos and destruction. They’re one dimensional, and they become quite boring due to the repetitiveness and lack of motivation. 

Snow was wrong for continuing the Hunger Games, and for his hatred of the districts, but at least we have knowledge of how he became this way. It doesn’t justify him being a bigot, but doesn’t put him completely at fault either. Change some things around, and he might’ve been a hero.",2023-12-06
But there’s zero display of conflict for him. You don’t see him weighing whether to send the Jay or anything.

Gaul and Highbottom were both malign influences in their own way, and ""loathing and scorn"" fits their treatment of Snow well.

The most recent film I think retcons this a bit as 12 is supposed to be the most eastern-facing district, but it's still fairly accurate.

The areas just outside of the boundaries are wildlands, open-ish at first from the war through the 10th annual Games, by Katniss's time they are more heavily reinforced boundaries ""to keep the wildlife out"" (and really to keep the people in). The parts further out are presumably uninhabitable due to a combination of nuclear fallout and flooded due to rising sea levels from climate change.

"Well the actual character should all have really strong Southern accents and they should be like really really thick accents if they're truly we're located where they're located at because all the coal mines in that region are located directly where you would have a strong southern accent.

I know there was a fan theory that Maude Ivory (Lucy’s cousin - the little girl in the movie) is her grandmother. Either way, it’s not stated outright but there’s enough there to make us think the author wanted us to make the connection, IMO

Edit: I looked up the theories and I forgot the Covey even have the same house as Katniss’ family in the books.

This passage seems pretty selfless to me:

He felt a bittersweet *pang at the thought of her watching him die*, but *gratitude that she would survive*. He was the only one left who could place her at the murders. She hadn't touched the weapons. Whatever happened to him, *there was comfort in knowing she would live on for the both of them*. (pp. 478-9)

Another selfless moment:

>He checked the mail and found a box from Pluribus, loaded with packets of strings for assorted musical instruments and a kind note saying there was no charge.  He put them in his locker, *happy at the thought of how happy the Covey would be* when it was safe enough to see them again. (p. 467)

Does he have some sociopathic tendencies yes. But he makes a lot of very human decisions that a lot of people today also would make.",2023-11-19
">All the words he uses for Lucy Gray are incredibly possessive. He views her as belonging to him from the moment she is assigned to him.

To be fair to Snow, he has reasonable grounds to be jealous and insecure when it comes to Lucy Gray.

1. She is *very* flirtatious. She says herself, ""I flirt with anybody"".
2. It's *strongly* implied in the book - less so in the film, but there are still the lyrics about ""spreading kisses like honey"" and ""living by her charms"" - that Lucy Gray has a history of prostituting herself to survive. Sure, Snow is understandably not thrilled about this, but he proceeds with the relationship, anyway. I dare say that Snow shows more tolerance in this regard than the vast majority of men would, particularly 18-yr-olds. That would be a dealbreaker for most guys.
3. Lucy Gray has an ex-boyfriend poking around and seemingly trying to get back together with her, and she fails to *wholly* reassure Snow on the matter.

Snow *is* possessive, but I'd say that a lot of it is down to his insecurity in the relationship and strong desire for romantic and sexual exclusivity. IIRR, he doesn't get possessive when it comes to the Covey, with whom Lucy Gray spends most of her time. Meanwhile, there is absolutely no-one else for Snow but Lucy Gray, and there never has been, so the relationship is not exactly equal in that sense.

Even so, Lucy Gray says to him, ""You're mine and I'm yours. It's written in the stars."" This is an intense, life-or-death teenage romance, so the language of ""belonging"" and ""destiny"" and such is par for the course.

I also think that the text *strongly* supports a psychoanalytic/Freudian interpretation of Snow's possessive attitude. What we might call his anxious attachment style is pretty clearly rooted in the childhood trauma of losing his mother in the war. Snow explicitly associates her with Lucy Gray in the book, as she was  also a beautiful, appearance-conscious woman who used to sing to him. He gives Lucy Gray two items that belonged to his mother, including his most precious possession, i.e., the silver compact. And Lucy Gray brings out a vulnerable, soft side of him that he otherwise only lets out when alone in the dark with the compact.

I really wish they had shown the emotional significance of the compact in the movie. That was the most detrimental omission to me. It really gets to the heart of the traumatised child of war at the core of Snow's being.",2023-11-23
"> had little to no charm or people skills

We'll have to agree to disagree. He charmed the pants off the Covey, especially Lucy Gray (obviously) and Maude Ivory, even adopting their idiom to please them (""Sweets to the sweet"" and such). All his military bunkmates seemed to like him. He keeps up a beneficial relationship with Pluribus Bell. He had enough tact and people skills to fool the Plinths, including Sejanus himself, into thinking he was actually their son's close friend. He's friends with many of his classmates and allegedly even has a reputation as a ""player"".",2023-11-23
"Thanks for the info, doctor.

It seems that you read the book selectively, interpreting Snow's thoughts and feelings so that they would fit your predetermined diagnosis, and ignoring the parts that you were unable to make fit. I don't understand why some readers seem to want Snow to be *less* complex and interesting than he is...

Below is just one example when Snow is clearly overcome by genuine emotion and compassion for Lucy Gray (yes, he fleetingly thinks of himself here, but his predominant concern is clearly her welfare). He ignores the rules/guard to be there for her. He even puts aside his own concerns to focus on her, because ""it all paled in comparison to her situation"".

>Coriolanus had a terrible image of her lying dead under a swarm of rats. It wiped away the last few shreds of resistance he had, and *despair engulfed him*. *For her.* For himself. For the both of them. “Oh, Lucy Gray, *I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry about all of this*.” “It’s not your fault,” she said. “You must hate me. *You should. I would hate me,”* he said. “I don’t hate you. The Hunger Games weren’t your idea,” she replied. “But I’m participating in them. I’m helping them happen!” *His head dropped in shame. “I should be like Sejanus and at least try to quit.”* “No, don’t! Please don’t. Don’t leave me to go through this alone!” She took a step toward him and almost fainted. Her hands caught the bars, and she slid down to the ground. *Ignoring the guard’s warning*, he impulsively stepped over the rock and crouched down across the bars from her. “*Are you all right?”* She nodded, but she didn’t look all right. He’d wanted to tell her about the scare with the snakes and Clemensia’s brush with death. He’d hoped to ask her advice, but *it all paled in comparison to her situation.*

I don’t think she knew the guns were there.  She didn’t even want to stop at the cabin.  That was his idea.,2023-11-22
"I’ve only seen the movie (last night) but I do feel he genuinely cared for Lucy and that he does do a lot for her through the games that wasn’t about just “winning” (the prize at least).

For starters, Sejanus says in the beginning that that there was no prize this year, and given that it was his father who paid for it, I think he has the best insight to this even if everyone still talked about the prize.

Secondly, Highbottom also explicitly tells Coriolanus that he would do everything he could to make sure he never won a cent of that prize, that was more or less the story telling us that even in the face of not getting something he wants, he is still willing to risk everything to save her by putting his handkerchief with his father’s initials in the snake tank.

It gets mixed a lot because of how often his selfish gains overlap with helping Lucy but I think it’s less interesting to make it so he never really cared about her. As much as people want to say he was “just a sociopath,” he made every decision with purpose, he ultimately was selfish in his actions but they weren’t “easy” due to not caring about people. I agree that betraying Lucy was in line with his character, but because he wanted the capital more than he wanted a life with her, not because he only cared about the capital and nothing for her.",2023-11-23
">He cheated in the Games because he wanted that Prize. Lucy Gray surviving is just a bonus.

It's the other way around. And Snow knew there was a good chance that his cheating would be found out, and so the Prize would be forfeit and his future ruined, but at least Lucy Gray would survive. In fact, in the movie, Highbottom tells Snow that he will do ""everything in \[his\] power"" to make sure he doesn't get ""a dime"", even if he wins, and asks Snow if he *still* cares whether Lucy Gray survives now. Turns out he did!

His impulsive decision to slip in the handkerchief was directly inspired by a graphic and haunting vision of her being killed by the snakes:

>**With a sharp pang**, **Coriolanus had a vision of Lucy Gray** in their final meeting, clutching his hand as he promised her they could win. But there was **no way he could protect her** from the creatures in this tank... (p. 283, UK edition)  
>  
>What had he done? What on earth had he done? His heart raced as he blindly turned down one street and then another, trying to make sense of his actions.  ... He'd done it so they would not bite her \[Lucy Gray\] as they had Clemensia. So they would not kill her. **Because he cared about her.** Because he cared about her? Or because he wanted her to win the Hunger Games so that he could secure the Plinth Prize? (p. 283)

Snow second-guesses himself and tries to ""rationalise"" his actions, but it's clear to me that his first thought is the true one. It's especially clear when he dreams of her that night:

>He crawled into bed, where he dreamed of Lucy Gray being hunted by the rainbow snakes. **He awoke with a start, trembling**...  **Y*****ou have got to hold yourself together***, he told himself. *The Games can't last much longer*. (p. 292)

Our dreams reveal the true desires and fears in our hearts, safe from the rationalisation and control of the conscious mind. And Snow dreams of Lucy Gray often.

And all of this is reinforced by the earlier scene of their final meeting before the Games:

>**Coriolanus felt something inside him unravel** as he saw her helplessness and felt his own. He reached for her. ""Oh, Lucy Gray...""  
>  
>...  
>  
>""I'll be a wreck tomorrow! **When I told you that you mattered to me**, I didn't mean as my tribute. **I meant as you**. You, Lucy Gray Baird, **as a person**. As my friend. As my---"" What was the word for it? Sweetheart? Girlfriend? He could not claim more than a crush, and that might be one-sided. But what could he possibly have to lose by admitting that she'd gotten to him? ""I felt jealous after your ballad, because I wanted you to be thinking about me, not someone from your past. It's stupid, I know. But you're the most incredible girl I've ever met. Really. Extraordinary in every way. And I---"" **Tears welled in his own eyes**, but he blinked them away. He had to stay strong for them both. ""And **I don't want to lose you. I refuse to lose you.""**  
>  
>...  
>  
>She was his girl, **she had saved his life, and he had to do everything he could to save hers.** \[This is just before he gives her the compact.\] ... **It's my most precious possession.** I want you to have it in the arena, for good luck."" ... ""Go on,"" he urged her. ""**Take me with you.** Take it.""... (pp. 189-192)

I don't care what anyone says: that's some intense and heartfelt romantic shit. And he could have given her literally *anything* to store the rat poison, but he chose to give her *his most precious possession -* the symbol of his dead mother *-* as a grand romantic gesture.

Curious what you think about a thought I had. The movie leaves Lucy's disappearance a mystery. The obvious idea is that she dipped because they're just on different sides, but it does say she never resurfaces. Do you think it's possible Viola was watching Snow and had her taken to bring him back? Idk why but their final scene together felt almost like a man behind the curtain moment with how confident she was he'd be back.",2023-11-17
"yeah i think that's why i got confused when watching the movie. Like why would you drink that lollll. You've been hating on Snow's family guts and desire for power and getting to the top for all your life, why the fuck would you consume anything they offer you.",2023-11-27
"as someone who hadn't read the book (i did read the og HG trilogy back 10 years ago) I didn't expect this to be a true ""Hunger Games"" movie but i felt like the movie had everything, it was tense, dramatic, slightly depressing, had beautiful moments, some rather hysterical moments (Thanks, Jason Schwarzman) and the music was lovely. overall just a good movie even if it maybe could've been better, the final third of the movie probably translates better in book form than as a movie but it was still good",2023-11-20
"Oh, that’s unfortunate lmao. I’m way past my YA phase, but I still kind of want to read the book now, because people are saying Snow has many conflicting trains of thoughts, for example about Lucy, and I looove villain protagonists. I’m sad the movie didn’t entirely do him justice.",2023-11-19
I mean the whole reason Sejanus is even there is because if Snow's bullshit excuse to get him out of the arena.,2023-11-25
"Oh I guess that makes sense. It can be a bit distracting I suppose, though I didn't really mind it.",2023-11-18
Yeah completely forced garbage to get her singing.,2023-12-04
Yeah its maybe becuase  I just didn't care about snow like at all....and lucy wasnt that interesting either.  Low-key the only thing I liked was the singing parts....,2023-11-20
"I'm not saying it makes sense.  I'm saying that the PG-13 rating is the reason blood isn't shown.  It was the same in all of the original movies, too.",2023-11-18

So the bombing and the gifts made the games far more interesting.",2023-11-18
It's weird they were called The Hunger Games. I always read that as a reference to the kids having to survive for Days/Weeks without food.,2023-12-08

"If you really want to know, there isn’t any internal monologue, which I think was completely the right thing to do.
I honestly really like how you can see the difference between the book and movie because of this because you get to see the perspective of Snow from everyone else’s eyes. It was also fun because after reading the book, you know what he’s thinking in the movie in certain scenes",2023-12-02
"I don’t think the movie explained his character well. If I remember from the book, he used to live in District 2 and dad made money off of the war. So much that they were able to move to the capitol and be upper class there, which is character resented",2023-11-18
When Snow said they were just like 17-19 in the movie I was taken aback 😳 I thought they were all supposed to be portrayed as mid twenties,2023-11-28
"Seriously he was 28, lol, he didn't look 28.

Yes, his Dad did help him one time, but he was punished as a peacekeper in district 12.",2023-11-18
"I haven't seen the movie yet, just finished the book but if you think Serjanus was privileged then they did not do a good job of portraying his character in the movie. He hated the Capitol he was from District 2 and always considered himself aligned with the districts even though he was given tons of money. He knew it was blood money. He hated his father made money off district deaths and the war.",2023-12-10
Who is 28?,2023-12-17
"It doesn't matter, he found himself in a position that went against his morals.",2023-11-25
"That doesn't make him privileged. He didn't ask for the privileges, he didn't ask to participate in this twisted game. You can hardly blame him.",2023-11-25

It could use the extra time, but I'm against splitting movies, especially since it's a prequel.",2023-11-28
Apples and oranges.,2023-11-18
In the book you get to hear how the reason he comforted his dying classmate was to look good for the cameras,2023-11-23
"Ooh, I'll have to read this then. Those are the bits I was wanting to see more of. I was so confused at the end of the movie when he was given the scholarship - why would they be so generous to him? There was also the implication that he stood to inherit their fortune which makes much more sense in light of the context now.",2023-11-19
I thought it was communicated well through the one-two punch with the picture and the fact that he was the one who got Sejanus killed. Like the reward for his actions was there imo.,2023-12-01
I am not a clever man. Honestly just wanted a quick reddit review comparing it in quality to the rest of the series. Missed the goddamn thread title,2023-12-12
"To be fair, in his whole life, his dad did always recuse him, or friends.",2023-11-17
"Beautifully worded. 

I love how this movie dealt with realistic depictions of human beings in different roles. They weren’t shown as saints and devils. They were realistic complex young people who are conflicted about so many things and having their own struggles, fears, contradictions and things that they love and other things that they love more, which make them give up on what they love a bit less.

Not to mention the massive impact of upbringing, family values, government propaganda and manipulation and personal response/reaction to those elements around them. No one is fully selfless, nor should they be, but there were degrees of how someone is willing to bend rules or justify certain means for their own ends. 

Yes, Sejanus’ fear doesn’t take away anything from his concern and activism, and this isn’t anything against him, but he was brought up rich and always got himself into trouble and had his family’s wealth and power to shield him. He’s always been sheltered from the consequences others’ faced, and he didn’t take advantage of that in a malicious way.

But when you’re not used to something and reality suddenly sets in, your survival instinct speaks louder than the composure and determination you wanted so much to think that you’ve had.

As someone from Iraq, people where I’m from including children who grew up during the war and its aftermath with all the ongoing explosions, have become quite desensitized to the sound of bombings or the news of somebody’s death or kidnapping, that it all became just another daily occurrence, at the time. 

You could be an avid activist from a western country who genuinely cares, but you actually go and live there and you might not be able to withstand the fear of actually being there. It doesn’t mean you were fake, it just means living through it is nothing like watching videos of it. 

And it also doesn’t mean the people from there have become heartless savages or violent people, no. They’re very much human beings capable of the most passionate love, empathy, fear, joy, and all kinds of human emotions. It’s just that they got used to seeing this terror on daily basis to the point where it became the norm. They don’t think it’s ok, they don’t accept it. They just understand that they can’t do anything about it and that it’s common to the point where the struggles of the people of the Capitol are so small, compared to what they faced. 

I love them for depicting these details so realistically here.",2023-11-18
His Daddy always bought him out of trouble before.,2023-11-18
He grew up in 2 so wealthy they were able to buy their way into the capital.,2023-11-18
I also think it goes to show how new the games are and how many loopholes could happen lol like in modern hunger games they have to get out of their old clothes and use skin tight clothes to show they can’t bring anything or try to cheat. Like how the hunger games have improved over the years and i thought that was cool lol,2023-12-16
Not one you could use in a blood bath type fight though,2023-11-22
"I felt better about it in the book. She gathered the rat poison herself, Snow just gave her his mother's compact as a token of his affection and vaguely hinted that should could put \*\*SOMETHING\*\* (cough cough wink wink) in it. She went about gathering the rat poison in it herself. Still cheating, sure. But not as extreme.",2023-12-28
"It technically only led to 2 kills. The only ""beneficial one"" was of the lumberjack who obviously was a strong fighter... But the tuberculosis girl was never a threat at all. So really it wasn't majorly impactful, depending on how great the lumberjack may have been. I think it was a matter of time before lumberjack would have turned on the red headed psycho girl... So eventually it could have been Lucy Gray vs Lumberjack and snakes would have won that battle anyway.",2024-01-01

"The cabin was already there as we see the outside of it when they go swimming.

I think the change started to happen when Snow accidentally revealed he had killed 3 people rather then 2 and lied to her about the third. She knew she couldn’t trust him then.",2023-12-22
She said above all even love she values trust. He lied to her about the third person he killed and then she realised she couldn’t trust him not to kill her as she was a loose end for him to ever get back home. Someone in this thread also mentioned he always kept telling her to ‘run’ in the film and in the end that’s what she did,2024-01-17

"I feel like on the other side the people in his life just kept letting him down.

Yes this is the right answer. I do think there could have been a better job fleshing this out in the movie but this is what the story is going for. Not that he’s devoid of emotion and a sociopath.,2023-11-26

I feel like there’s tells indicating both that she was working him AND that she’s just a genuine person who loves hard the whole film, as you said - leaves it open to interpretation.

I could see it being her tricking him the whole time or she’s truthful and the second her trust breaks, she fears him and leaves.",2023-11-17
"It's very ambiguous in the book as well.  I actually thought it made a little more sense in the movie.  The third part of the book kind of drags and then in the last few chapters, its like someone slams the gas pedal down.",2023-11-18
that’s what i thought too! because of the fact that she knows he lied and has killed three people and she puts trust above everything,2023-11-21
Interesting. Maybe that’s why he was so mad about Katnis faking her love for Peta at first.,2023-11-23
"While reading this I thought about the scene where Crassus tells Snow he wont be getting the money and says something along the lines of “Now we’ll see whether you really want her to win.” I think this somewhat proves that Snow loved her.

Also the line at the end where he says he realized what you love most is what destroys you is also proof. She destroyed him and made him into what he became.",2023-12-10

"War is brutal and humans convince themselves ""they need to fight and kill"". Like you said, humans justify alot. I always say this when I'm playing poker ""Poker players lie to themselves more than lie to anyone else"" which is unbelievably true in poker, but also in life. Being ""self aware"" and have a basic understanding of the facts or the truth appears to be more rare than it should be. Humans dance with ideas and convince themselves of various lies. It's real wild! It's almost as if humans have an addiction to fantasy? Or an addiction to having a confirmation bias that ""they are always right"" even when evidence proves them wrong? Like an egotistical operation/disease? I think we saw this development in Snow very much too... ""Snow always ends up on top"" He declared right before poisoning that midget dude...

However, it was only when he got bit by the snake, which Lucy set up, that he went berserk thinking she betrayed him",2023-11-27
"Indeed. He wasn’t “born bad”, like most people aren’t born bad. He’s just a product of his own circumstances and ultimately his own choices accordingly.",2023-11-18
"No, in the book, someone else was going to shoot her and was blocked, so Snow shot her instead. It was completely deliberate in both cases.

However, iirr, they actually had Mayfair explicitly tell the rebels that she would get them all hanged in the film, so Snow had an even stronger motive.",2023-11-18
"Shooting Mayfair is a poor example IMO, she was credibly threatening to have them all hanged.",2023-11-25
"I mean, highbottom was intentionally and actively trying to ruin his life and his family with poverty. It’s not hard to believe at that point, when he’s already killed three people, that he’d kill his enemy too, especially if you can justify it with highbottom being someone who was addicted to drugs and had nothing to live for, hated his life and his role in the games etc.",2023-11-24
Whenever he had a choice he made the selfish choice.,2023-11-18
This is the answer. See what ultimately happens to Tigris in Mockingjay. At some point between the two movies/books he gets rid of her when she's no longer useful.,2023-11-29

"I think it absolutely was, but the ending scene makes it a little bit more muddy. I think he held a huge grudge against his father, because of what he did when they were both in school. And I think he was taking it out on Coryo much more than was proportionate. He seemed to have a personal vendetta against somebody who never did anything to him. 

And I think his guilt over having been the one to come up with the games was eating him alive and it was spilling over into his anger against the snows.",2023-11-19
"I don't think he was mean at all. He certainly seems mean in the beginning but he accurately pegged Snow as being as much of a monster as his father and was trying to stop him from getting more power and influence. 

Let's not forget that he's Headmaster of the Academy and might be more familiar with Coryo than we know. It's possible he'd already seen some of his essays and known exactly how little Coryo cared about the people from the Districts.",2023-11-26

"Yeah the interesting part is, he does have all the good things in him. But he wants power and prestige more. It takes the plot of the book to teach him that he really does want to kill the good part in him, because his ambition is in reach.

When he's failing, he thinks he's been killing himself trying to live up to his family name and the flashy things he wants, but losing isn't actually that bad. He does like lucy, the covey, the simplicity. But it isn't perfect, he has biases, and discomforts he would need to work through. He could if he tried.

Just truncate the first film into 70-80 mins perhaps then the second into the next 100 mins. I'm sure there's a fanedit out there that does this.

I feel like even beyond them not wanting to make a long movie, they just didn't want to either not include stuff from the book or just cash in on this trend that would make them loads more money.",2023-11-18
"I think if you haven't read it, the movie won't make as much sense. It could also be that this plot just wasn't for you, Lucy gray is meant to be a performer and the story isn't action heavy like the original movie/books",2023-12-25
"That’s one change I didn’t love, how Highbottom’s “contacts” say she disappeared. Her fate much more ambiguous in the book and it’s meant to be.

She sings a song about someone with the same name, Lucy Grey. It’s actually a poem from ralph waldo emerson and in the poem, that lucy grey’s fate is also ambiguous (if you remember, Snow ask her if she thinks the Lucy Grey in the song survived and she does). We’re never supposed to know if she gets away or dies. 

Personally, I don’t think Gaul took her or was involved with Lucy Greg’s fate. But it is sort of man behind the curtain because Gaul did orchestrate this whole thing a bit. She asked Snow how his summer was and said she wanted him to experience the real world and wasn’t going to “let you sit around doing nothing, taking care of your curls” (or something to that effect). She was always going to bring Snow back, that’s how she knew he was coming back.",2023-11-17

I'm thinking of what could have made the movie better than its hard to because it is based on a book..but for some more kissing lol, for others more motivational explanation to what happened in the snow change and Lucy gray, and overall more connections to the first hunger games movie BUT all of these have a reason for not being in the movie.",2023-11-20

She even cooks and packs him food too. He has a short interaction with Strabo Plinth, but you get the vibe that Strabo wishes his son would be more like Snow. Which is basically why the Plinths essentially adopt Snow and his family in all but name after Sejanus’ death. The Plinth fortune is a big reason why Snow is able to enter university and why he’s so wealthy by the time we see him in Katniss’ era.",2023-11-20

I guess I cant really have a say in it because Ive never read the books and havent even watched the series, just watched the original movie a long time ago, but if it just started out with Snow being evil from the get go it would have been much worse. A large majority of the emotion would have been ripped away.",2023-12-10

I think it was the scene where he said he killed three people that was the turning point for her. You could tell she felt instantly betrayed because of how she begged him to tell her who it was.

And when he says he killed his old self she realizes what he has become. Also, if she was in love with him, that version of him that she fell in love with is now gone, killed.

It’s much more likely OP was confused by Lucy making the decision to run internally and that not being visually communicated to the audience/her true agenda being left open for interpretation the whole film.",2023-11-22

"The number of disabled tributes fits in with the reaping of Lucy Grey.  There was no benefit in having someone that can win enter the games so many of the districts sent kids who they ""could live without"" because why not send the kid who would be taxing on your community (poor wovy) or the kid who is a problem instead of someone good.

"In this future, there’s nuclear wars, rising sea levels, etc. It’s assumed that The Capitol usurped or replaced the US government. There’s no mention of the rest of the world. Panem has a population of 1.9M people. It’s assumed that the districts are surviving settlements from nuclear wars, and that The Capitol took over them. An interesting note is that The Capitol is located in Colorado where the presidential bunker is situated. 

It’s assumed other countries are either completely isolated or destroyed each other, for example Canada, Mexico, and the US are all merged as Panem. 

The Hunger Games begin after District 13 rebels against the Capitol dictatorship, (D13 controls nuclear weapons/energy). For 2-3 years the Capitols resources were cut off from the districts, which explains why some Capitol residents were so poor. D13 threatened mutual destruction with nuclear weapons, so the Capitol cedes them as an independent state. This is also why Snows family is broke, most of their assets were invested in D13 weaponry.",2023-11-20

He warned Sejanus multiple times that he was playing revolutionary with safety nets, a luxury that he doesn't have what the hell else was he gonna do at that point?

It is the life and death that heavily should weigh. Even if someone is lying to get a better grade and favor shouldn't mean letting them get seriously hurt or killed. Snow could have stopped her before she put her hand in and come clean.

He knew she would be caught and aided her in her fatal tragedy.,2023-12-24

If someone watches that scene and gets confused what happens, I'm gonna assume they have forgotten the trust scene/didn't pay too much attention at it. Because otherwise, there's little room for confusion.

A lot of which result in him not being seen as a sympathetic character which is pretty upsetting to read... like for example, ""he's just a privileged kid who thinks he's free of all consequences for his actions or ideas"", almost in a way suggesting he deserved an incredible betrayal costing him everything lol. 

He's deeply conflicted and isolated as he feels like a stranger among his peers but would also be a stranger among his District 2 peers as well. I assume he received most of his worldview mostly from his Ma who by all accounts seems to be a prototypical ""good person"". That's my understanding anyway. I think he's an idealist and courageous. I don't think his actions and thoughts were purposeless or done without thought. He is arguably the most important character in the book in my eyes and to see him barely get screen time left me thinking people who see the movie can't possibly understand Snow's psyche other than at a very surface level of ""Snow bad"".  


I've seen a lot of people come away from the movie like Snow is doing what he has to in order to survive... but he's choosing to do so without much remorse after a short consideration. He really shouldn't be seen as much more than a true evil :\\. Obviously, this is all imo.",2023-11-22

I just watched the movie, didnt read the book. Honestly, I think the movie did a pretty good job establishing his feelings and motivations. Its made clear from the beginning that hes an outcast among his supposed peers because hes from district 2, not the Capitol. He straight up spells it out that he got assigned to his old friend because they want to show him that he can no longer be any kind of friend to anyone of district 2 ever again. To show him that he doesnt belong there anymore. 

Then you get his genuine care for his friend in like 2 or 3 scenes. I dont know, I dont think you need to see more to understand why hes vehemently anti-hunger games and anti-capitol, do you?",2024-01-07
"By any definition Sejanus enjoys societal and financial privilege over the people in the districts during the events of the movie/books. Everyone in the Capitol does. Doesn't matter that he at one point wasn't privileged.

King Kong (2005) was PG-13 and 3 hours long; lots of people went to see that. All three LOTR movies are each 3 hours long and were all PG/PG-13. The Return of the King was literally nearly 3 and a half hours long.,2023-11-20
"yes, the district are used to dealing with it regularly like beatings, and executions, poor guy wasn't ready to handle the consequences.",2023-11-18
"The fact that Snow turned out to be a murderous sociopath later on in his life has no bearing on his actions in this specific film. None of what he did in this film would be considered sociopathic except for killing Highbottom in the end. In fact, I would wager that most people would do exactly what he did if they were in his position faced with those circumstances",2023-12-13
"He was 100% a sociopath from the very beginning of the movie, and you are completely correct.",2023-11-22
"I mean the book was also a slow burn into the decent of evil. 

Sure he justified a lot of actions with if I do this it will
help me too. But that doesn’t make someone bad.",2024-01-11
"I mean, the book is from Snow's point of view.  He ended up feeling like she played him, but its debatable whether she actually did or not.  We only have his POV to judge from.",2023-12-31
"I bet what you mean, but given how far the Gamemaster was willing to go in the first place he could’ve easily got himself injured or killed too. I don’t think being scared in a scary situation is a red flag. However what is kinda concerning to me is the fact that he was even able to write that paper in the first place after having someone die in his arms earlier that day. I think one of the background characters even commented on that too.",2023-12-24
"I'm sure you'd love to say that, yes. How many people are willing to ACTUALLY die for a kid that isn't their sibling? Heck, even a sibling?",2023-11-21
"In the first book Katniss mentions Greasy Sae has a mentally disabled granddaughter who the residents of District 12 treat as some sort of pet and toss her scraps and things. So likely they don’t go out of their way for them but view them as pretty harmless. But District 12 is the most neglected District, so I can’t say how they’re viewed anywhere else in Panem.",2023-11-26
"They weren't supposed to, but obviously were able to. Maybe some of them rigged the reaping to send the disabled kids, just to be able to justify their own participation in the horrors for themselves? I'm (invisibly) disabled and have experienced how some people shift how they value me in mere seconds after finding out. 

Eugenics runs deep in our culture and the leap isn't far from ""babies with disabling syndromes shouldn't be born"" to ""if two of the kids has to die, it should be those who would have shorter lifespan expectancies anyway"". Just look at the millions poured into genetics/prevention research, compared to how little is spent on life quality research and practical support for disabled folks.",2023-12-04
"You can't be serious right? The country that purposefully keeps Gazans on the brink of starvation and controls their electricity, water, and movement? Lmfao 

You in the hunger games: ""The rebels actually restarted the war when they bombed the arena, and the Capitol has done more for the Districts than the rebels ever have.""",2023-11-29
Omg same. I staerted crying. THe actress did such a good job!,2023-12-29
"Agreed, and it was all happening so fast I think he panicked.",2023-11-19
"Completely agree and when you consider the setting, that these people are incredibly oppressed by the capital and only have each other to rely on, a snitch is a threat to everyone, technically.

It was cold how he smoothly picked up the gun and pulled the trigger, sure, but the killing itself was self-defense tbh.",2023-11-19
LITERALLY like his actions were super understandable and valid😭,2023-11-29
Canada and Mexico are also included as parts of Panem but it could be that the far northern parts of North America like northern Quebec are uninhabited.,2023-11-23
Agree with u/funnyunfunny and I've read the book.,2024-02-17
Same situation for me. I don’t have Twitter or Tik Tok. Didn’t know a single thing about her beforehand. Didn’t know of any controversy. Absolutely did not like her performance.,2023-11-28
Fair enough.  You might not have Twitter.  Her name was trending for days and that's when I realized she's being unfairly targeted.  Your criticism being unrelated is a relief.,2023-11-25
That last sentence is the perfect way to say what felt like plot armor lol,2023-11-19
Ok,2023-11-18
Movie and food. CAD currency btw.,2023-12-04
"He was so divorced from the realities of the world he was living in due to the money his father had, and while he tried to make things better for those around him, he never comprehended what any of it really meant.

He wasn't resolute enough to stand with the rebels, because he never thought he could ever be at risk, because all of his prior incidents in his life were fixed by someone else. His fathers money, or in the area, Coriolanus intervening. 

He was lulled into a false sense of security, to not be careful, to not be fearful, and he died because of it.",2023-11-20
"Hmm between the poor Snow who manipulated, gaslit, used and threw away people - some of whom genuinely cared for him - for his own ends versus the privileged kid who genuinely wants to help people in probably the most idealistic and frustratingly naive way, I'll take Serjanus anyday, thank you.",2023-11-20
"Really, you’re going to criticize Serjanus who could have lived a life of luxury and instead chose to give it all up AND his life? He gained NOTHING by his choices.",2023-11-23
"Just watched the movie. Didn’t read the book but I did read the OG trilogy and saw those movies as well. 

My gf (who didn’t read any of the books but has seen all the movies) and I both came to the same conclusion. Basically that Snow chose a comfortable life over Lucy/Sejanus and his actions in the later half reflected that. I definitely didn’t get that he did what he had to do to survive. 

If anything I think the weirdest part of the movie to me was the Lucy/Snow romance. It felt very forced- especially on her end.",2023-11-24
"As to your last paragraph, people are coming away from the movie with the same attitude as Coryo then. He justifies everything he has done by telling himself he had to do it to survive, but it’s just an excuse and he becomes more and more immune to guilt.",2023-11-22
I thought the intro of all the students handled this well. Maybe it's a bit more muddled later in the movie but I think Coriolanus' motivations are much more muddled towards the end in the movie than Sejanus',2023-12-17
"From the book they go into his family history, that his family profited off the war by selling weapons or something, which is the only reason they got to move to the capitol. So he had this new fancy life but at the expense of the old district his was from, which was literally killing his friends",2024-01-07
"Thank you explaining this. People forget that privelege doesn't make you a bad person. This is why some people get triggered by the phrase ""white privelege"" because they think you assumed you lived a life a of luxury by virtue of your skin colour(it doesn't btw). Like your life may of been awful because of your low income but you don't have the added boon of race holding you back too.",2023-12-07
"Yes, that makes a lot of sense, agree with you.",2023-11-29
But less prestigious,2023-11-19
Maybe a decade ago.,2023-12-17
"Exceptions that proves the rule, there's a reason 2 hours is the industry standard. There's already some complaints about the movie being too long",2023-11-21
"I hear you. I'm coming from a perspective of someone who read the book which has a front row seat to his narcissism and sociopathy, so that gave me a different insight into the film adaption and acting choices through LOTS of internal dialogue. 

Trust me, he is an entitled murderous sociopath. 

It saddens to me to think most people would do what he did. What a shame humanity would really be in that case...",2023-12-13
[deleted],2023-11-24
"Eh, if he was a sociopath at the beginning I don't think he'd have worked so hard to try to feed and keep a roof over his family's head (and let his grandma eat his only food when he was starving). Same with stuff like letting his GF take credit for his hunger games ideas, he even willingly gave her the bullet points.",2024-03-15
your thinking is weird WeIrD.,2023-12-02
It didn't come across to me that he was scared of the game master. But I can see how some people might empathize with that.,2023-12-26
Especially if you’re in a situation where you knew your family basically relied on you to survive.,2023-11-21
"There are a lot of people who say they'd kill for their kids, if anyone ever assaulted them. The majority of parents who've had their children's lives turned upside down don't actually end up murdering the perpetrator. All those school shooters, the worst they'll undergo will be in prison. People do say stuff like this often but real life is complicated and not everyone acts on their feeling slile they think they would.",2023-11-22
"The reapings are definitely rigged, at least by Katniss’ time. She mentions in the books that the children of victors seem to get picked far too often for it to be chance.",2023-12-05
Why is Israel obliged to provide electricity and water to Gaza? Their Hamas government should be providing those things.,2023-12-05
"Yeah it really seems like the districts are relatively isolated settlements, just enough to provide for the capitol's needs in whatever industry and very actively kept from growing beyond their mission. D12 only does coal, so if they ever fuck up the only food, tech, and anything else can be cut off from far away. 

Also lines up with how 12 is entirely destroyed in book 3. They aren't firebombing a whole state, just a small city and surrounding area.",2023-11-27
"yeah it’s so annoying how if you critique the movie or her performance, everyone just assumes it’s bc of a personal bias. like cmon just accept that the movie had some flaws irrelevant to rachel as a person",2023-12-01
Lmao this is so pathetic,2023-11-29
"I’m really not sure how that is plot armour. Plot armour to me is when there is a plot contrivance to prevent a characters death. 

But that isn’t it. He was and is a privileged pacifist who managed to avoid negative consequences because of his wealth but in the end he couldn’t be saved by said wealth

There was no regression like you suggested he remained consistent",2023-11-19
well I mean that's on you 😭,2023-12-04
"He was an idiot, perhaps a noble idiot but it is what it is.He has no one to blame but himself really.",2023-11-23
"> If anything I think the weirdest part of the movie to me was the Lucy/Snow romance. It felt very forced- especially on her end.

Tigris did say that shes all alone and she would want a friendly face. Young Snow is not only friendly, but also kind of handsome, so that latter part probably helped. Might be that Lucy only felt grateful for his help and confused that feeling with love.",2024-01-07
Meh,2023-11-20
"I didn’t read the book and I agree..the movie made it pretty clear that he was leaning towards the side of the Capitol, I thought that the rebels would have killed Lucy and he would turn on Sejanus just from the way his character was developed",2023-12-24
Someone can be a toxic manipulative selfish person without being a sociopath or a psychopath. People throw around those two diagnoses too easily. I don’t think Snow was either of those things. He was a cunning narcissist if anything. Sejanus was also very selfish and entitled even though he was one of the ‘good guys’,2024-01-06
Snow is always more than a sociopath which is why Katiness didn’t kill him and listens to him.,2023-12-09
what about the shooting of the mayor's daughter?,2023-12-02
Dying to take revenge is different to dying to protect someone. It is nowhere near the same thing,2023-11-22

"How do you expect Hamas or Palestinians to build infrastructure when not only does Israel control the flow of goods in and out of Gaza, but they fucking bomb the infrastructure when it's built? https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/25/how-bombings-blockades-and-import-bans-caused-gaza-water-system-to-crumble",2023-12-06
The “to me” in my original comment is probably the piece you’re missing,2023-11-19
"> He was an idiot, perhaps a noble idiot but it is what it is.He has no one to blame but himself really.

And yet he would have been fine if his friend, his self-declared brother, didnt betray him. 

He didnt die because he was naive, because he was privileged or because he was an idiot. He died because he thought he had a friend and that friend was Snow.",2024-01-07
"Hell, I like Hunger Games WAY more than Scorsese, but it’s not the same thing.",2023-11-20
That's fair.,2024-01-06
It's not the same thing but it probably occurs at the same rate,2023-11-23
"Funny you talk about the water system, when the reason Gaza barely has any clean water is because instead of using money to desalinate Hamas dug out water pipes to build tunnels and rockets. They actually showcase themselves doing it in some of their own propaganda videos 🙄",2023-12-23
Why is there a blockade again?,2023-12-06
"Yeah, Hunger Games is more engaging.",2023-11-20
"They were dug up from abandoned Israeli settlements.
Watching videos with no context can be super confusing, totally understand why you’re spreading misinformation. It happens to the best of us and apparently the worst of us (Zionists) too! 

This video has subtitles, hope it helps! 
Thinking for yourself and doing your own research is far more empowering than consuming whatever the elite owned, main stream media bird feeds you. Not a single hostage has said a damaging word about the resistance, I have heard them express fear of being killed by the IOF. I find it interesting that people choose to ignore victim testimonies and refuse to acknowledge the fact that the IOF is responsible for many deaths on October 7th. But yeah……let’s keep talking about the water lines. It’s not like Palestinians are denied the ability to do a single thing without Israel’s permission. If they can’t make minor infrastructure repairs in their homes without permission, how could they be able to build an entire water system? The real question is, why the fuck is Israel outside of their official borders and why are they occupying and controlling land that isn’t theirs? Please stop speaking before critical thinking. Go research how they obtained control of Gazas water system in the first place. It’s not bc the Palestinians chose, they did under necessity. 90% of the drinking water before oct.7th wasn’t even drinkable.

"So, he asks a question and all you do is to just frame him?   
I'm just going to assume that you're a person who hasn't given the whole situation a second thought and is just shouting what everyone else is shouting.   
The situation in Gaza is not a black and white decision.   
It is war and the facts inside Gaza are hard to track and retrace.   
The fact is, Hamas is to blame for the suffering in Gaza and the only chance for Palestine to flourish is with the destruction of Hamas.",2023-12-27
Well you’re clearly uneducated and uninformed with that opinion. Please do thorough research on the situation before commenting. Your take is very ignorant. It’s not much of a war when one side is bombing the shit out of the other killing 1000s of civilians who have no real army to fight back. Seems pretty one sided to me don’t you think? Hamas is the only line of defence they have from an occupying force trying to control their freedom. Really shows how much you know... have u been to gaza? Have u seen how israelis treat people who are ‘other’? I have. My mother had rocks thrown at her by them. Don’t talk to me about what u don’t know. Moron.,2023-12-28
"Ah yes, tells me I'm uneducated and uninformed, without giving any source.   


One-sided? You do realize Hamas is actively shootings rockets at Israel?   
Palestine were giving multiple chances for their own land but decided to go against it. Hamas do see their people as martyr, as people who do need to die for their religion. For the total annihilation of the Jews.  


Ah, you mean how they treated the Hamas chef in their hospitals? How they are giving work to people in a warzone? Building infrastructure?  


Netanjahu has to go. But stop pretending that Israel is to blame for everything. Since the founding of the state, they have been seen as the enemy by all the surrounding countries. Those days are over, Israel will end this once and for all.",2023-12-28
"Source? Lol u asking for sources tells me everything about u. Im not here to educate u. All u have to do is read a flipping book about it, follow journalists on the ground in gaza u idiot. Lil hamas rockets in the grand scheme of things is nothing. I’d shoot rockets at assholes trying to keep me prisoner in my own land too. Fuck israel. There is no hamas in west bank n they’re still killing palestinians, treating them as second class citizens n stealing their damn homes u fool. Israel can burn in hell along with you.
