yes im talking   kens  lot  people  outlined   triumph   movie   reactionary countercoup  puts  repressed underclass back   place   best minor symbolic concessions

 message  ken   despite legitimate grievances  society   whole actually  problem      needs  mentally selfreflect  accept  place   actually   conservative mentality jordan peterson literally   talking point   cant complain  issues  broad society    life isnt fixed
