theres   much  want  talk  thisll    long post      express      comment  downvote try  read   beforehand
  

  
  begin  starters  liked  three movies   one 1  2 seemed like   focused   3 seemed  go   rails  little  still managed  keep  vibe  brand  action  made 1  2  good
  

  
  people found issue  three particular scenes   3 movies  im   talk  two    particular
  

  
 scene  jw2   gets sidehit   car  gets thrown across  room   ending  jw3   falls   building  falls hard  people thought  scenes  ridiculous  terms   damage wick  take  theyre right   extent  suspending disbelief  two little scenes  fine  
  

  
  comes  first issue    john wick 4    suspend disbelief massively throughout  whole movie    terms   action  also    bad cgi  display   last act   movie
  

  
 terms   action  feels like  creatives behind  movie saw  complaints  decided  double  almost   spite john gets ran    car  full speed like 56 times   falls   secondthird floor   building  going  far   fall side ways   car   hit  floor
  

  
    far john gets    whole film sometimes   big ways   brushes   immediately    happen   past movies    extent  doesnt even   bruise   face throughout  whole movie  ridiculous
  

  
 sucks  say    liked  lot   action   hotline miami style scene   abandoned building  paris   camera   incredible  way donnie yen fights   blind man     best ive seen   type  character  cool   charming  meticulous reloading  gun action  still kinda      enough
  

  
 terms   cgi  pains   say  really really bad   paris act  seems like  threw  realism  bad cgi due  budget   make  cool scene  thats  generic action movie thought process     like   movies  realism  meticulousness  key   movie  work
  

  
 get  cant cut transit  make  scene like    real arc de triomphe    ridiculous drivers inside  cars disappearing cars still driving minutes   shootout  started  take place cgi blood   cgi dummies cars motorcycles   didnt even try  look  least bit real  thats    got   john wick franchise
  

  
  doesnt  stop   whole final scene   movie  ridiculous theyre absolutely standing  front   green screen   obvious   tracker character sitting   dog   frame   weird  like hes supposed     isnt  clear  filmed  separately   reason   could  pay proper attention    fake everything around  looked
  

  
 another complaint theres  weird comedic moments    barely    present   past movies  big  guys face   goofy   dies  way   marques body guard dies hes supposedly shot   shotgun point blank   see  face without even  large bullet hole    dog     everyone   theatre laughed even   john falling   stairs  framed  comedic people around  laughed  like  people  charge dont want  take  movie seriously either
  

  
  movie   long  japan action set piece went  way  long   last portion  like enemies kept  showing   things  wouldnt end  coolness  john wick 1   easily john could dispatch  people     movie everyone    part  wearing armor  special suits  make    get shot 100 times  dont die  theyre properly killed  would  okay   fighting didnt drag    incredibly long
  

  
 nightclub scene  kinda cool  pointless  get  stumbled    rules   john    first movies     convoluted  ends  feeling like nothing really matters
  

  
 thought   movie john would take     high table  whatnot  since     franchise  spin offs  cant  end       makes  events   ending   movie feel  pointless
  

  
  john go  japan  literally gets  ton  people killed    blind man   japanese continental owner   spares  daughter    fake  escaped whats  point  john winning  liberating     specific way  hes gonna die afterward   hes alive    faking  death hes got nothing  hide  hes    game  finally technically  one would  going   since bill skarsgards character  dead  therefore  30 million bounty  null
  

  
   tracker character exactly    come     get  information      want money   sake       bigger motivations   initially saves john hes like        get   aspirations   biggest payout possible  like  make  deal  sorts  deal applied  everyone  asks   30 million raise    means anyone could  john  get  money  get  initially wanted  money  information    starts bartering  keeps trying   wick  money  motivations   weird  
  

  
  wilson  let john pass outbleed    stairs    said hed help  get home   literally  one around  hes dying
  

  
 marquis   interesting character   lack  action scenes  pathetic death  made   waste   high table sent    wick  something    support behind   thats  case    high table  chill  wick winning  getting away  everything  almost felt like clancy browns character  glad john    reason

 ending  makes everything pointless    point  lance reddicks character dying   continental  blown     going back  normal   end     killing   high table  still active  nothing  changed    like john made  impact   staying alive  keep  memory   wife    died alive   



  overall weird movie almost like  people  charge   trying  prove  point    lower  effort  push   ridiculousness  sloppiness  people    fine  
  

  
 really disappointed   movie

guns guns  become obsolete weapons  kevlar vest  cool  people   immune  bullets   movie  felt like swords   effective weapons  guns

action  felt  strong regression   action   previous movies  camera started  become  shaky particularly  jhons scenes    action scenes jhon ones  probably   generic   exceptions    walls shot  amazing  club scene  also  good looking  car chase felt cgiish

jhon wick  jhon doesnt quite feel like hes jhon wick  never  truly  control   situation hes  pretty much immune  bullets  gets constantly surrounded taken  surprise    survives    property   getting harmed  bullets also  way  takes  enemies  boring  repetitive

weird factor  like  weird factor   jw franchise  kingpin looking guy  great  sometimes things    little  weird like    kingpin henchmen  using guns  using tomhawks instead   context whatsoever 

side characters side characters  pretty good  dog guy felt   like    jhon wick  jhon wick  wish  bowery king   bigger part   movie

 marquis  marquis  cool   isnt even  sitting member   table hes   random guy  tasked  killing jhon wick  isnt big enough    final enemy   last chapter   saga

 ending   looked  good    beautiful dawn shots  dont think  ending   satisfactory conclusion   story basically jhon lets  get killed    save winston   blind assassin     die  get  freedom back  might aswell   died   last movie  death   dumb  nonsensical  literally achieved nothing everyone  died died  nothing  guy  osaka sacrificed   nothing   also implied  even  blind guy  get killed   weird way  wrap

 japan   far  favourite place   entire john wick franchise  love hiroyuki sanada   didnt disappoint sad  see   dies   didnt fight  even grounds considering   already wounded  also seems     loyal friend  john wick   houses   nothing  downside  dont really understand   fought caine though considering  would  let    walk

 caine  called caine     cane  also kills  brother john   typical john wick fashion  genius  utterly dumb

 overall  felt like  movie   many enemies nobody imo served zero purpose   movie neither  marquis left hand   already  caine imo    left     

 caine  blind   bit  much   particularly   hearing capabilities  incredibly inconsistent  fighting style  cool though

 think without derek kolstad  heart   john wick journey    perhaps  plan   story  ending  high table  collapsing  criminal underworld  like  said lionsgate wouldnt allow  whatever  reason  think  movie suffered   lack  involvement

obviously  action  still    movie   think  new writers dont seem  understand   john wick movie    john   many allies  adversaries    people   skill  style  john wick make john look less special  started  chapter 3   saw sophia killing groups  people    moves  john   everyone  fight waves  henchmen like  nothing   supposed   johns special ability    passed    eneryone else  least akira  caine used different weapons  john   somewhat unique styles  fighting  others   movie    overpowered   script spent  long highlighting   john john  supposed    man    got  call   son stole  car  panicked  youd expect   reaction   son stole  car  anyone  chapter 4   makes  character  wick  much less special
