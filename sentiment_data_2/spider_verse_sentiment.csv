  movie    long run time  honestly felt like way  much stuff packed     several locations  wanted  see    take  time around   felt like  spidey hq stuff could    majority   second half  would   explore  area     characters  bit 
   visuals  stunning  usual   get  bit overwhelming  times    hard  see   going   like spider punks newspapersketchy quality     bit distracting     many color flashes  scenes      talking 
  gwens universe  kinda seemed like   times   didnt know  direction  wanted  go     scenes  shes arguing   father   many shots   entire color palette would change   whim  looks cool   shots  seemed unfocused  others
   action scenes needed   tightened   often  much happening   screen  many different color effects    hard  follow   going  also  editing seemed  bit weird   places
 sure     theaters fault   voices   low   scenes especially  opening monolog also characters talked     lot  made  hard  understand  jokes
finally      weird opinion    movie  heavily focuses  family   struggles  parentingits kinda weird  peter b took  small baby  many life threatening situations  pregnant spider woman definitely       field     far along  know   cartoon  still
